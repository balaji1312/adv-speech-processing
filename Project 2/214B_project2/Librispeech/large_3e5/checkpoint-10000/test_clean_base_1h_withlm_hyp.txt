Line_82	MISTER SAHMER'S WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWELMED BY THIS FLOUD OF INFORMATION
Line_83	HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DESTERBANCE OF THE QUIET RETEEN OF HIS LIFE
Line_84	DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
Line_85	SO IT SEEMS TO ME
Line_86	YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
Line_87	MY SCOLLOR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POORE BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
Line_88	I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
Line_89	THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
Line_90	HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEE IN THE DOOR
Line_91	O I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SO SIR
Line_92	ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DESCREETLY
Line_93	I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE ROAT WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLLISH SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
Line_94	HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT YOUSING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
Line_95	THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
Line_96	AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOLMS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
Line_97	ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
Line_98	I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO YOUSE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
Line_99	WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDYINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTRABLE MAN
Line_100	AS HOMS DROWH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND AN ALERTNESS OF HIS ATITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
Line_101	LET US HEAR THE SUSPITTIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
Line_102	THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE ONEUSTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPITION
Line_103	THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
Line_104	THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEAISED THE NEXT
Line_105	THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
Line_106	YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
Line_107	I WILL ENDEVER IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONSERNED
Line_108	I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOMES
Line_109	BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
Line_110	HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREET VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
Line_111	I HAD TO REED IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
Line_112	A BROKEN TIPP OF LED WAS LYING THERE ALSO
Line_113	I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD ACCERED
Line_114	THE ALTURNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEE IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
Line_115	MY FRIENDS TEMPOR HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SRROUNDINGS OF BAKERSTREET
Line_116	I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
Line_117	I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
Line_118	TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
Line_119	NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BOL OF BLACK DO OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
Line_120	NOW MISTER SOMS AT YOUR DISPOSAL
Line_121	HOMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALO WHAT IS THIS
Line_122	HOAUMS HAD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT

Line_124	AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
Line_125	ANY ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
Line_126	ONLY FOR A MINUT OR SO
Line_127	I DEARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
Line_128	I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
Line_129	ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPITION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
Line_130	WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTISS THERE ARE OTHERS
Line_131	HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS EN EN AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
Line_132	DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
Line_133	THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTO WITH HIS NECK CRAINED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
Line_134	WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
Line_135	THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MARLZS MACLEARIN
Line_136	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COUOLD KNOW
Line_137	TO MORROW AS THE EXAMINATION
Line_138	IT WOLD BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
Line_139	IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DELEMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE COLPRET TO COMPETE FOR THE VALIABLE SCOLLERSHIP
Line_140	YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
Line_141	THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
Line_142	JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOMS
Line_143	HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONUST MAN
Line_144	I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BY

Line_146	HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILECRIST
Line_147	MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILIOAR BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
Line_148	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
Line_149	NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
Line_150	NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
Line_151	WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
Line_152	THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OVE
Line_153	HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS AND HIS OWN OFFICE

Line_160	NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT

Line_166	HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
Line_167	HE PUT HIS SHOWS ON THE TABLE
Line_168	THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOMS
Line_169	IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARCIAL

Line_277	YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
Line_278	IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADDN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
Line_279	SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVEBEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER

Line_282	THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TUTCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
Line_283	SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDONED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACREFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
Line_284	HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILES OF TRAVEL AND THE TROFIES OF THE CHACE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSIXS THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
Line_285	IT SOUNDED DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
Line_286	IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DUGLISS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTRESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
Line_287	CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
Line_288	THE FIRST OF THESE TUTCHES CONVAID THAT THE RITTAEIN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
Line_289	LET ME SAY HERE DESTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
Line_290	YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEARE BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
Line_291	HEVEN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TO

Line_311	THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
Line_312	THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILD HOOD
Line_313	NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
Line_314	THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIELENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMERY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
Line_315	VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLOUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
Line_316	WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AND INFLOUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPALES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIAD OF IMNFENCY AND CHILD HOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
Line_317	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PEATSA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE IN TO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PEATSA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
Line_318	SO SAYING SHE LEAD THE WAY ON TIPTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A SIRCUIETOUS RUIT TO THE PIATSA THERE
Line_319	I AM VERY GLAD
Line_320	NOWDILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLOUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DALLS
Line_321	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODS OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL ORE RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLOUENCE ARE SPECIALLY YOUSEFUL
Line_322	THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DALLS IN THE PARLOUR
Line_323	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
Line_324	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
Line_325	PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
Line_326	YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA ANDELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANES DAL TO MAKE ROSILY A VISIT
Line_327	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAY THINGS SEE
Line_328	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JAINE
Line_329	AND THIS METHOD OF TREETING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSE TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMOLAR FALT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSD PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
Line_330	DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSEN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
Line_331	DELLIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKENED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSILLY HER AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
Line_332	FORE LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINTSE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
Line_333	AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN COUPS AND GOLDEN PLATS IN LONG ROSE
Line_334	AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
Line_335	IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOW YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
Line_336	BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEAN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
Line_337	HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKNIFE
Line_338	HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BRAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
Line_339	WITH ONE JUMP ANTERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
Line_340	HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTEAGE
Line_341	SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
Line_342	SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
Line_343	YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
Line_344	THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANAPY WITH BOCAZS OF ROSES AND SHELET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
Line_345	ANDER'S FACE GROW RED
Line_346	AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
Line_347	I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
Line_348	BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_349	HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_350	BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
Line_351	WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
Line_352	AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNIDTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
Line_353	NOW MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
Line_354	ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PERIMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
Line_355	NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDED ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLAIDE WAS GONE AND THE HANDELE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
Line_356	THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
Line_357	BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TA IT OFF
Line_358	HE DARTED LAKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
Line_359	THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
Line_360	THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHACE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONTINENTE GOS AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICSE
Line_361	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOME WHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTILL WE ARE GONE
Line_362	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESINE
Line_363	THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
Line_364	THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THEIR REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
Line_365	AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MERRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUOMELT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPITTION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SIRGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPARABLE INJURY
Line_366	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
Line_367	IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF COULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERATED
Line_368	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
Line_369	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
Line_370	BUT FHILLOP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
Line_371	IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMAN TOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
Line_372	WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANY WHERE IT'S IN A BOX VALED AND PINIENED AND SHOT IN BY DISABILITIES
Line_373	FATHER THESE UNJUST TO FILLUP HE'S GOING INTO BUISINESS
Line_374	AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THE DOES LEARN MEDISON
Line_375	I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSICK THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
Line_376	IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KIKAPOOS
Line_377	IF I CAN GET PASIEANCE
Line_378	AND IF I HAD A FORTOON WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A YOUSELESS LIFE
Line_379	RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIST IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MOSOLIEM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECCOWING ROOMS AND NO COMFTERBLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMIDATION OF ANY BODY
Line_380	MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEDISON
Line_381	WHERE THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
Line_382	THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
Line_383	HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUONS ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A KNEW COUNTRY
Line_384	SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PEANOW SAING A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY MATALIC VOICE AND THEN SEETING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ FHILLOPS LETTER
Line_385	I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM ROUITH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDEANCE WITH HERS
Line_386	THE SIGHTESEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
Line_387	RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE IN TENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
Line_388	WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
Line_389	I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN AVENER THAT HE WAS WIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WISCLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
Line_390	IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONET
Line_391	IS THE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING ROUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
Line_392	AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREET
Line_393	BUT THAT WISE AND PLASSID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REABLE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
Line_394	I WILL PRACTICE IT
Line_395	DOES THE THINK THEE COULD STAND IT SIX MONTHS
Line_396	HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER OF THE WANTS
Line_397	SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
Line_398	I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DIEMEURE PERSON
Line_399	AND THE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
Line_400	IS THY FATHER WILLING THE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
Line_401	BUT NEITHER SAINT JERARD NORE BROAUDSTREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MENT NORE THE GLORYES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECOLORATION IMPRESSED THE VISITERS SO MUCH AS THE SPLINDERS OF THE CHESTNET STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON AITH STREET
Line_402	RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT FHILLIP HAD MADE A PUSHONTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALLENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
Line_403	WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIANCE
Line_404	THE STUADDY MEISIEN
Line_405	IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEAK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LIE IN THE CURBSTONE AND SERATUS AS WE COME OUT
Line_406	THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIEN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCTECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EY COULD REST
Line_407	MARGRET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLECIDITY
Line_408	HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTEERE AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLETTE AS A WENSDAY MEETING HUN IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
Line_409	I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOME
Line_410	PHILLOP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ACSTER LIBROARY PLANED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPELL ATTENTION AND NIRSHED HIS GENIOUS
Line_411	THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALLSTREET OFFICE OF HENRIY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATER
Line_412	HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
Line_413	HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITER OF THE DAILY GRAPE VINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
Line_414	BUT PFHYLLP DID AFFORD IT AND HE ROAT THINKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SKEM WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
Line_415	TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSE WHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUON ARE INUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORISEN
Line_416	IT IS SUCH AN NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITTY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
Line_417	THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP IN RITING LETTERS FOR FHILLOP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
Line_418	YOU'LL NEVER DIG IT OUT OF THE ASTER LIBREARY
Line_419	O VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
Line_420	HE HAS NO TRODITIONS TO BUIND HIM OR GUID HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BRAKE AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
Line_421	AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRENCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
Line_422	I'VE BEEN READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
Line_423	WHY IT'S IN MASURY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTEER I THINK WE'LL GET A MAP
Line_424	WAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK AND THE ANTY ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS RIGTING FHILLOP INVERIABLY ADVISZED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISCUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTISS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDENT FIEESE
Line_425	SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPITIOUS POULPET AND HUMBLLY PREACH THE GOSPLE OF REPENTENTS AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISTIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIDED REAGION WHERE THE DATE PAM GROWS AND THE NIGHTANGAL'S VOICE IS IN TOONE AND THE BOULBL SINGS ON THE OFFNIGHTS
Line_426	THE MODYST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THREST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ATCHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LUTENEATES STRAINE OR DOCTOR KAIN
Line_427	HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
Line_428	NO IT'S NOT TOO SOON
Line_429	HE WELL KNEW THE PERROLS OF THE FROANTEER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LERKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF PHEVER
Line_430	WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINERE YOU COULD GO AS ONE
Line_431	YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROAD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
Line_432	HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LATTER
Line_433	THE PECURLAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXOLENCIY'S NOWLEDGE
Line_434	THEIR MASTERS SAID MISSUS NEVER BEND
Line_435	MISSUS NEVERBEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROD OF YOUR SON
Line_436	OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_437	I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHOORS MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUOARTER OF THE WORLD
Line_438	TO DAY I SHOUTED
Line_439	JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
Line_440	THEN THE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
Line_441	THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A CURTICY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
Line_442	WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
Line_443	WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLACKS SAID MY WIFE
Line_444	THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
Line_445	MISTER NEVER BEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVE THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
Line_446	WE HAVE OUR LITTLE SHRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CAN NOT BE DONE BY ROSEWATER
Line_447	YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDOW BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTOLACKS
Line_448	AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMP COULD NOT ALASS
Line_449	AND THIS PLAN WAS ADDOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISS THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
Line_450	IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGE WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SERVIVE THAT PERIAD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN SEASE TO WORK
Line_451	I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTOLACKS TO TUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
Line_452	JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
Line_453	THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTER
Line_454	YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
Line_455	SIR KENNGTON OVEL IS A VERY FIN PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
Line_456	THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEN SAID SIR FERDENANDO BROWN
Line_457	THE JAHM BRIGHT HIS ARM WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANULA SHOULD PREVAL
Line_458	THE LADIES IN COMPLYIENCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTARISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
Line_459	I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRESTWELLEARS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BORD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
Line_460	YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT CURTICY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
Line_461	BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
Line_462	BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
Line_463	YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTH WEST BURMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SUECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEN BE WITH DRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEEDIENCE
Line_464	THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
Line_465	QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVA
Line_466	THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
Line_467	OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEN HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROW SUCCESS
Line_468	OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NO WHERE
Line_469	BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICOLTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNER
Line_470	HOW MUCH OF EAVEL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EAVEL HAD THERE NOT ACCERED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
Line_471	THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THEM
Line_472	YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DISTRUCTION
Line_473	AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCISES OF THE GOVERMENT
Line_474	THEN SAID SIR FERDENANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
Line_475	I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY PAROLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEAL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONSERNED Y OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUITE FORCE
Line_476	NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
Line_477	I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BORD
Line_478	AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
Line_479	I REMAINE THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
Line_480	BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISCRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
Line_481	HAD EIVER CRESWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINTON OVEL REMAIND IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
Line_482	MY WIFE ON THE SPER OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
Line_483	THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEVERED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
Line_484	YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLACKS AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BORD
Line_485	I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERDNANDO
Line_486	WHEN DOYOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL START
Line_487	WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HERE AFTER
Line_488	WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSESSED AT THE FIRTHERST SIDE OF THE ILAND AND THERE IN SUCCLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
Line_489	THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTANT AND THE BRITTISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXHALTED AND A BRITTISH GOVERNOR ENSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
Line_490	SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXOLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNER OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITTANULA
Line_491	NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORSE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
Line_492	LUTENENT CROSS TRIES IS A VERY GALENT OFFICSER
Line_493	BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITANNULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATLY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICOLTIES
Line_494	WE SAT WITH THE OFFICOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHOORE
Line_495	WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND D

Line_499	IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISS TO MEET CAPTAMB ATTALACKS HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JAM BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
Line_500	YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION

Line_676	NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
Line_677	ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
Line_678	FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHER TWO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
Line_679	THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTENT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY YUSELESS
Line_680	ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPEAD AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEAPTHS OF OTION WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AULGERIAN MATROPOLIS
Line_681	YOU MUST SEE LUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
Line_682	THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UN EASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
Line_683	ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREESE WAS BLOWING THE SEE WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FORE ONLY BY THE DIMUNIUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BOIENT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF ISOLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRESIDENTED
Line_684	AFTER AN APPRENTIS SHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YOT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCOUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGH OUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CROOSING IN THE MEDITORANIAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
Line_685	ITS DEAPTH REMAINED INVEARIABLE STILL FOR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARRAN OF MARIN PRODUCTION OF ANY TIPE
Line_686	TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LAUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORME DEAPTH OF FROM FOR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO OURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE ARIA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVLE WERE INSIGNIFICENT NOT CORISPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SIGHT OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRISED LIKE THE SEETS OF AN AMTHATHIATER
Line_687	IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISSAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
Line_688	WOULD NOT THE LOGHTYEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
Line_689	IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
Line_690	SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHOORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMET OF THE CLIFF ALLTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
Line_691	HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSESSED
Line_692	LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
Line_693	ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETATCHMENT OF IMFENTRY THROUGH AN INTRENCHMENT
Line_694	BENSOUFS MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSENTLY WERE SERVIDECK'S EARS BESEEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPEAROLELLED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH OUR AUNDISIMONL OF PEARRIS THAT HE COULD SCARSLY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSIAN
Line_695	NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BERGOSE ITSELF COULD VIE WITH A CHERCH AT MONTMARTRA
Line_696	UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENTION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTABLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN SIKCLOAPIEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANICDOTS AND TRUPERS TAILS HE WAS MACHLESS
Line_697	WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVERET SAYING AMONXST ARTILORY OFFICORS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHERK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVELOUS PERSUTS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSD THAT SERVADACK BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
Line_698	THE BOND OF UNIAN THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENSOUF'S ATCHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIRMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONOURS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOAR OFFICOER
Line_699	WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADACK
Line_700	AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TI MIS CITIZEN OF LOQCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIOUS WHOM ALL ATHEENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMULARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRETIES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
Line_701	THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
Line_702	NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUND IT YOORS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS OUR ANNELS RECORED
Line_703	OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE HA LATUOKE IN THE PERSUTE OF WISDOM SERCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
Line_704	THEN THOU LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMES WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOFER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MAN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZINS OF WHOM THE EAGIPTION RECORDS SPOKE
Line_705	MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTER PART OF YORS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDAN TIME
Line_706	BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
Line_707	TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERES SOLLON HEARD THIS STORY
Line_708	AND NOW HIS DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
Line_709	SULLEN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
Line_710	AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POIM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
Line_711	THE MOST FANEOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVER THROW OF THE ILAND OF ATLANTIS
Line_712	FORE IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHINS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF SITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNTHER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
Line_713	THIS IS THE EXPLENATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OTION
Line_714	SOME POIMS OF SOLLEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
Line_715	FOR AT THE PEROL OF HER OWN EXISTANCE AND WHEN THE OTTHER HELLINS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVATER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLERS
Line_716	I WILL IF TO ME AS APPROVES I APPROVE
Line_717	I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL REED THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEASURE IN THE SACRED REAGISTERS
Line_718	SOPERATIES BEGINS THE TIMERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
Line_719	BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPS OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
Line_720	THE GIENIALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RESITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMAL SOLLEN ARE A MER CHILDREN'S STORY
Line_721	BUT IN EAGIPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
Line_722	LISTEN THEN SO CRITIC TO A TALE OF SOLLENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF JROPITOUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD TO MY GRANDFATHER CRIDIOUS AND HE TOLD ME
Line_723	NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCOUSTOMED MANNER
Line_724	THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFACT OF RITHEM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER YUSE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPATITION THAN ACCURS IN PLAITOS EARLYER RIGHTINGS
Line_725	BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MESTERY OVER HIS INSTRAMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS INTHER PHEDRAS OR SIMPOSIAM
Line_726	MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELIMENTS OF THE PRESOCRETIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMEIS
Line_727	PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
Line_728	THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THIOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CARECTORISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REAALLIZE IN CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
Line_729	WITH HERACLITIS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUCXS LIKE AN EXCEGORIS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINENCES OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELIMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHEGORIEGIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
Line_730	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DILOGS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TUTRILLIDIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
Line_731	AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSYNESS IN THE TIMES OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILASOPHICAL POWIM OF LEOCRITIOUS
Line_732	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
Line_733	THE STIL AND PLENE OF THE TIMEIS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOQS
Line_734	HE PASSES ABROUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEVENS TO MAN FROM AESTRONEMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES AR RATHER DOES NOT DESTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF JIOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN THE FLUDS OF SENCE
Line_735	THE DIALOB IS PRIMARILY CONSERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLOUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
Line_736	BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATOL AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
Line_737	HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE STILE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER IN THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOFER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
Line_738	THE FANCIES OF THE NEED PLATENISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A FAZE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVALED WIDELY IN THE FIRST SENTORIES OF THE CRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT HOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
Line_739	THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TIPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
Line_740	IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOFHER IS TO BE INTRBPUTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
Line_741	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDISIN AND MATHOMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN INPIETY IN RINKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF NOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOL
Line_742	IN THE SUPPOSED DEAPTHS OF THIS DIEOLOG THE NEDO PLATENISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JUISH AND CRISTIANS SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINS QUITE AT VERIENCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
Line_743	BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGWAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
Line_744	THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MADEREN COMMENTATERS ON THE TIMES FALLING INTO THE OBSERDITIES OF THE NEO PLATENISTS
Line_745	THE INFLOUENCE WHICH THE TIMES HAS EXERSISZED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISS UNDERSTANDING
Line_746	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN IS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAG
Line_747	THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SICOLOEGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
Line_748	FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
Line_749	A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
Line_750	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACURASY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDMENTAL CASES BE BACED UPON A CARACTORISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODDILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
Line_751	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPAL IS LIABLE TO ACCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROCIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
Line_752	I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BRECFOST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
Line_753	THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTANCE IN VERTU OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFONITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
Line_754	IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ELUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
Line_755	IN AN IMEGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEELL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACURASY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UN FAMILIAR PARTS
Line_756	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARIVE AT
Line_757	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR NOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFONITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLIM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONSERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIASY
Line_758	SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEL STRANGE
Line_759	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT ACCURANCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
Line_760	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_761	THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
Line_762	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTARISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFEARING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
Line_763	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
Line_764	ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALOCIS OF WHAT ACCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
Line_765	THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HIPOTHESCIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UN REAL PAST
Line_766	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VERIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTNESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
Line_767	SYMENS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLYER LECTURE DO NOT TUTCH NOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
Line_768	THERE MAY BE A SPECIPHIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONSERNED
Line_769	THE DEFONITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICLT BROAUDLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VERIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
Line_770	THUS NO NOWLEGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FILLING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
Line_771	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
Line_772	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAG WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE IMNFLOUENCE OF FATEEGE WE MAY SEE A FRIENDS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORIBLY DESTORTED
Line_773	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ACCURANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEFE THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST ACCURANCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTS NOWLEDGE MEMORY
Line_774	A GRAMIFONE BY THE HELP OF SUTABLE RECOURDS MIGHT RELAT TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMIFONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
Line_775	IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELLINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELLINGS MUST PLAY AN ESCENTRAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_776	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADIQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMATIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELLAMENTORY ACCURANCE AS RECOGNITION
Line_777	RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY ENVALVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN ODITORY IMEGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTORISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
Line_778	WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ESSOCIATS IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
Line_779	THIS DESTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTISE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
Line_780	IT IS THIS THAT IS A VENTEREST TO THEORY OF NOWLEGE
Line_781	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN NOWLEGE THE WHOLE PROBLM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
Line_782	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INATIQUACT TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
Line_783	I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_784	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECIGHT A POIM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECIDED OR READ IT
Line_785	THE ANALECIS OF NOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTILL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICLT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
Line_786	THE FIRST OF OUR VAGE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS NOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_787	BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN IMFERENCE IS WARENTED
Line_788	HABIT IS A CONCEPT ENVALVING THE ACCURANCE OF SIMOLAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A FHENOMENONE AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
Line_789	WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY ACCURS WITHOUT A DEFENATE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SERCH THE ENVIRMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
Line_790	IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ATCHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ATCHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHOUDS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TRO THE GREAT ECONOMICA LAW OF VOAICAND EFFORT
Line_791	THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELES OF INDIGEANCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMBS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEASED TO CONSUME VALLIABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOL EXPONENT OF THE HOUSE HOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY
Line_792	CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELIMENT IN THE STANDERD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
Line_793	THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO OBJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIERE OR SPIRITUAL NEED
Line_794	THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONCIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
Line_795	IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
Line_796	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
Line_797	IT IS ALSO NOTICABLE THAT THE SERVICABILITY OF CONSEMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUT AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELAMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTECT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
Line_798	THE DEPENDANT WHO WAS FIRST DELIGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTIMARLY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
Line_799	IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESANT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEASURE
Line_800	EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROTH
Line_801	THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
Line_802	VERY MUCH OF SQUOLLOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY
Line_803	IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT HOLY NOR CONSISTANTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINSITE
Line_804	AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIAM OF NEIGHBORHOD GOSSIP SUFFISCIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PERPOS OF PECUNIARY REPUT
Line_805	BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCAIL THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARAS LEASURE AND CONSEMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
Line_806	THERE IS A MOROLESS ELABERATE SISTOM OF RANKEND GRATES
Line_807	THE COUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINU TO BE THE SOL MOTIVES
Line_808	WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENEAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIMARY LEASURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES A REFLECTED ONARIFIC CHARACTER
Line_809	THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCES AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIABLE
Line_810	IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUGGURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEASUR CLASS
Line_811	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEASUR CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIVELY PREDITORY EMPLOYMENTS
Line_812	SUCH CONSEMPTION AS FALLS THROUH THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSEMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
Line_813	DRUNKNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULENCES THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNORIFPIC AS BEING A MARKS AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFOID THE INDULGENCE
Line_814	THE UTILITY OF CONSEMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A GERIVATIVE GROWTH
Line_815	IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DESIEESED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISZING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIEN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SINENIM FOR NOBLE OR GENTAL
Line_816	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTATCHED TO THE PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS AT CETRA
Line_817	THE CONCEMPTION OF LUGUORIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONCEMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
Line_818	SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERISON OF THE PATRIAN MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
Line_819	WITH A FIRTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABUMAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGAROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THIORETICAL BACIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCEAM OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
Line_820	BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTIDATING THE IMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS SELABERATE SISTOM
Line_821	THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOCTIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR ITT
Line_822	THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMAN'S TRESS AND HOUSE HOLD PARIFOINAILIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RUL BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS ECXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANCIAL
Line_823	THE WEARORS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUFLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
Line_824	WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RUL IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENIFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
Line_825	BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVER LOOKED
Line_826	MANY OF THESE AFFILLIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEASURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESS A MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARSELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARCIALLY TO BERATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMARS
Line_827	UNDER THE TABOU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERIGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOAR CLASS
Line_828	THIS DIFFERENSCIATION IS FIRTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
Line_829	THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUME ITS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
Line_830	BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGWAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRICATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERISED THUS WASTEFUL
Line_831	UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF AFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTIZING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEASURE AND THE CONSPICUS CONSEMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY AMULATION PRITTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
Line_832	IN STRICT ACCURASY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
Line_833	THE SAIL AND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
Line_834	BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCEAM LEASURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTFUL CONSEMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELAMENT IN THE STANDERD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSI PECIBL CULTURE
Line_835	OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF PERMITTING THAT INSTINGT DESPOSES MEAN TO LOOK WITH FAVER UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFISCIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
Line_836	AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTFUL BOTH AND IT'S CUTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARING PROPORTIONS
Line_837	THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE EMPLYES NO DEPROCATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANNAN OF CONSPICUS WASTE
Line_838	A RECONSILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIRMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AN INTRICATE POLIGHT OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A SERIMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS AE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMILIARATION EMBODYED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STILAN TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK IS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALLEW OF THEIR TRAPHIC
Line_839	AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRICATION
Line_840	THE GOATS WAR LIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
Line_841	THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROSE OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATERS TO SIT UPON
Line_842	AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLGIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BULAROU
Line_843	WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BULAROU LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUSLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
Line_844	THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STILE OF WHISKERS AND THE'RE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDED
Line_845	MORNING GIRLS HOW PEVILL AS WELL AS YE LOOK
Line_846	AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIFE THE BULAROU GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
Line_847	THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_848	HOLD HIM FAST MY MAN AND AS SOON AS IVE HAD MY COFFEY AND OATMILL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIFE AND PATCH HIM
Line_849	I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BOWNED SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I AM LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIVE MY FEELINGS
Line_850	BUT CATAMBILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE YOUSELESS
Line_851	I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MADE TO ESCAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE
Line_852	BEFORE ANNY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAGISTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SORED FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEEP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MONING AND GROWNING
Line_853	SUPPOSE IT'S OF BRIEND
Line_854	WHY YOU SENT TO FECH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THE SPILLYGOATE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOATS HORNS
Line_855	RICH JULES OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PURSONS AND THE ROIAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGIOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVER BARING
Line_856	THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURT YARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS THAT THE SAILEARMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
Line_857	I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP COFFY MYSELF SAID CAMBILL I'VE HAD CONCIDRABLE EXCERSISED THIS MORNENEN AND I'M ALL READY FOR BRECKFAST
Line_858	COME AND GET THE BULAROU SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES
Line_859	THEREFORE HER MAGISTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
Line_860	IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROIAL FAMILY WITH ELIGENT THROWN CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEAN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY APPOSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
Line_861	CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BULAROUW THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PEATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
Line_862	FINE CLARIOS
Line_863	THE IDEA OF PATCHING CATAMBILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE RORED WITH LAFTER
Line_864	THEN THEY SPEAD IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOATGAVE A FINAL BUT THAT SENT THE RO OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE COURADOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREAPON THEY SHREEKED IN A MANNEUR THAT TERRIFIED EVERY ONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
Line_865	THE PLEASANT GRAVEYARD OF MY SOUL WITH CENTIMENTAL SIPROUS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I MAY STROLE IN MEDITATION AT MY EASE
Line_866	IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAY FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIYE
Line_867	WHILE THE OLD GOLD AND THE MARBLES DAYZSE FOR EVER GLEAMING ITS SOFT STRAWNG BLAYZE CALM IN THE EARLY EVENING GLOW
Line_868	HE HAD GOT INTO HER COURT YARD
Line_869	IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SALS ARE FURLD WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPISTRIES RICH AND OLD
Line_870	THAT WAS BUT RUSLING OF TRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK
Line_871	THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS
Line_872	HO YE SALES THAT SEEM TO WONDER IN DREAME FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THIS SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WINDGUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEE OF WATERY ECOS
Line_873	OLD DANCES ARE SYMPLIFIED OF THEIR YURNING BLEACHED BY TIME
Line_874	GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDAINS INTIMATE WITH HOLLY HOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLES WHERE BERCHES BAND TO CONFIDONTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMBED WITH A LILLY PLANTS
Line_875	OVER THE TRACKLINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MAN THE GRINNING MAN PASS
Line_876	SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT
Line_877	HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURT YARD
Line_878	THE PITTY THAT WE MUST COME AND GO
Line_879	BRIGHTER THAN ERLY DAWNES MOST BRILLIENT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLLER THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWORL AND SWEAP AND MEAT TO BRAKE AND FOME LIKE RAIMBOW VILLS UPON A BOBLE'S DOME
Line_880	VENUS
Line_881	SINCE LAST THIRSDAY I GIPP GACIZEL HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BULAROUW OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONCKURED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONKERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BULAROUW AT ALL
Line_882	IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
Line_883	THE COMBINE BANDS OF BOTH THE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPER WAS SERVED
Line_884	SO GIPGACISL ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOME
Line_885	I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISSED THE NEW BULAROUW AND I'LL FEED THE HONOURABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LETHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
Line_886	AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GITGACISL AND BUTTAN BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PRET ON HIS SHOLDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORELLIY AND CAPTAIN TIN TENT AND ROSELY THE WITCH
Line_887	WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THROWN ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE AS SCIMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND GEARED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
Line_888	SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBAY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF SCIMBLES TOLD TROT AND CATAINBILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASCEMBLED BEFORE THE PALLIS
Line_889	THE FORMAR BULARUEW GRONED
Line_890	YOU ARE A MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
Line_891	NOW THEN LETS ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST ITS BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STARVE MYSELF FOR THIS CONCURING KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
Line_892	WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
Line_893	AS A PRIVATE CITISEN I SHALL BE A MODDEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
Line_894	THEN SHE GAVE ROSELY BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
Line_895	WHEN THE BLUE SKAN SAW GITTKACISL THEY RAIZED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUBT FOR HE WAS THE FAVERET OF THE SOLGIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
Line_896	THAT EVENING TROAT GAVE A GRAND BAWL IN THE PALIS TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIES AND THE BLUESKINS WERE ENVITED
Line_897	EXCUSE ME SAID SHRAHT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BULAROUW ANY MORE
Line_898	THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BULAROUE OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THROWN ROOM OF THE PALLIS
Line_899	THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
Line_900	HU L NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD BULAROUW OUR REFORM
Line_901	DON'T WORRY SIZZLE DEAR IT ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
Line_902	HE DARTED TROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MAIDE
Line_903	HE SPLASHED AND STEAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE KNEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
Line_904	HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
Line_905	THE WORLD WAS WATER VALED IN MISTS
Line_906	THE HOPE AND DREAME OF HARVIST WAS UPON THE LAND
Line_907	PERHAPS SHE TWO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEAPING
Line_908	HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ILAND A GREAT SHEET OF DASILING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENIEETH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALLOVE GREAN THICK TALL WEAT AND WILLOWY
Line_909	ON SHE HURRIED UNTILL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ILAND LOW THE COTTAIN LAY BEFORE HER
Line_910	THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BRETH OF AIR STIRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEAL THE EIRTH STEAMED
Line_911	THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
Line_912	THE REVOLLATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
Line_913	AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
Line_914	HERE LAY THE REEDING OF THE RIDDL WITH INFINATE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANNAWL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMOR HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
Line_915	HE GAIZED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
Line_916	THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
Line_917	HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPER MOST SORA
Line_918	FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPED WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZILY AGAINST THE TREE
Line_919	SHE ROSE WITH A FLEEDING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
Line_920	WHERE WAS THE YOUSE OF IMAGINING
Line_921	THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVELED WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
Line_922	SHE WAS SO STRANGE IND HUMAN A CREATURE
Line_923	HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEACZE HIS AND SORAS MUST BE RUINED
Line_924	THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
Line_925	THE SQUAIRS OF COTTEIN SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BIRST TO BOLES
Line_926	THE NEAD AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DOME SPEACHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLE FOR HER LIFE WITH NARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
Line_927	HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TWOW KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
Line_928	FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE ITS SON AND BIRD AND TREE
Line_929	IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTAIN ITSELF BUT THE FANTICY THE HOPES THE DREAMES BUILT AROUND IT
Line_930	SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITH IN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
Line_931	UP IN THE SICK ROOMSORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WIDE BED
Line_932	I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR AS CAPPASITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HARTILY SECONDED HIM
Line_933	BUT WE ARE NOT A EXACTLY WELCOME
Line_934	BUT CRESTWELL ADDED SIGNIFICENTLY COMPASITY DIFFERS INNORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
Line_935	MARRY TAILOW HOWEVER RELATED THE TAILE OF SORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
Line_936	THE VANDERPOOLES WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELEQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MISTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADDMINT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIGUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPERTUNITIES TO THEM
Line_937	SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGROW EDUCATION
Line_938	DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARRY TAILER
Line_939	WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
Line_940	THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SIRA'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER ESTERLEYE'S WALLSTREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
Line_941	FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOL NOR THE KNOSAND SOUTHERNERS ALL ARIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
Line_942	POSATIVELY HEROWIC ADDED CREASTWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
Line_943	AS SHE AWAITED HER GUEST SHE SERVAGD THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND IS QUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO KNIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKD THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIGHTEN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRIGHTEN MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOLE MISTER HARRY CRESTWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAILER AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATE SENETER FROM NEW JERSY A SELECTION OF GUESS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTIS BY THE MEETING OF CONTAIN INTREST EARLYER IN THE DAY
Line_944	AT LAST THE COTTEN COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSUORED FACT AND HE WAS SLAITED FOR THE SENET
Line_945	MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVITELY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROWS A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTH WITH
Line_946	SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTIBLY INTELIGEANT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELIGEANCE IN OTHERS
Line_947	MISS TAILER DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTEIN BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKED SEEMED CALLED FOR
Line_948	BUT JOAHWN THERE'S NO SUCIETY JUST ELIMENTORY WORK
Line_949	SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TUTCH AND SIGHT
Line_950	THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPRAT PROSE
Line_951	HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODEORS AND BODDILY PERSPORATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
Line_952	THE GOLDEN FLEACE IT'S THE SILVER FLEACE HE HARKENED
Line_953	THE GLIMORING SEE OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
Line_954	CATTEN SHE PAUSED
Line_955	MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING YOUSEFUL DOWN THERE
Line_956	THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OVE SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMET SHE WAS NOT A VIERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLENDS
Line_957	HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
Line_958	SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTEIN COUNTY
Line_959	SO FOR THE HUNDRETH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LAIN BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUH THE BOTTUMS
Line_960	I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
Line_961	BETTER GO HE HAD COUNCILED SENTENTIOUSLY
Line_962	SOME TIME YOU'LD TELL ME PLEAZE WON'T YOU
Line_963	AT ANY RATE I SAY GO
Line_964	GOUBAS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF BANS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAIAMS IS THAT SO
Line_965	YOU AUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROWS I'LL SCARSELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
Line_966	SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIOTICLS AND TALK OF GRATE FILANTHERPIES AND REFORMS
Line_967	NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTAIN
Line_968	DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWORDLY COMMENTED MISS TAILER LITTERLY BORN IN COFTTAIN AND O WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE YUSE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
Line_969	FIND SOME CRESTWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
Line_970	IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SEENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENSE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
Line_971	BEEN LOOKING UP TOOMS COUNTY
Line_972	JOHN TAILER WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER FU COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTEIN
Line_973	CAUGHTEN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
Line_974	YOU KNOW CAPTIN LEAKS
Line_975	I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
Line_976	O I KNOW THAT'S LORNE BRANDEN
Line_977	I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
Line_978	SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING ME
Line_979	AT DINNER LEAK WAS EASY AND AMUSING
Line_980	AND WILDER LAUGHED TWO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOIZSILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKES SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLENT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARTHY ONLY REMARKING
Line_981	DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I'VE REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
Line_982	ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
Line_983	I'M GLAD YOU'D LIKE IT SAIS WILDER CHUCKLING BENIGNENTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_984	I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JUELS
Line_985	WHATEVER LORD CHELFEORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
Line_986	HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKE'S SHOULDER
Line_987	BUT HER GREEDING TO CAPTAIN LEAK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUTY AND FROSEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIYED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
Line_988	HE IS NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
Line_989	AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALELLEGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLIGY AMUSEMENT
Line_990	WHERE UPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
Line_991	THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
Line_992	THE MYSTORY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPPASSITY FOR EVALVING LATENT FACOLTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SERVIVE THE HERS AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH MILIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOME HOW IN MY MIND WITH THE SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DESTINCT FROM HUMAN AND SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
Line_993	IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
Line_994	THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHIUL AT LAST SAID
Line_995	THE SOMBER OLD TREES LIKE JIGANTIC HURSE PLOOMS BLACK AND AWFUL
Line_996	MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONALBLY COMFTERABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
Line_997	THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOWS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MODELED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
Line_998	A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
Line_999	ALL THE FURNATURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
Line_1000	IF A FELLOW HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BEELS ABOVE AT ONCE
Line_1001	SOME HOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
Line_1002	BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISCUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
Line_1003	MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRAGE TO NIGHT
Line_1004	MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU Y AND TOO DEEP
Line_1005	WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Line_1006	BRACKTIN S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
Line_1007	DON'T INSULT ME STANDLY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
Line_1008	I DON'T KNOW ONE CANT SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMAN DEFIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMAIL I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LITS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
Line_1009	BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FULLISHLY
Line_1010	TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSABLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FIUDS
Line_1011	AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTORY
Line_1012	I AM VERY UN EASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CANT HELP IT
Line_1013	AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIPP OF HIS KAIN TOWARDS BRANDIN HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_1014	NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
Line_1015	I SHA'N'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GOSTORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
Line_1016	OF LITTLE BITT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
Line_1017	I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUSSION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
Line_1018	YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
Line_1019	ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FAITED TAPISTRY
Line_1020	I BOLDLY LITED MY TERUT
Line_1021	WELL YOU KNOW RADY WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACKTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORKIS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
Line_1022	THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
Line_1023	IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CAN NOT GET OVER DEAR DORKIS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
Line_1024	AND SHE THROUGW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE REACHUEL AT LAST BIRSTD INTO TEARS
Line_1025	AND THE WANE ORICLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORKIS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSEN'S EYES
Line_1026	SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
Line_1027	YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RATCUAL HURRIDLY LOOKING FROUWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWORLING IN HER FINGERS
Line_1028	POOR RACUAL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEET AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TROUTH AS SHE DARED
Line_1029	SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSLING OF FEMININ DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF BULCOME
Line_1030	IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PASS ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMEND'S FARM
Line_1031	WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
Line_1032	YES RACIEL I DO LOVE YOU
Line_1033	WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEAN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALLIS
Line_1034	YOU RESEMBLE ME RACHIEAL YOU ARE FEARLESS AND INFLEXIABLE AND GENEROUS
Line_1035	OF MARK WILDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISS ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT HIM
Line_1036	CHELFORD HAD A NOT FROM MISTER WILDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER KNOAT HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO WAS ABROAUD CONTINUED DORKAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
Line_1037	BUT POORE RACUL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOWICAL HIPOCRESY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
Line_1038	THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RATUAL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREEDING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMERSELF
Line_1039	DORKIS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
Line_1040	THANK YOU RACHIEL MY COUSIN RACHIEL MY ONLY FRIEND
Line_1041	YES SAID RACHEL
Line_1042	YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACHUAL
Line_1043	THIS TRANSIAT SPRING AND LITING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMAR BEGILING OUR SENSES
Line_1044	ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
Line_1045	I LIKE YOU STILL RACUL I'M SURE I'LL ALWAYS LIKE YOU
Line_1046	I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
Line_1047	THANK YOU DOARKAS DEAR
Line_1048	RATCIUEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EY STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
Line_1049	THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EADIFIS IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LADIS WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUDTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
Line_1050	LITTLE PERL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTESPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREST PLAT
Line_1051	THERE WERE A FEW ROSEBUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDENTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST CETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MITHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNELS SEETED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
Line_1052	AT THAT EPPICK OF PCRISTEEN SIYMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLITER PUBLIC INTREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSICA WATE THAN THE WELFAIRE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATERS AND ACTS OF STATE
Line_1053	LIFTING THE IERN HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTEL HESTER PRIN GAVE A SUMMENE WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
Line_1054	IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABOLISTIC FIGURES AND DIEGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCO WHEN NEWLY LADE ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOORIBLE FOR THE ADMIERATION OF AFTER TIMES
Line_1055	ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
Line_1056	WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMET AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNER BELLINGHAM HAD PLANED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRISTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
Line_1057	PERL SEING THE ROSEBUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
Line_1058	WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PIRLS RICH AND LUXORIENT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHOWN WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSESSING INTENCITY BOTH OF DEAPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY ACKIN TO BLACK
Line_1059	THE PERIAD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLYER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DESPUT CONSERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FEARSE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLINY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
Line_1060	IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
Line_1061	SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUBTED TO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGEATIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
Line_1062	THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMENY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THI SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY OURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALEIGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLIM OF HER GILT AND TORTURE
Line_1063	PERL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMETORE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBERY
Line_1064	MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
Line_1065	HESTERPRIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNER BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMAR ROULLER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND IMFLOENCIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRASY
Line_1066	ON THE TABLE IN TOKENE THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTER TANKERED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PERL PEAPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNENT OF A RECENT DRAFT OF AL
Line_1067	BUT PERRL WHO WAS A DAUGNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROUNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING JESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE NOD OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
Line_1068	YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIEP NOW
Line_1069	IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
Line_1070	YAY HIS HONOURABLE WORSHEOP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEACH
Line_1071	COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM
Line_1072	BUT THE PROPRIETER APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELENQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTANCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
Line_1073	BUT IN TRUTH PERL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
Line_1074	HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS WONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ARING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SIVERITY
Line_1075	HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGELLY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIAD WHILE PERL WAS EMBIBING HER SOULL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAIME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EIRTH
Line_1076	IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MELITIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PERL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
Line_1077	MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISS FORTUOUONS SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO EMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROLE OVER THE INFINT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
Line_1078	BRUDING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED THE SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONGJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSABLE INTELIGENCE
Line_1079	THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
Line_1080	IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
Line_1081	HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELIGEANCE THAT THROUW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
Line_1082	THEY WERE NOW ELUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTANCE MIGHT BE PROLIFHIC OF THE STORM AND WORLWIND
Line_1083	PERRL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFENTILE WORLD
Line_1084	BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PERSUE THE LITTLE ELPH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOOSM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PERL WAS FLESH AN BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
Line_1085	GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISSHONNOURED BOOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOL IN HEAVEN
Line_1086	PERLE SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTENCE
Line_1087	AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISSEPPLIN WHETHER ADDRESS TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PURL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDENCE WITH THE CAPPRIECE THAT ROULLED THE MOMENT
Line_1088	THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FALTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
Line_1089	YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRIN LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
Line_1090	THE GOOD NATURED ORDIENCE IN PITTY TO FALLAN MAGISTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE SAM WHICH THE FORMAR HAD CALLED FOR
Line_1091	OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
Line_1092	HIS DEATH IN THIS CONGUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISS FORTOUON
Line_1093	THE PARLAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
Line_1094	THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREETY WITH THE KING
Line_1095	IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANKER AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLIMATIONS AND WITH PRAIRS FOR HIS SAFETY
Line_1096	AND THE MEN OF ISRIL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDA AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
Line_1097	BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATTABLE THAT SKEAM WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
Line_1098	THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SAM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
Line_1099	THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISTIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAIDE HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GARD UPON HIM UNDER COLLAR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
Line_1100	ANOTHER PCREATURE AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISS GOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS SAM TO BE SOUNG
Line_1101	THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSUORED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOOME THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS

Line_1105	HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
Line_1106	VALLER INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DEFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISSIPPLIN ALSO WAS OBTAINED BY THE FORSES OF THE PARLIMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONSERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
Line_1107	BY QUICK MARCHERS T THROUGH THESE INEXCESSIABLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORSES OF THE COVENENTRS
Line_1108	HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORENCE AND IN EXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALLER AND FORTUON CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
Line_1109	FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENENTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROAIAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASCEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
Line_1110	FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICSORS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDIPENDENTS COULD RELYE ON

Line_1114	THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUE SELIBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SCURMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
Line_1115	THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURREGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTINENCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSTD ROIALISTS
Line_1116	WHILE THE FORMAR FOR TOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVINANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A YOUNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLAMENT AND INCALCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED

Line_1119	THIS SIVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLYED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTON AS MUCH AS OF SEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE OUR GILE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INTERLOCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM

Line_1226	YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALEAY

Line_1231	THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A CUADREAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENSEMENT OF THE DANCE

Line_1235	DISTAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAM SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
Line_1236	YOUR MAGESTYE'S PLAN THEN AN THIS AFFAIR IS
Line_1237	THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE REPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VERIETY OF COKETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
Line_1238	YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
Line_1239	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBER HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AUCARANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO CARTIERS
Line_1240	BUT IN THIS VINET COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALS BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
Line_1241	HE KNOWS THEM BOTH
Line_1242	BUT NOW HERE IS THE SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNAR DRUW IT AT ALL
Line_1243	THE BROWN GROWN BENIEETH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TUTCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TUTCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
Line_1244	THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONS THEIR FAVERAT CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING ITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
Line_1245	IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
Line_1246	MY FIRST IMPRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY INFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HEW SIDE BY SIDE
Line_1247	SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMING FOR HIS INTANGLED CKIGHT
Line_1248	EXCQUISIT ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITTERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAISER IN HIS TENDER MOOD IND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
Line_1249	BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
Line_1250	EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
Line_1251	ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FIRE
Line_1252	THUS IN CHASER'S DREAME
Line_1253	THEY UNIGHT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS KEARISCURISTS
Line_1254	NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUEWS IT BECOMES SOME HOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PERLLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREETED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIMANDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JULS IF THEY ARE GRIDATED JUSTLY
Line_1255	IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILITY OF TEMPOR AND PILISCITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE PFILISCITY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
Line_1256	EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLEGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUAL WORK OF WHOLBINE OR DURE
Line_1257	THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
Line_1258	IT IS THE HEAD OF A PEARET WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIOS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
Line_1259	WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNERS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGIEST CLASS AND YOU DEFIND HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STIRNEST INTILECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPEMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1260	BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURASCURIST DEIVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORSE AND ONE THING UN SEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
Line_1261	NOW HERE IS RAFIEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAFE BY LEAFE WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
Line_1262	IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHAT SOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESKNESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
Line_1263	YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVALVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1264	HERE IS AN EQUALLY TIPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLLOR WHAT SOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELEUSS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APPOLLOW IND THE PITHOINE
Line_1265	YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITTION HOLBINE TURNER AND TINCARET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
Line_1266	THIS AT ONCE COMPELLES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JULER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
Line_1267	DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
Line_1268	IN ALL ERTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILLIAR OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DESTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDED REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
Line_1269	THAT A STILE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVIERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERONIOUS
Line_1270	FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLAT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEASING ON THE MANIFUL DELITIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEASED BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANIOUS TUTCH
Line_1271	IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLLORATLIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLLER AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
Line_1272	IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINED BY EDWARD BURN JONS IN ILISTRATION OF THE STORY OF SIKY IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF SIKY AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
Line_1273	YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONKER HIM WITH WHAT SKAVE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
Line_1274	SOME OF THE TUTCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAIDE IN LITTLE DROPS OR POAUNDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRISTALYZE HARD AT THE EDGE
Line_1275	IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SUROUNDING NATURE THOSE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
Line_1276	THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINES INDEED ENTIRELY FEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
Line_1277	IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KIGHTS FLY FOLCOINS WHO INSTEAD OF OBAYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPARD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GEARIEAGAL
Line_1278	NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
Line_1279	THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELIMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
Line_1280	THE COLORIST SAIYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELITIOUS PEROCAYE WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIME AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLADED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
Line_1281	THE SEEN IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
Line_1282	THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
Line_1283	IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATERMILL ITS SELF MASSY AND RENT SCARSELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONS TO TURN
Line_1284	THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
Line_1285	IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SITE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYES EVER LUARN
Line_1286	I'M SURE ALEXANDR HOPES YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
Line_1287	YES DON'T YOU
Line_1288	AND ANY HOW THERE'S NOTHING TOO UNDERSTAND
Line_1289	THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER

Line_1300	MARISE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER KNECK AND HAIR
Line_1301	MARIEY'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BRUDING GAZE
Line_1302	IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
Line_1303	SHERLY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
Line_1304	I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO

Line_1307	OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAY AND SCHOOL TEACHERY
Line_1308	I GET TIRED OF SEEING MAN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
Line_1309	THE ORCURD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
Line_1310	THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
Line_1311	I CANT PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMBED FOR IT
Line_1312	HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
Line_1313	FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORSE CASE THE ANGURIER HE GROUE
Line_1314	SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THROUGH OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
Line_1315	BUT AMIL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
Line_1316	THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY YUSED TO
Line_1317	AND HE NEVER YOUSED TO BE CROSS TO ME
Line_1318	MARIS SIGED
Line_1319	I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARISE
Line_1320	AND AIMIL MOED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
Line_1321	I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDENS ARE
Line_1322	HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPIED FRUIT LONG IVERY COLLERED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORREL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEATED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
Line_1323	IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARAL
Line_1324	I LIKE TO TALK TO CARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
Line_1325	WHEN SHE YUSED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T ALITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
Line_1326	I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
Line_1327	I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASEN TOO THEN
Line_1328	THEY THINK YOU ARE PROUD BECAUSE YOU AVE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING

Line_1551	SILVHIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERRIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THIATRICAL SISTERS ALL THOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE

Line_1562	YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOUR
Line_1563	HE HIMSELF RECIDED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLIHTLY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
Line_1564	THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAIS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FORRONER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ETTALLIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT THE CITY OF THE THIEATERS AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERY WHEARE
Line_1565	HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIE I HAVE IT SIR
Line_1566	SILVIA WAS THE ADDERATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMITIES WHICH THE GREATEST OTHERS ROAT FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAS OF MARRIVOE FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMITIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSPERITY

Line_1568	HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE CEPT ALLTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
Line_1569	MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNSIATION OF THE WORD SKEVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCIOURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
Line_1570	LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROUD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICLT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROUD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE

Line_1572	MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT RIGHTER
Line_1573	IS THERE NOT A MARIDIAN EVERYWHERE
Line_1574	BUT TO HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASIONABLE
Line_1575	YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SILVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRRICL YOU MAY CONSOLL YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POORE SILVIA DIES
Line_1576	WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ELUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
Line_1577	SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFGFH BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARRIS
Line_1578	I ADDRESS HIM AN ATTALLIAN AND HE ANSWERES VERY WITTILLY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
Line_1579	LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TWO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADDING DESPARATLY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVER HANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEADS WHERE THE DREADFUL Y OF THE HALK SHOULD NOT DESERN HIM
Line_1580	BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PERSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOME MOLDDOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
Line_1581	THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND UPHALLING
Line_1582	THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRRIDECENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTEROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SITES FINELY PENCLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREST OF RICH CHESTNOT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
Line_1583	THE HALK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENETH THE SURFACE
Line_1584	AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
Line_1585	ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMELT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLLER SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
Line_1586	IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUTS TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFALD HALK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
Line_1587	HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT READ
Line_1588	WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
Line_1589	AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALLENES WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGATIVES HEAD
Line_1590	IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANCIAL MEAL
Line_1591	THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT COUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HALK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
Line_1592	BUT THIS FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALLER WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOME OF THESE MADE RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
Line_1593	THE HALK ALLIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
Line_1594	THE HALK IMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGED IN PERSUT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR AVAITED OR DECEIVED
Line_1595	BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARIED WITH THE OLS HOOKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
Line_1596	BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEANNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLOOKES OF HIS INGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FEARSE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEARING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
Line_1597	THE GREAT HUCK FOLLOWED HERRIDLY TO RETREVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
Line_1598	BUT SUDDENLY STRAIT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMERENT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORENT AND DISAPPEARED BENIETH THE SURFACE
Line_1599	THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWLS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
Line_1600	THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
Line_1601	BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
Line_1602	ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP
Line_1603	STRAIT WAY THE HOCK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
Line_1604	ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WEALED AND MADE BACK HURRIDLY FOR HIS PERCH
Line_1605	IN DISPAIRE HE HERLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
Line_1606	HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATCIANT TO DROP HIS FLIS AGAIN ON THE SPOT WERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
Line_1607	THE DUTCHES OF SOUTH BRIDGE TO LORD REDGEY OH REDGEY WHAT DID YOU SAY

Line_1614	IN THE OLD BADLY MAIDE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERIS TO TAKE THE OUDIENCE INTO HIS COMPFIDENCE
Line_1615	THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF

Line_1852	HENCE THE EATISON ELECTROLITIC MEATER IS NO LONGER YUSED DESPIGHT ITS EXOLENT QUALITIES
Line_1853	THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT I WILL CHANGE
Line_1854	THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTRALITIC MEATER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRISITY TO DECOMPOSE A CEMICAL SUBSTANCE
Line_1855	THE LUNDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMINENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEUER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELLS CHERCHES STOORS AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADOCK
Line_1856	EVERY THING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
Line_1857	BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSCURTS A REMOT COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELLIMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
Line_1858	EDISON HAD ENSTOLLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GRAT CENTRAL STATION SISTOM IN NE YORK ON THE MOLTIABLE ARK SISTOM COVERED BY HIS FEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST THE STRAT TWO WIRES SISTOM THROUGH OUT OF THE TRE KIND
Line_1859	THERE MASSIERS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDERED IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH YOUSEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
Line_1860	BROAUD AS THE PRERRIES AND FREAN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS ITIOSENCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GAPEE
Line_1861	HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JAB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
Line_1862	I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRICIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISIPLIN OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
Line_1863	ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPERATIS WERE VERIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILES AND REFINMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACURASY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFTIVE CURRENT OR DAMIGE
Line_1864	THE DINAMO ELECTRIC MASHEN THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VECISITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE YUSE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
Line_1865	IT COULD NOT BE YUSED FOR ELECTRA PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
Line_1866	THE STANDERD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE SELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE MEETER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
Line_1867	THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SISTOM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPATITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SISTOM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETIS TO INCANDESSANT LIGHTING
Line_1868	THE ARKLAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A COUSTOMORS PREMISSES OR IN A SIRKET FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY OURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR OURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
Line_1869	FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT SIRCKETS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN ERGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
Line_1870	HE SOON FOR SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECCONEMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
Line_1871	EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOPE A MEATER
Line_1872	THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBEROCATE AN ENGIAN FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDESON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARIN ENGIAN STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGIAN FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
Line_1873	THEY WERE LATER YUSED AS RESERVED MASHIEENS AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGIAN RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ETISONIA BUT THEY REMAINE IN PRACTICALLY IS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN ENSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
Line_1874	MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WARS SISTOM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPCENSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPCENSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDIPENDENT INVENTERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
Line_1875	IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSEBOWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRADULATION
Line_1876	THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTOLLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIPE CENTRAL STATIONS
Line_1877	WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PIGT
Line_1878	HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATER OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATER TO VERIFY IT
Line_1879	THE PROBLAM WAS SOVED
Line_1880	WE HAD MEATERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
Line_1881	THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE SENTURY
Line_1882	OWING TO HIS INSISTANCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENCELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROPHITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OFE AS AN APPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
Line_1883	IN DICEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUW J JENXS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEARS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THAND MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
Line_1884	THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFENATE RESULTS ALL THOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BACIS
Line_1885	IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ELUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADDOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON MEATER WAS ACURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVERYABLY SECURED IN THE STATION SELLING CURRENT BY MEATER
Line_1886	MISTER ATISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
Line_1887	EDISON WAS INTOLORENT OF SHAM AND SHE AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICRISCOPE TASTOBE AND GALVENOMENER
Line_1888	THERE WAS INFINATE SCEPTISISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTERS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGABLE AS ELECTRISITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WAD AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
Line_1889	BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
Line_1890	HE WAYED AND REWAIYED THE MEATER PLATS AND PERSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAINE
Line_1891	UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGIAN OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNAND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DINAMO AND LAMP ETISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
Line_1892	WHY IF WE EARRECT THE STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONAMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
Line_1893	THE PARRIS PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE CRISTAL PALLIS WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
Line_1894	THERE IT CLOTHESD ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN MEDFOR RAGS

Line_1900	NOW WHEN HAS HORRER EVER EXCLUDED STUDDY
Line_1901	NOTHING IS MORE LAGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWOARMING OF SLANG
Line_1902	HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOEGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGWEGE A PHILOSOFER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
Line_1903	DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
Line_1904	AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFERMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMITIY IS NOT A BUIUSNESS IN WHICH CHOICES PERMITED

Line_2052	PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FORRIST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
Line_2053	HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
Line_2054	IN THE COURT YARDS SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CRISMESS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
Line_2055	THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHOWN ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GRO MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADS PINES AS WELL AS FIRS
Line_2056	WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
Line_2057	AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
Line_2058	THOUGHT THE FIRTREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL
Line_2059	REJOICE IN THY GROTH SAID THE SUN BEAMS
Line_2060	NO SAID THE TREE

Line_2063	IN AUTUM THE WOOD COUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLD SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
Line_2064	IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEADS AND NETTLES
Line_2065	AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN
Line_2066	BUT THEY DRAGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STARS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
Line_2067	A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
Line_2068	THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
Line_2069	HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SON AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERIES
Line_2070	CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
Line_2071	TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TWO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND HEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
Line_2072	WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE

Line_2083	OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIRTREY
Line_2084	I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE
Line_2085	THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDEDLY UNDER THE LARGE BRUING COPPER AND ITS SIDES SO DEAPLY
Line_2086	THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLET AND SPLENDED THE TEMPIST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLOUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERY WHEARE

Line_2136	MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
Line_2137	WHILE CHEIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
Line_2138	I HAD SCEARSELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
Line_2139	IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLLERED
Line_2140	IT DID NOT BEKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
Line_2141	ONWARD SAID A DISTANT VOICE
Line_2142	I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
Line_2143	I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
Line_2144	I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAFFAR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HEURLD HIM FROM ME
Line_2145	NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUEDGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOME HOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
Line_2146	A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
Line_2147	MY TUNG REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEACH LAUGHET ME
Line_2148	NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RISK TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
Line_2149	NO SOUND BROKE THI STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT

Line_2158	THE STORY OF ITS EVEL INFLOUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TROUOTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
Line_2159	I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE FANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY APPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CAFAR

Line_2163	WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DESTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
Line_2164	PRESCRIBED BY THE SIVL AND ECLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONETISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY INNMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOUPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE GERISTICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
Line_2165	THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXALTATION THAT THE APPISTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF YOUROUP AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CANTAGION OF GILT AND SKISUM AND THAT THE POROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHERCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VILETE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISEPLIN
Line_2166	BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVELEGE WAS SOON VIELATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TROUTH THE EMPR EMBIBED THE MACXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHERCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPTH OF CRISTIANITY
Line_2167	CONSTANTEEN EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DESPUT HIS OPPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GILTY OF THE MOST OBSIRD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SIVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
Line_2168	THE GRATEFUL APPLAUS OF THE CLERGIY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO ENDOULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTREST
Line_2169	THE EDICT OF MELLAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLORATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDGUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVELAGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
Line_2170	SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIECLEIETION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF APPRESSION AND PLEEDED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
Line_2171	BISSHOUPS VERGIANS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFENTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENNENTS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNIAN OF THE DOMETISTS
Line_2172	A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLLARS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SOED TOGETHER
Line_2173	AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNSHCONS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILECONS THE PATH DIVIDED
Line_2174	I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGALOUGHT LAUGGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICLT TO EXPLAIN
Line_2175	OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
Line_2176	I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOMED TO MY HOME
Line_2177	HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN ANT A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
Line_2178	WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
Line_2179	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAJITION WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
Line_2180	NO ONE WOULD DESTERBE THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FORRIST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
Line_2181	THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
Line_2182	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAIZY QUIELT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLLARS ARE SO MIXED UP
Line_2183	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AS IN WHICH THEY LIVED
Line_2184	AND YOU MUST BE O JO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
Line_2185	AT THE EMRALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OUSMA LIVES GREAN IS THE POPULAR COLLAR
Line_2186	AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR CETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RAT
Line_2187	UNK KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL L IM BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITERS WITH A SMILE
Line_2188	I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL COUBERD AND THROUGW OPEN THE DOORS
Line_2189	YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
Line_2190	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AIHT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNSHKEEN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
Line_2191	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUTTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLLERS WOULD DISCOURRAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHEKONS ARE
Line_2192	BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSE WORK AND TO COKE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DITSHES
Line_2193	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POUDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGALOUT WHO WANTS TO YUSE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
Line_2194	HE WARE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE NEAPANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WASTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRATED WITH GOLD
Line_2195	INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WARE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE COUFTS OF GOLD BRAD
Line_2196	I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF ARS
Line_2197	THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
Line_2198	I THINK THE NEXT CLASS CAT THE MAJITION MAKES WILL HAVE NITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
Line_2199	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
Line_2200	YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNK NUNKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
Line_2201	THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
Line_2202	YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALOUT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEETED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEET THAT MY HUSBAND FULLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POUDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBY THE WITCH WHO YOUSED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLOCONS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
Line_2203	WHEN THEY WERE OUT SIDE UNK SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
Line_2204	WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPP AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
Line_2205	WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALOUGHT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SUORE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
Line_2206	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POUDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLS
Line_2207	OJO BECAME A BIT UN EASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POUDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFEAR AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CAN NOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
Line_2208	GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEADDLE IN THE LAND OF AUS AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
Line_2209	THE WISERD OF AS WHO YOUSET TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WISERD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORSORIS
Line_2210	MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
Line_2211	DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOXS YOURE GETTING TO BE UNK REMARKED THE MAJITION WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
Line_2212	SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
Line_2213	IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAJITION
Line_2214	THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEATE BRAIDES
Line_2215	I NOW USED THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
Line_2216	OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVEANCE WITH WONDER
Line_2217	SHE PORED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
Line_2218	MARGALDE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK'S SCERT AND AN APREN WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
Line_2219	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAJITION REMOVED THIS POUDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
Line_2220	I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITERS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEMB AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
Line_2221	NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
Line_2222	ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
Line_2223	THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWOARK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
Line_2224	I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEADED IN A SERVANT
Line_2225	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POUDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE COUBEARD
Line_2226	THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH CETTL A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POUDER
Line_2227	LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ONGOLATIONS
Line_2228	WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LOUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
Line_2229	IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GOLLATIONS AND ROARE PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
Line_2230	A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE OREGIEN OF LUTHOR'S COMMENTARY UNGULATIONS
Line_2231	IT WAS RITTEN IN LATIN
Line_2232	THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMES SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICLT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
Line_2233	BUT THE ESSENCE OF LOUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
Line_2234	THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENCED
Line_2235	THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LOUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOUWILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LOUTHERIN CHERCH ACTUALLY TO REED LOUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
Line_2236	THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
Line_2237	MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATAIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD RE PUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRIN MYGOLATIONS FOR INSTANCE MEN
Line_2238	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOK TOO
Line_2239	IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S RIGHTINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CRICSET MERRITS ALONE
Line_2240	BY HIS RESERECTION CRIST WORNE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEAVELE DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVEL
Line_2241	THAT CRICET IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PALL ESCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DESPENDSE GRACE AND PEACE
Line_2242	OTHERWISE PALL SHOULD HAVE RITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD GESAS CRIST
Line_2243	PALL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
Line_2244	PALL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED GESAS CRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2245	ALL THOUGH THE BRETHERIN WITH ME ARE NOT APPOSSCLS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
Line_2246	WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERRIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
Line_2247	NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PACIAL LAMS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
Line_2248	THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTH S OF THE FALSE APPOSSELS
Line_2249	INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHERCH OF CRIST FOR A LONG TIME
Line_2250	NOT ALL THE GOLATIONS HAD BECOME PRIVERTED
Line_2251	THE GREEDING OF THE APPOSCAL IS REFRESHION
Line_2252	NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
Line_2253	AGAINST THESE BOSTING FALSE APPOSSLS PALL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APPISTOLIC ATHORITY AND MINISTRY
Line_2254	THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2255	AT THE SAME TIME PALLE CONFIRMES OUR CREED THAT CRICST IS VERY GOD
Line_2256	THEY REMAINE DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
Line_2257	THESE PREVERTERS OF THE RIGCHIOUSNESS OF CRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
Line_2258	AS THE AMBACITER OF A GOVERMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRISTE SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN ATHORETY AMONG MEN
Line_2259	AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RACED HIM FROM THE DEAD
Line_2260	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGIELS CAN NOT
Line_2261	I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
Line_2262	HE NEVER LOOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS APPISTAL
Line_2263	DID NOT CRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
Line_2264	WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
Line_2265	PALE CAME LATER IN HIS BENIETH US
Line_2266	BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LITE OF SIN
Line_2267	THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRID
Line_2268	THEY SAID TO THE GOLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PALL
Line_2269	WE ARE TO HEAR CRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
Line_2270	THE ARIANS TOOK CRICE FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGIELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND ERTH
Line_2271	HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISTION OF OUR SINS
Line_2272	ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DISPARE
Line_2273	DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERIN HERITICS WOULD DIS OWN HIS ENTIRE CHERCH
Line_2274	MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
Line_2275	THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PALL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
Line_2276	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PALL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
Line_2277	THE GREATNESS OF THE RANDSOME CRICET THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
Line_2278	AND ALL THE BRETHERIN WHICH ARE WITH ME
Line_2279	SO MUCH FOR THE TITELE OF THE APPISTAL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREEDING OF THE APPOSSAL VIERSE THREE
Line_2280	WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE WHOLLY CHERCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICRIST RAINS THERE
Line_2281	PALL STICKS TO HIS THEM
Line_2282	IMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
Line_2283	BUT THE REAL SGNIFICENCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
Line_2284	IN THIS WHOLE APPISSEL PALL TREETS OF THE RESERECTION OF CRIST
Line_2285	PALL AND APPOSSL NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
Line_2286	THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPLE PRODOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CRISTIANS ARE
Line_2287	I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRIN OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOFASTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOSTING
Line_2288	IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDER MINE THE ATTHORITY OF SAINT PALL
Line_2289	GRACE ENVALVES THE REMITTION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
Line_2290	THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD AN DR SIN
Line_2291	TO DO SO IS TO LOOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLORABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS IMFINATE MAGISTY
Line_2292	WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APPART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
Line_2293	THIS ATITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
Line_2294	HE MENTIONED THE APPOSSALS FIRST BECAUSE HEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
Line_2295	WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRIN TO GODLESS PRINCES BUISHOUPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
Line_2296	UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SOR CONSCIENCES
Line_2297	HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUSIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTON UPON HIM
Line_2298	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAME IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
Line_2299	THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
Line_2300	EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
Line_2301	MAHOMEAT ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CRISET
Line_2302	FOR A PERSON TO POSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
Line_2303	SINCE CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CAN NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
Line_2304	THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKING CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
Line_2305	EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGIENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSSALS
Line_2306	THE WORLD BRANS THIS A PRENICIOUS DOCTRIN
Line_2307	IT SPOILES ONE'S BEST WORK
Line_2308	HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIEACE OF GOD WILL
Line_2309	VERS TO
Line_2310	THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LITLY
Line_2311	THE CLASS SEEMED SUPERFOLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
Line_2312	GRACE BE TO YOU IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD GESAS CRIST
Line_2313	PALL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APPOSSALS WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MAN NOR BY MAN
Line_2314	HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CRISTE
Line_2315	WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
Line_2316	THESE MEANS CAN NOT BE CONTEMINATED
Line_2317	PARTLY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
Line_2318	HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAY
Line_2319	I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MALLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKARY
Line_2320	ALIXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
Line_2321	IT'S REARLLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
Line_2322	THERE ARE FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD CORTER
Line_2323	THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GAVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
Line_2324	THERE WAS WATERCRESST SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMLET STUFFED WITH MUSHROMS AND TROUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ART CHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
Line_2325	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PARRIS
Line_2326	THERE JUST IN FRONT
Line_2327	I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
Line_2328	THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOIEAL EVEN MAIN HALL
Line_2329	THEY ARE ALL SCETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLADESTAY YOU SEE
Line_2330	HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLACKS AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABIES AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECCLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BANDAMAIR
Line_2331	I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMEURLY
Line_2332	FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLY SPOKE
Line_2333	HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA
Line_2334	WHEN PARTLY ARRIVED AT BEDFORT SQUAIR ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIS THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STARS
Line_2335	COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEY IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE
Line_2336	HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
Line_2337	ALEXANDER CLENCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
Line_2338	IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHERS
Line_2339	PARTLY LEENED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TUTCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
Line_2340	WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVARY
Line_2341	LAM WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEEL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
Line_2342	HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARRIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS
Line_2343	DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID HER SON TURN OUT
Line_2344	THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEY AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
Line_2345	THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS
Line_2346	THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS SO JOLLY
Line_2347	IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEY
Line_2348	HE FELT A TREMMAR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
Line_2349	THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
Line_2350	NONSENCE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
Line_2351	WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NORE OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
Line_2352	HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVASLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
Line_2353	I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COUSON MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
Line_2354	I UNDERSTAND BARTLY I WAS RONG
Line_2355	I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
Line_2356	PARTLY BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE
Line_2357	SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSETE SIDE OF THE HARTH HER NEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGPHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
Line_2358	DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
Line_2359	HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
Line_2360	SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
Line_2361	WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
Line_2362	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_2363	THE STOPP AT QUEENS TOWN THE TEEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSY WERE THINGS THAT HE KNOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIANCE
Line_2364	IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
Line_2365	HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
Line_2366	HE TOOK HER ROUFFHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
Line_2367	I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
Line_2368	THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USE TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
Line_2369	KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FOLLOWED YOU
Line_2370	WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISS NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG
Line_2371	BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBARIABLE
Line_2372	ALEXANDER PASED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTENING AND UNBUTTENING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
Line_2373	THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
Line_2374	HE MOVED UN EASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED
Line_2375	I THOUHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSON MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
Line_2376	WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
Line_2377	BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
Line_2378	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
Line_2379	SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPOLT IN LEACH
Line_2380	WORNT YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
Line_2381	HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM THE CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARSELY BREETHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES IT
Line_2382	ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW I'M COWERDLY
Line_2383	I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
Line_2384	ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN
Line_2385	YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
Line_2386	PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
Line_2387	SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STARS
Line_2388	YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
Line_2389	I CANT STAND SEEING YOU MISEURIBLE
Line_2390	HO BARTLY WHAT AM I TO DO
Line_2391	I FELT IT IN MY BONS WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDED WAS GOING TO TURN UP
Line_2392	BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
Line_2393	I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2394	AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_2395	YES HELDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
Line_2396	ALEXANDER GROWNED I MEANT TO BUT SOME HOW I COULDN'T
Line_2397	I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TOO BARTLY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
Line_2398	ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
Line_2399	BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
Line_2400	SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
Line_2401	AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
Line_2402	IREN BERGOIN ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
Line_2403	SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEIATER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE YUSED TO
Line_2404	MAIN HALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEAR
Line_2405	YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIN CONSCIOUS TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
Line_2406	WESTMAIR AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
Line_2407	IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF ADOUSAN TIMES ALREADY
Line_2408	SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
Line_2409	I'ME GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
Line_2410	MAIN HALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTYINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
Line_2411	HE WAS BEGINING TO FEEL A KEAN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BEAR FOOT DONKY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
Line_2412	SIR HARRY TOWN MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEAR
Line_2413	HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEAN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
Line_2414	HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
Line_2415	A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
Line_2416	ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINTEFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAUD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM

Line_2541	FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAIDE SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAISE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITER
Line_2542	LOUWIES HOPED FOR EXOLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
Line_2543	UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENELDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE CAMITTY PROPOSED TO SACREFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPCKINS
Line_2544	THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
Line_2545	HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAIDE'S HANDS
Line_2546	FATE THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND II CANT BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
Line_2547	SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
Line_2548	HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDIPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BREAD COMPOSURE AND CALM RELYIENCE
Line_2549	THE DEMOCRATIC COMITTY FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
Line_2550	TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANCIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
Line_2551	ONE OF MISTER HOPCIN'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HINCHMAN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
Line_2552	SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDES AT ELMHERST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRIEN AND CAP
Line_2553	THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHERST AND THE ONLY WEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE ENVITED GUESS
Line_2554	ALIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEE CLICKED IN THE LOCK
Line_2555	THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESORSES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAX TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESS
Line_2556	BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED THE GIRL
Line_2557	THE HOUSEKEEPER LEAD THE WAY AND BATH FOLLOWED
Line_2558	SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JAINE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVERET
Line_2559	ALIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
Line_2560	SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMITTY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPCINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORDES AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EAQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLERS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
Line_2561	FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAIDE REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
Line_2562	THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NOW MISS BETH I AM ELIZABETH PARSONS
Line_2563	WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
Line_2564	THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH RENEOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
Line_2565	SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROALKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
Line_2566	I WAS BICK KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORCHE THE SIGNATURE
Line_2567	FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN ACLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL
Line_2568	THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKM WHO WAS THE JAILER
Line_2569	I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARCIEL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR

Line_2575	WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
Line_2576	HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PASED UP AND DOWN THE NEAROW SELL IN FRONT OF THEM
Line_2577	I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARCIEL
Line_2578	AS REGARDS MY ROBING THE COMPANY ILL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
Line_2579	THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSMENT ON HIS SHRUID FACE
Line_2580	I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARCIAL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
Line_2581	THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILEAR ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
Line_2582	A FRESH HOLSOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GREY EYES AN INTELIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A CENCTIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
Line_2583	HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPASITION THAT WOULD ENDEVER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
Line_2584	I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY
Line_2585	OLD WELL IS A FIN FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
Line_2586	GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORCH CHECK AND CUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
Line_2587	BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN ACCASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLOUFF
Line_2588	WORSE TAM WORSE THAN EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GRLOUMILY
Line_2589	BETH UN EASY AT A SILENCE NUDGED HIM
Line_2590	HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGHE CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE HAD BEEN SHARP
Line_2591	MISTER GRAFF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
Line_2592	SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMITT HER
Line_2593	AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPARE BY THE PAIMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLERS
Line_2594	YOURE FULLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO AL THIS
Line_2595	AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
Line_2596	HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COUST
Line_2597	I'ME NOT ELECTIANEARING JUST NOW
Line_2598	AND HE DESERVE SAP TERM IN STATES PRISON
Line_2599	KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENELTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
Line_2600	I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FULLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
Line_2601	I CANT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LOYER
Line_2602	IT HAS COUST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYENCE
Line_2603	HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITERS TOME
Line_2604	I'LL PAY ALL THE COUST BESIDES

Line_2607	I'M RUNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICON TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
Line_2608	SARY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROUM IN THE JAIL
Line_2609	IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITH DRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWD HIS FREEDOM
Line_2610	BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
Line_2611	HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONSERN
Line_2612	HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEETED
Line_2613	IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UN FEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TROUTH
Line_2614	MAY WE SEEN GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
Line_2615	THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
Line_2616	WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIN TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
Line_2617	SOMETIMES I'M THAT YURNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRASY AND I DON'TKNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
Line_2618	IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
Line_2619	THEN ROAGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN

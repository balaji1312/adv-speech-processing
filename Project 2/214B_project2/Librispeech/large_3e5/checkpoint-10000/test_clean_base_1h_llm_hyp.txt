Line_81	CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
Line_82	MISTER SAUMER'S WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWELMED BY THIS FLOUD OF INFORMATION
Line_83	HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DESTERBANCE OF THE QUIET RIETEEN OF HIS LIFE
Line_84	DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTERS
Line_85	SO IT SEEMS TO ME
Line_86	YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
Line_87	MY SCOLLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
Line_88	I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
Line_89	THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
Line_90	HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
Line_91	O I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY IS SIR
Line_92	ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DESSCREETLY
Line_93	I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE ROT WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISH SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
Line_94	HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT HOUSING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
Line_95	THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
Line_96	AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOLMS FOR IT ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
Line_97	ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A SAY
Line_98	I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO YOUSE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
Line_99	WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDYINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
Line_100	AS HOMS DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND AN ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGIENCY
Line_101	LET US HEAR THE SUSPITNIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
Line_102	THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPITION
Line_103	THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLET
Line_104	THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEARSED THE NEXT
Line_105	THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDES
Line_106	YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NOT SIR
Line_107	I WILL ENDEAVER IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONSERNED
Line_108	I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOMES
Line_109	BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
Line_110	HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETRECET VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
Line_111	I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
Line_112	A BROKEN TIPP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
Line_113	I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD ACCERRED
Line_114	THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEE IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
Line_115	MY FRIENDS TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
Line_116	I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
Line_117	I WAS ABSENT A RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
Line_118	TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
Line_119	NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BOWL OF BLACK DO OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
Line_120	NOW MISTER SOMS AT YOUR DISPOSAL
Line_121	HOMS TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLO WHAT IS THIS
Line_122	HOMS HAD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS
Line_123	ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
Line_124	AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR HIS EXAMINATION YES
Line_125	ANY ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
Line_126	ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
Line_127	I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
Line_128	I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
Line_129	ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPITION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFES
Line_130	WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTIOS THERE ARE OTHERS
Line_131	HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N EN AND THE SPACES OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
Line_132	DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
Line_133	THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANINED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
Line_134	WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
Line_135	THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MARLES MACLARIN
Line_136	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOWN
Line_137	TOMORROW AS THE EXAMINATION
Line_138	IT WOULD BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
Line_139	IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DELEMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE COLPRET TO COMPETE FOR THE VALIABLE SCOLLAERSHIP
Line_140	YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
Line_141	THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
Line_142	JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOMS
Line_143	HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
Line_144	I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
Line_145	HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WEAR WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
Line_146	HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILLECRIST
Line_147	MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FALLIOR BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
Line_148	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTIONS
Line_149	NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
Line_150	NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
Line_151	WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
Line_152	THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING LOVE
Line_153	HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS AND HIS OWN OFFICE
Line_154	LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HANDS

Line_156	I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDETABLE

Line_158	IF MISTER SOMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UPP
Line_159	I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
Line_160	NOW SIR CERTAINLY NOT
Line_161	WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
Line_162	WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
Line_163	ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PIRIMIDS OF BLACK DOOEY CLAY
Line_164	NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOMS AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCRITS DOOR
Line_165	IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SIYLOETE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
Line_166	HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
Line_167	HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
Line_168	THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOMES
Line_169	IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARCIEL
Line_170	WHY BANISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTERS

Line_183	HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME

Line_275	THE STORIES RITTEN
Line_276	MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
Line_277	YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
Line_278	IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
Line_279	SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAV BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER

Line_282	THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TUTCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
Line_283	SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
Line_284	HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROFIES OF THE CHACE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSIXS THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
Line_285	IT SOUNDED DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS S
Line_286	IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DUGLISS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
Line_287	CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
Line_288	THE FIRST OF THESE TUTCHES CONVAID THAT THE RITTBEIN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
Line_289	LET ME SAY HERE DESTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
Line_290	YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
Line_291	HEAVEN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TOO
Line_292	HUSSY WOMAN AND BAND TIE

Line_295	HIPOCRIETT A HORSE DEALER
Line_296	HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE RACES
Line_297	ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHERE BY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
Line_298	TIED TO A WOMAN
Line_299	HAY FEVER AS HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW

Line_306	BUT RECONING TIME WHOSE MILLIAND ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWIXT VOWS AND CHANGE DECREES OF KINGS TANS SACRED BEAUTY BLUNT THE SHARPEST INTENTS DIVERT STRONG MINDS TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF TIMES TERINY MIGHT I NOT THEN SAY NOW I LOVE YOU BEST WHEN I WAS CERTAIN OR IN CERTAINTY CROWNING THE PRESENT DOUBTING OF THE REST
Line_307	SO I RETURN REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAINER BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT

Line_311	THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
Line_312	THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
Line_313	NATURE OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
Line_314	THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMERY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
Line_315	VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
Line_316	WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AND INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIAD OF INFENCY AND CHILD HOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
Line_317	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PEATSA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE IN TO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PEATSA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
Line_318	SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A SERCUITOUS RUT TO THE PIATSA THERE
Line_319	I AM VERY GLAD
Line_320	NOWDILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DALLAS
Line_321	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL ORE RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLOUENCE ARE SPECIALLY OUSEFUL
Line_322	THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DADLS IN THE PARLOUR
Line_323	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANODELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
Line_324	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
Line_325	PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
Line_326	YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DALL TO MAKE ROSILY A VISIT
Line_327	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAY THINGS SEEM
Line_328	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
Line_329	AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
Line_330	DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSENG WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
Line_331	DELLIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSILLY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
Line_332	FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINTS WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAPS
Line_333	AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROSE
Line_334	AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
Line_335	IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CHAP
Line_336	BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT SANDERS WAS A STUPID
Line_337	HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE
Line_338	HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BRAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANGERS
Line_339	WITH ONE JUMP TANTERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
Line_340	HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
Line_341	SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
Line_342	SO IT IS SAID SANDERS
Line_343	YES WHY NOT THOUGHT LANDERS
Line_344	THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANAPY WITH BOCAZS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
Line_345	ANDER'S FACE GROWS RED
Line_346	AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD AROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
Line_347	I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED SANDERS
Line_348	BUT SANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_349	HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_350	BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
Line_351	WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
Line_352	AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
Line_353	NOW MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
Line_354	ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PERIMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
Line_355	NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDED ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKNIFE
Line_356	THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
Line_357	BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAX IT OFF
Line_358	HE DARTED LAKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARDS
Line_359	THAT IS A VERY FINE CAPE YOU HAVE HE SAID
Line_360	THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHACE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONTINENTESE GOS AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICSE
Line_361	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTILL WE ARE GONE
Line_362	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGNE
Line_363	THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
Line_364	THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THER REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
Line_365	AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MERRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUOMELT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPITION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SIRGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPARABLE INJURY
Line_366	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLES
Line_367	IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERATED
Line_368	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
Line_369	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WI'LL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
Line_370	BUT FILLOP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
Line_371	IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMAN TOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
Line_372	WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VALED AND PINIENED AND SHOT IN BY DISBILITIES
Line_373	FATHER THESE UNJUST TO FILL UP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
Line_374	AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THE DORES LEARN MEDISON
Line_375	I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIK THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
Line_376	IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICKAPOOS
Line_377	IF I CAN GET PASTIENCE
Line_378	AND IF I HAD A FORTOON WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
Line_379	RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIISTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MOSOLIEM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECCOWING ROOMS AND NO COMFTERBLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMIDATION OF ANY BODY
Line_380	MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEDISON
Line_381	WHERE THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
Line_382	THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATION'S
Line_383	HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAIL ROADS AND THE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A KNEW COUNTRY
Line_384	SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PEANOW SAYING A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY MATALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEETING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ FHILLOPS LETTER
Line_385	I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER S
Line_386	THE SIGHTSEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
Line_387	RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACES IN TENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
Line_388	WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
Line_389	I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN AVENER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WISCLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
Line_390	IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONNET
Line_391	IS THEE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
Line_392	AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREET
Line_393	BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBLE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
Line_394	I WILL PRACTICE IT T
Line_395	DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAND IT SIX MONTHS
Line_396	HAS THEE CONSULTED THE MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER OF THE WANTS
Line_397	SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
Line_398	I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DIEMEUR PERSON
Line_399	AND THE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
Line_400	IS THY FATHER WILLING THE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLES
Line_401	BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NORE BROADSTREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MENT NORE THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLORATION IMPRESSED THE VISITERS SO MUCH AS THE SPLINDERS OF THE CHESTNET STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON AITH STREET
Line_402	RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT FILLIP HAD MADE A PUSHIN TO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
Line_403	WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIANCE
Line_404	THE STUDDY MEISEN
Line_405	IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LIE IN THE CURBSTONE AND SERATUS AS WE COME OUT
Line_406	THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCTECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
Line_407	MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLECIDITY
Line_408	HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLETTE AS A WENSDAY MEETING HON IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
Line_409	I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOMEC
Line_410	PHILLIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ACSTER LIBRARY PLANED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NIRSED HIS GENIOUS
Line_411	THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALLSTREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATERS
Line_412	HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
Line_413	HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITER OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
Line_414	BUT FHILLOP DID AFFORD IT AND HE ROAT THINKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SKEM WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
Line_415	TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSE WHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUN ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORISON
Line_416	IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
Line_417	THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP IN WRITING LETTERS FOR PFHILLOP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
Line_418	YOU'LL NEVER DIG IT OUT OF THE ASTER LIBRARY
Line_419	OH VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
Line_420	HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BRAKE AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKES A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
Line_421	AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTEREANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
Line_422	I'VE BEEN READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
Line_423	WHY IT'S IN MASURY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WELL GET A MAP
Line_424	WAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK AND THE ANTE ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS RIGHTING FHILLOP INVERIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISCUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTISS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDENT FIESE
Line_425	SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPITIOUS POULPET AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPLE OF REPENTENTS AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISTIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENITED REAGION WHERE THE DATE PAM GROWS AND THE NIGHTANGAL'S VOICE IS IN TOONE AND THE BOULBEL SINGS ON THE OFFNIGHTS
Line_426	THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THREST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LUTENATES STRAIN OR DOCTOR KAINE
Line_427	HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
Line_428	NO IT'S NOT TOO SOON
Line_429	HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTEER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LERKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF THEAVER
Line_430	WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGIENERE YOU COULD GO AS ONE
Line_431	YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROAD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGUERES
Line_432	HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LATHER
Line_433	THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXOLENCIE'S NOWLEDGE
Line_434	THEIR MASTERS SAID MISSUS NEVER BEND
Line_435	MISSUS NERVERBEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
Line_436	OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_437	I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUOARTER OF THE WORLD
Line_438	TODAY I SHOUTED
Line_439	JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
Line_440	THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
Line_441	THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTICY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
Line_442	WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
Line_443	WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTJLACKS SAID MY WIFE
Line_444	THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
Line_445	MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVE THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
Line_446	WE HAVE OUR LITTLE SHRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSEWATER
Line_447	YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTYLACKS
Line_448	AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAM COULD NOT ALASS
Line_449	AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMIS THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
Line_450	IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SERVIVE THAT PERIAD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN SEASE TO WORK
Line_451	I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTELACKS TO TUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
Line_452	JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
Line_453	THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTER
Line_454	YOU PROPOSED TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
Line_455	SIR KENNTON OVEL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
Line_456	THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDENANDO BROWN
Line_457	THE JAH BRIGHT HIS ARM WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANULA SHOULD PREVAIL
Line_458	THE LADIES IN COMPLYIENCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTARISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHERS
Line_459	I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRESTWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
Line_460	YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT CURTICY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
Line_461	BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONGE
Line_462	BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION IS ASKED
Line_463	YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTH WEST BURMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEN BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
Line_464	THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
Line_465	QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVAL
Line_466	THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
Line_467	OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROW SUCCESS
Line_468	OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NO WHERES
Line_469	BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNOR
Line_470	HOW MUCH OF EAVEL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EAVEL HAD THERE NOT ACCARED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
Line_471	THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THEM
Line_472	YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
Line_473	AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCISES OF THE GOVERNMENT
Line_474	THEN SAID SIR FERNANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
Line_475	I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY PAROULESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEAL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONSERNED OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUITE FORCE
Line_476	NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
Line_477	I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGERS SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BORD
Line_478	AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
Line_479	I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
Line_480	BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
Line_481	HAD EIVERCRESWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINTON OVEL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
Line_482	MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
Line_483	THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVERED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
Line_484	YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTELLACKS AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BORD
Line_485	I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERNANDO
Line_486	WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JAHN BRIGHT SHALL START
Line_487	WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
Line_488	WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSESSED AT THE FIRTHERST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SUCCLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
Line_489	THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXHALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR ENSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
Line_490	SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXOLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNER OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANULA
Line_491	NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORSE BEEN ONLY DOUBLED OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
Line_492	LUTENENT CROSSTRIES IS A VERY GALENT OFFICER
Line_493	BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITANNULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICLTIES
Line_494	WE SAT WITH THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
Line_495	WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
Line_496	WHAT WORLD WIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEACH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DIS LIKE ENTERED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
Line_497	I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE WERE DROUNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
Line_498	ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHER IS ON SHORE
Line_499	IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAM ATTALACKS HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JAM BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
Line_500	YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
Line_501	YOUR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
Line_502	ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALOON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
Line_503	IT IS A DUTY SAID IN

Line_680	ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEAPTHS OF OTIONWOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN MATROPOLIS
Line_681	YOU MUST SEE LUTENNT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
Line_682	THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
Line_683	ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEE WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMUNIUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BOIENT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF ISOLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRESIDEMNTED
Line_684	AFTER AN APPRENTIS SHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YOT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CROOSING IN THE MEDITORANIAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
Line_685	ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARRAN OF MARIN PRODUCTION OF ANY TIPE
Line_686	TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LAUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEAPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE ARIA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVLE WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRISPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SIGHT OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRISED LIKE THE SEETS OF AN AMTHATHIATER
Line_687	IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
Line_688	WOULD NOT THE LOUGHTEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
Line_689	IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDERS
Line_690	SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SOMET OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
Line_691	HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER THE POSESSED
Line_692	LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
Line_693	ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF IMFENTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
Line_694	BENSOUFS MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSENTLY WERE SERVIDECK'S EARS BESEEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPEAROLELLED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH OUR ANDISIMONL OF PERRIS THAT HE COULD SCEARSLY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSIAN
Line_695	NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BERGOSE ITSELF COULD VIE WITH A CHERCH AT MONTMARTREA
Line_696	UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENTION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTABLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN SIKCLOAPEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANICDOTS AND TRUPER'S TAILS HE WAS MACHLESS
Line_697	WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVERETE SAYING AMONXST ARTILLORY OFFICORS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHERK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVELOUS PERSUTS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADACK BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
Line_698	THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENSOUF'S ATCHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONOURS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
Line_699	WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADACKS
Line_700	AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMIIUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIOUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMULARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRETIES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
Line_701	THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
Line_702	NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUND IT YOORS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS OUR ANNELS RECORD
Line_703	OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE HA LATUOKE IN THE PERSUTE OF WISDOM SERCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEAN
Line_704	THEN THOU LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMMUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOFER WILL SPEAK OF THE OREGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MAN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZINS OF WHOM THE EAGIPTION RECORDS SPOKE
Line_705	MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YORS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDAN TIMES
Line_706	BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
Line_707	TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLON HEARD THIS STORY
Line_708	AND NOW HIS DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
Line_709	SULLEN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
Line_710	AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POIMN SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
Line_711	THE MOST FANEOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ILAND OF ATLANTIS
Line_712	FORE IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHINS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNTER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
Line_713	THIS IS THE EXPLENATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC MOTION
Line_714	SOME POIMS OF STOLLEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
Line_715	FOR AT THE PEROL OF HER OWN EXISTANCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLINS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVATER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
Line_716	I WILL IF TO MEN AS APPROVES I APPROVE
Line_717	I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL REED THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEASURE IN THE SACRED RAGISTERS
Line_718	SOPRATIES BEGINS THE TIMERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
Line_719	BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
Line_720	THE GENIALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMAL SOLLEN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
Line_721	BUT IN EAGIPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
Line_722	LISTEN THEN SO CRITICS TO A TALE OF SOLLENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPITUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLDE TO MY GRANDFATHER CRIDIOUS AND HE TOLD ME
Line_723	NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCOUSTOME MANNER
Line_724	THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFACT OF RIDTHEM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER YUSE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPATITION THAN ACCURS IN PLATOS EARLYER RIGHTINGS
Line_725	BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MESTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS INTHER PHEDRAS OR SYMPOSIAM
Line_726	MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCREATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMEIS
Line_727	PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
Line_728	THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THIOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CARRECTORISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
Line_729	WITH HERACLITIS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUXS LIKE AN EXCEGORIS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINENCES OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELIMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHEGORIGIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
Line_730	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TUTRILIGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
Line_731	AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSYNESS IN THE TIMES OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POWIM OF LEOCRITIOUS
Line_732	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEA AS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
Line_733	THE STIL AND PLEN OF THE TIMEIS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOQS
Line_734	HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONEMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES AR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GIOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN THE FLUDS OF SENCE
Line_735	THE DIEALOB IS PRIMARILY CONSERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
Line_736	BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
Line_737	HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE STILE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER IN THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
Line_738	THE FANCIES OF THE NED PLATENISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A FAZE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST SENTRIES OF THE CRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT HOLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
Line_739	THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME LTIPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
Line_740	IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTRBUTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
Line_741	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDISIN AND MATHOMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IN PIETY IN RINKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
Line_742	IN THE SUPPOSED DEAPTHS OF THIS DIALOG THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JUISH AND CRISTIANS SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VERIEANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
Line_743	BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
Line_744	THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MADEREN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMES FALLING INTO THE OBSERDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
Line_745	THE INFLOUENCE WHICH THE TIMES HAS EXERSISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISS UNDERSTANDING
Line_746	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAG
Line_747	THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SICOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECARD
Line_748	FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
Line_749	A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
Line_750	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACURASY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BACED UPON A CHARACTORISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
Line_751	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPAL IS LIABLE TO ACCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROCCIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
Line_752	I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BRECFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
Line_753	THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTANCE IN VERTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFONITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
Line_754	IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ELUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
Line_755	IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURASY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
Line_756	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
Line_757	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFONITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONSERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIASSY
Line_758	SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
Line_759	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT ACCURANCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
Line_760	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_761	THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
Line_762	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
Line_763	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
Line_764	ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALOFCIS OF WHAT ACCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
Line_765	THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HIPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
Line_766	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VERIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTINESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
Line_767	SYMONS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLYER LECTURE DO NOT TUTCH NOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
Line_768	THERE MAY BE A SPECIPIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONSERNED
Line_769	THE DEFONITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE TVERIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
Line_770	THUS NO NOWLEGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
Line_771	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGEMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
Line_772	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAG WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIEGE WE MAY SEE A FRIENDS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DESTORTED
Line_773	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ACCURANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST ACCURANCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
Line_774	A GRAMFONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMFONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
Line_775	IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESCENTRAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_776	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADIQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELLAMENTORY ACCURRANCE AS RECOGNITION
Line_777	RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY ENVALVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN OUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
Line_778	WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
Line_779	THIS DESTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
Line_780	IT IS THIS THAT IS A VENTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEGE
Line_781	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN NOWLEGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLES
Line_782	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADIQUAT TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
Line_783	I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_784	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POIM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
Line_785	THE ANALECIS OF NOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICOLT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
Line_786	THE FIRST OF OUR VAG BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_787	BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARNTED
Line_788	HABIT IS A CONCEPT ENVALVING THE ACCURANCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
Line_789	WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY ACCUERS WITHOUT A DEFENATE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SERCH THE ENVIRMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
Line_790	IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOAICEAND EFFORT
Line_791	THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVLES OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMBS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEASED TO CONSUME VALLIABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
Line_792	CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDERD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
Line_793	THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIERE OR SPIRITUAL NEEDS
Line_794	THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMAN
Line_795	IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
Line_796	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
Line_797	IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICABILITY OF CONSEMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELAIMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTECT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
Line_798	THE DEPENDANT WHO WAS FIRST DELIGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTIMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
Line_799	IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESANT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEASURE
Line_800	EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
Line_801	THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
Line_802	VERY MUCH OF SQUOLLER AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY
Line_803	IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT HOLY NOR CONISTANTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINSIHTE
Line_804	AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PERPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
Line_805	BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCAIL THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARAS LEASURE AND CONSEMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
Line_806	THERE IS A MOROLESS ELABERATE SISTOM OF RANKAN GRATES
Line_807	THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
Line_808	WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIMARY LEASURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED ONARIFIC CHARACTER
Line_809	THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
Line_810	IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUGGSURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEASUR CLASS
Line_811	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEASUR CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIVELY PREDITORY EMPLOYMENTS
Line_812	SUCH CONSEMPTION AS FALLS THRO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSEMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
Line_813	DRUNKENESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULENCES THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNORIFPIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFOID THE INDULGENCE
Line_814	THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A GERIVETIVE GROWTH
Line_815	IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DESIEESED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SINENIM FOR NOBLE OR GENTL
Line_816	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTATCHED TO THE PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS AT CETERA
Line_817	THE CONCEMPTION OF LUGURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONCEMTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
Line_818	SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRIEN MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
Line_819	WITH A FIRTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABUMAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THIORETICAL BACIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SEAM OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
Line_820	BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTIDATING THE IMMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABERATE SISTOM
Line_821	THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOCTIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT T
Line_822	THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S TRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARIFOINAILIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANCHIAL
Line_823	THE WEARORS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUFLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLES AND THE IGNOBLE
Line_824	WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENIFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
Line_825	BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
Line_826	MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEASURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESS A MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARSELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARCIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMAES
Line_827	UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERIGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
Line_828	THIS DIFFERENCIATION IS FIRTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILLITY
Line_829	THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUME AS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
Line_830	BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERISED THUS WASTEFUL
Line_831	UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTIZING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEASURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
Line_832	IN STRICT ACURASY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
Line_833	THE SAILS AND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
Line_834	BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCEAM LEASURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTFUL CONSEMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDERD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURS PECIBAL CULTURE
Line_835	OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF PERMITTING THAT INSTINGT DESPOSES MEAN TO LOOK WITH FAVER UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
Line_836	AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND IT'S UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
Line_837	THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE EMPLYES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANNAN OF CONSPICUOUS WAST
Line_838	A RECONSILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIRMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AN INTRICATE POLIGHT OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A SERIMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMILIARATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STIL AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALLEW OF THEIR TRAFHIC
Line_839	AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRICATTION
Line_840	THE GOATS WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
Line_841	THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN A ROSE OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATERS TO SIT UPON
Line_842	AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BULAROUS
Line_843	WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BULLAROU LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUSLED BECAUSE I HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
Line_844	THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STILE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDED
Line_845	MORNING GIRLS HOW PEEVILL AS WELL AS YE LOOK
Line_846	AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NITE THE BULAROU GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
Line_847	THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_848	HOLD HIM FAST MY MAN AND AS SOON AS IVE HAD MY COFFEY AND OATMILL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM
Line_849	I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BONED SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I AM LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELINGS
Line_850	BUT CATAIMBILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE USELESS
Line_851	I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MADE TO SCAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE
Line_852	BEFORE ANNY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAGISTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SORE FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MONING AND GRONING
Line_853	I SUPPOSE IT'S OF BRIEND
Line_854	WHY YOU SENT TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THE SPILLIGOATE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOAT'S HORNS
Line_855	RICH JULES OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGIOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVER BEARING
Line_856	THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURT YARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS THAT THE SAILEARMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
Line_857	I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP COFFY MYSELF SAID CAMBILL I'VE HAD CONCIDRABLE EXCRSISE THIS MORNENEN AND A'M ALL READY FOR BREKFAST
Line_858	COME AND GET THE BULAROUA SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES
Line_859	THEREFORE HER MAGISKTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
Line_860	IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROIAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THROWN CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEAN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY PPOSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNOUBNOSED PRINCESSES
Line_861	CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BULAROUW THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
Line_862	FINE CLARIORS
Line_863	THE IDEA OF PATCHING CATTAMBILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAFTER
Line_864	THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOAT GAVE A FINAL BUT THAT SENT THE ROBE OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE CORADOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHREEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERY ONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
Line_865	THE PLEASANT GRAVE YARD OF MY SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL SIPROS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I MAY STROLE IN MEDITATION AT MY EASE
Line_866	IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIY
Line_867	WHILE THE OLD GOLD AND THE MARBLES DAYZE FOREVER GLEAMING ITS SOFT STRANG BLAYZE CALM IN THE EARLY EVENING GLOW
Line_868	HE HAD GOT INTO HER COURTYARD
Line_869	IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPISTRIES RICH AND OLD
Line_870	THAT WAS BUT RUSTLING OF TRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK
Line_871	THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN SHE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS
Line_872	HOHE YE SALES THAT SEEM TO WONDER IN DREAME FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THIS SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND GUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEE OF WATERY ECOS
Line_873	OLD DANCES ARE SYMPLIFIED OF THEIR YOURNING BLEACHED BY TIME
Line_874	GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSICK ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDAINS INTIMATE WITH HOLLY HOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLES WHERE BIRCHES BAND TO CONFIDONTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMBED WITH A LILLY PLANTS
Line_875	OVER THE TRACKLINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MAN THE GRINNING MAN PASS
Line_876	SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT
Line_877	HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURTYARD
Line_878	THE PITY THAT WE MUST COME AND GO
Line_879	BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWNES MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLLER THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEP AND MEAT TO BRAKE AND FOME LIKE RAINMBOW VILLS UPON A BOBLE'S DOME
Line_880	VENNES
Line_881	SINCE LAST THIRSDAY I GIPP GACIZL HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BULAROUW OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONKURED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONKURED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BULAROUW AT ALL
Line_882	IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
Line_883	THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH THE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED
Line_884	SO GIPGACISL ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOMES
Line_885	I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BULAROUW AND I'LL FEED THE HONOURABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LETHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
Line_886	AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GITGACISL AND BUTTAN BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PEAIRET ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORELLI AND CAPTAIN TIN TENT AND ROSEALY THE WITCH
Line_887	WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THROWN ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE A SCIMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
Line_888	SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBAY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF SCIMBLES TOLD TROT AND CATANBILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASCEMBLED BEFORE THE PALLIS
Line_889	THE FORMAR BULAREUW GRONED
Line_890	YOU ARE A MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
Line_891	NOW THEN LETS ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST ITS BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONCURING KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
Line_892	WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
Line_893	AS A PRIVATE CITISEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
Line_894	THEN SHE GAVE ROSELLY BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
Line_895	WHEN THE BLUESKAN SAW GITKACISL THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVERET OF THE SOLGIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
Line_896	THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BAWL IN THE PALIS TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKES AND THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED
Line_897	EXCUSE ME SAID SHRHT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BULAROUW ANY MORE
Line_898	THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOULAROU OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THROWN ROOM OF THE PALLIS
Line_899	THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARDS THEM
Line_900	HUSL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD BULAROUW OUR REFORM
Line_901	DON'T WORRY SIZZLE DEAR IT ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
Line_902	HE DARTED THOUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MAIDEN
Line_903	HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREES BRIDGE
Line_904	HE STARED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
Line_905	THE WORLD WAS WATER VAALED IN MISTS
Line_906	THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVIST WAS UPON THE LAND
Line_907	PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEAPING
Line_908	HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DASILING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENIEETH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALLOVE GREAEN THICK TALL WEAT AND WILLOWY
Line_909	OWN SHE HURRIED UNTILL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ILAND LOW THE COTTAIN LAY BEFORE HER
Line_910	THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEAL THE EARTH STEAMED
Line_911	THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
Line_912	THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
Line_913	AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
Line_914	HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINATE WORK AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAWL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRRECTLY
Line_915	HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
Line_916	THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
Line_917	HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPER MOST SOPRA
Line_918	FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREES
Line_919	SHE ROSE WITH A FLEEING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
Line_920	WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
Line_921	THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVELED WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
Line_922	SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE
Line_923	HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEASE HIS AND SORAS MUST BE RUINED
Line_924	THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
Line_925	THE SQUAIRES OF COTTIN SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BIRST TO BOLES
Line_926	THE NED AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DOMBE SPEACHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLE FOR HER LIFE WITH NARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
Line_927	HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOW KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
Line_928	FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE ITS SON AND BIRD AND TREES
Line_929	IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTIN ITSELF BUT THE FANTICY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
Line_930	SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
Line_931	UP IN THE SICK ROOM SORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WIDE BEDS
Line_932	I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR TASTE CAPPASITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
Line_933	BUT WE ARE NOT A EXACTLY WELCOME
Line_934	BUT CRESTWELL ADDED SIGNIFICENTLY COMPASITY DIFFERS INNNORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
Line_935	MARRY TAILORW HOWEVER RELATED THE TAILE OF SORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
Line_936	THE VANDERPOOLES WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELEQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MISTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADDMINT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
Line_937	SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
Line_938	DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARRY TAILER
Line_939	WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHERS MEN
Line_940	THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARA'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER ESTERLEY'S WALLSTREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
Line_941	FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NOR THE NOSAND SOUTHERNERS ALL ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
Line_942	POSATIVELY HEROWIC ADDED CRASTWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
Line_943	AS SHE AWAITED HER GUEST SHE SERVAGE THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND IS QUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO KNIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECK THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIGHTEN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRIGHTEN MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOLE MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAILER AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATE SENETER FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTIS BY THE MEETING OF CONTAIN INTREST EARLYER IN THE DAY
Line_944	AT LAST THE COTTIN COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENET
Line_945	MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVITELY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROS A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTH WITH
Line_946	SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELIGANCE IN OTHERS
Line_947	MISS TAILER DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTIN BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKED SEEMED CALLED FOR
Line_948	BUT JOAHWN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELIMENTORY WORKS
Line_949	SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TUTCH IN SIGHT
Line_950	THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH A DESPRAT PROSE
Line_951	HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPORATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
Line_952	THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED
Line_953	THE GLIMORING SE OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
Line_954	CAETTEN SHE PAUSED
Line_955	MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING YOUSSEFUL DOWN THERE
Line_956	THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OVE SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMET SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANDS
Line_957	HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN SOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
Line_958	SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTEN COUNTY
Line_959	SO FOR THE HUNDRETH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LAIN BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROH THE BOTTOMS
Line_960	I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
Line_961	BETTER GO HE HAD COUNCILED SENTENTIOUSLY
Line_962	SOME TIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
Line_963	AT ANY RATE I SAY GO
Line_964	GOUUBAS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF BANS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAIMS IS THAT SO
Line_965	YOU AUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROWS I'LL SCEARSELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
Line_966	SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIOTICALS AND TALKE OF GRATE FILANTHRPIES AND REFORMS
Line_967	NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NOW NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTIN
Line_968	DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWOURDLY COMMENTED MISS TAILER LITTERLY BORN IN COFTTEIN AND O WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE YOUSE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
Line_969	FIND SOME CRESTWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
Line_970	IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIORS SOCIETIES HER DEFENSES OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
Line_971	BEEN LOOKING UP TOMS COUNTRY
Line_972	JOHN TAILOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER FRUE COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTIN
Line_973	CATEN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMMLY
Line_974	YOU KNOW CAPTIN LEAKE
Line_975	I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
Line_976	OH I KNOW THAT'S LORNE BRANDEN
Line_977	I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
Line_978	SAID LORD HELFORD ADDRESSING ME
Line_979	AT DINNER LEAKS WAS EASY AND AMUSING
Line_980	AND WILDER LAUGHED TWO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOR OF THE JOKES SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLENT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARTHY ONLY REMARKING
Line_981	DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I'VE REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRED OF COUNTRY LIFE
Line_982	ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
Line_983	I'M GLAD YOU'D LIKE IT SAIS WILDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_984	I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JULS
Line_985	WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
Line_986	HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKE'S SHOULDER
Line_987	BUT HER GREEDING TO CAPTAIN LEAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUTY AND FROSEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIYED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
Line_988	HE IS NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
Line_989	AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALELEGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLIGE AMUSEMENT
Line_990	WHERE UPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
Line_991	THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
Line_992	THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPPASSITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SERVIVE THE HERSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH MELIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOME HOW IN MY MIND WITH THE SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DESTINCT FROM HUMAN AND ESPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
Line_993	IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
Line_994	THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHAUL AT LAST SAID
Line_995	THE SOMBER OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HURSH PLOOMS BLACK AND AWFUL
Line_996	MY BEAD WAS UNEXCEPTIONALBLY COMFTERABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
Line_997	THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOON LIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOWS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MODELED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
Line_998	A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
Line_999	ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
Line_1000	IF A FELLOW HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BEEL ABOVE AT ONCE
Line_1001	SOME HOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
Line_1002	BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISCUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF A GENERAL SHIP
Line_1003	MISS LAKE DECLINED THE COARRAGE TO NIGHT
Line_1004	MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AND TOO DEEP
Line_1005	WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Line_1006	BRACKTON IS A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
Line_1007	DON'T INSULT ME STANDLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
Line_1008	I DON'T KNOW ONE CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMAN DEFIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMAIL I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LITES AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
Line_1009	BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOULLISHLY
Line_1010	TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSABLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS
Line_1011	AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
Line_1012	I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
Line_1013	AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS KAINE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_1014	NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE READY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
Line_1015	I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GOSTORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
Line_1016	OF LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
Line_1017	I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUSSION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEYS
Line_1018	YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
Line_1019	ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FASTED TAPISTRY
Line_1020	I BOLDLY LIFTED MY TERRUT
Line_1021	WELL YOU KNOW RADY WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACKTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORKS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
Line_1022	THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
Line_1023	IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CANNOT GET OVER DEAR DORKIS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
Line_1024	AND SHE THROUGH HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE REACHEL AT LAST BIRSTD INTO TEARS
Line_1025	AND THE WANE ORICLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORKIS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
Line_1026	SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEKS AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
Line_1027	YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RATCUAL HURRIDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWORLING IN HER FINGERS
Line_1028	POOR RATUL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEET AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TROUTH AS SHE DARED
Line_1029	SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF BLCOME
Line_1030	IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PASSED ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMENT'S FARM
Line_1031	WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
Line_1032	YES RACHEL I DO LOVE YOU
Line_1033	WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS A FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALLIS
Line_1034	YOU RESEMBLE ME RACIAL YOU ARE FEARLESS AND INFLEXIBLE AND GENEROUS
Line_1035	OF MARK WILDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMIS ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT HIM
Line_1036	CHELFORD HAD A KNOT FROM MISTER WILDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER KNOT HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO WAS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
Line_1037	BUT POOR RACUEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOWICAL HIPOCRESY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
Line_1038	THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RATUAL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
Line_1039	DORIS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
Line_1040	THANK YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHIEL MY ONLY FRIEND
Line_1041	YES SAID RACIAL
Line_1042	YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACUEL
Line_1043	THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LITING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOR BEGILING OUR SENCES
Line_1044	ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
Line_1045	I LIKE YOU STILL RACU'L I'M SURE I'LL ALWAYS LIKE YOU
Line_1046	I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
Line_1047	THANK YOU DORCAS DEAR'
Line_1048	RATCEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
Line_1049	THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFIS IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LAIS WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
Line_1050	LITTLE PERL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREST PLATE
Line_1051	THERE WERE A FEW ROSEBUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDENTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MITHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNELS SEETNED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
Line_1052	AT THAT EPIC OF PCRISTEEN SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLITER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WATE THAN THE WELFAIRER OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATERS AND ACTS OF STATE
Line_1053	LIFTING THE IERN HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTEL HESTER PRIN GAVE A SUMMENE WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FRE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
Line_1054	IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABOLISTIC FIGURES AND DIEGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LADE ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOOURIBLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
Line_1055	ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
Line_1056	WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMEET AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNER BELLINGHAM HAD PLANED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FARISTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
Line_1057	PERL SEEING THE ROSEBUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
Line_1058	WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PIRLS RICH AND LUXORIENT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHOWN WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSESSING INTENCITY BOTH OF DEAPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
Line_1059	THE PERIAD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLYER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DESPUTE CONSERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FEARSE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
Line_1060	IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
Line_1061	SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
Line_1062	THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMENY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THIS SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY OURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALEGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLIM OF HER GUILT AND TORCURE
Line_1063	PERL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMETOORE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
Line_1064	MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOKS
Line_1065	HESTER PRIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMAR ROULLER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND IMFLOENECIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRASY
Line_1066	ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTER TANKERED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PERL PEAPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNENT OF A RECENT DRAFT OF A L
Line_1067	BUT PERL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE NOD OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
Line_1068	YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
Line_1069	IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
Line_1070	YAY HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEACH
Line_1071	COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THE M
Line_1072	BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELENQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTANCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
Line_1073	BUT IN TRUTH PERIL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
Line_1074	HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF AIRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
Line_1075	HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGELLY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIAD WHILE PERL WAS EMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
Line_1076	IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MELITIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PERL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
Line_1077	MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISS FORTONS SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROLE OVER THE INFINT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
Line_1078	BRUDING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED THE SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSABLE INTELLIGENCE
Line_1079	THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
Line_1080	IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
Line_1081	HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
Line_1082	THEY WERE NOW ELUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTANCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WORTLWIND
Line_1083	PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFENTILE WORLD
Line_1084	BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PERSUE THE LITTLE ELPH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PERL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
Line_1085	GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
Line_1086	PERLEY SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTENCE
Line_1087	AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISSEPPLIN WHETHER ADDRESS TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PURL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
Line_1088	THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME ITS BEST
Line_1089	YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRING LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
Line_1090	THE GOOD NATURED ORDIENCE IN PITTY TO FALLAIN MAGISTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE SAM WHICH THE FORMAR HAD CALLED FOR
Line_1091	OR HATH HE GIVEN US MANY GIFT
Line_1092	HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISS FORTUNE
Line_1093	THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
Line_1094	THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREETY WITH THE KING
Line_1095	IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANKER AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAIRS FOR HIS SAFETY
Line_1096	AND THE MEN OF ISIRIL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDA AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
Line_1097	BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATTABLE THAT SKEAM WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
Line_1098	THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SAME WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
Line_1099	THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISTIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLLAR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
Line_1100	ANOTHER CREATURE AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISS GOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS SAM TO BE SUNG
Line_1101	THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
Line_1102	HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD MEN DEVOUR
Line_1103	HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBENS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LUNDON AS HARROW ON MAE HILL
Line_1104	WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORSEMENTS OF THE EATHOL MEN AND MACDOMOLTS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGILE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITENTS TO THE SWORD
Line_1105	HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
Line_1106	VALLER INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DEFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISSIPLIN ALSO WAS OBTAINED BY THE FORSES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONSERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
Line_1107	BY QUICK MARCHERST THROUGH THESE INEXCESSIABLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORSES OF THE COVENENTRS
Line_1108	HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORENCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALLERY AND FORTUON CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
Line_1109	FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVEINENTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROAIAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASCEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
Line_1110	FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICORS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
Line_1111	THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSEY'S COUNCILS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROIL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
Line_1112	MANTROS WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFENTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORSE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PEACES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD ORDEN ON THE PART OF THE ROIALISTS
Line_1113	AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MERCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOWGORISMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUWE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
Line_1114	THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUSE SELIBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SCURMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
Line_1115	THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURREGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTINENCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSTED ROIALISTS
Line_1116	WHILE THE FORMER FOR TOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
Line_1117	BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THROUW UP THEIR COMMITIONS UNDUN WEARILY FASCILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
Line_1118	THOUGH THE DISSEPPLIN OF THE FORMAR PARLAMENTORY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTABLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
Line_1119	THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLYED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTON AS MUCH AS OF SEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE OUR GIL COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INTERLOCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
Line_1120	DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGILE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUES OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENENTERSE

Line_1125	COMIN BY WAY OF THE MASURY RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLOUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOULDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVIRSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
Line_1126	HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLLAR TO HIS AREND MADE TOO ARREST

Line_1223	IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROUND
Line_1224	YES IT IS SUPPRESS
Line_1225	AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE ACCLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRAWYING ON THE SELIEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESINERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
Line_1226	YES SIR AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALEY
Line_1227	THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
Line_1228	HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
Line_1229	MASIRE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
Line_1230	SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAGISTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR SEAL THAT HE IS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
Line_1231	THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A CUADREAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE

Line_1234	BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBCIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
Line_1235	DISTAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAM SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
Line_1236	YOUR MAGIESTY'S PLAN THEN AND THIS AFFAIR IS
Line_1237	THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE REPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VERIETY OF COCKETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
Line_1238	YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURER
Line_1239	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERE HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AUCARAUNT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO CARTIERS
Line_1240	BUT IN THIS VINNET COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALS BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
Line_1241	SHE KNOWS THEM BOTH
Line_1242	BUT NOW HERE IS THE SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
Line_1243	THE BROWN GROWN BENIETH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TUTCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TUTCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDBLE
Line_1244	THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVERAET CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING ITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
Line_1245	IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHERS
Line_1246	MY FIRST IMPRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HEW SIDE BY SIDE
Line_1247	SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS INTANGLED CIGHT
Line_1248	EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHASER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
Line_1249	BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
Line_1250	EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
Line_1251	ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FIBRE
Line_1252	THUS IN CHASER'S DREAMS
Line_1253	THEY YUNIGHT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS KERISCURISTS
Line_1254	NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUEWS IT BECOMES SOME HOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PERILLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIMANDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JULS IF THEY ARE GRIDATED JUSTLY
Line_1255	IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILITY OF TEMPOR AND PILICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FILICITY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
Line_1256	EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLEGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUAL WORK OF HOLBINE OR DUR
Line_1257	THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEYS AND THE FLINT
Line_1258	IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARET WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATSIOS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
Line_1259	WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNERS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STIRNEST INTILECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPEMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1260	BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURASCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORSE AND ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
Line_1261	NOW HERE IS RAFIELL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
Line_1262	IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHAT SOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESKSNESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
Line_1263	YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUDS AND FIRE
Line_1264	HERE IS AN EQUALLY TIPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLLOR WHAT SOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELEUSS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APPOLLOW AND THE PITHOIN
Line_1265	YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITTION HOLBINES TURNER AND TINCRET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
Line_1266	THIS AT ONCE COMPELLES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING RULER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
Line_1267	DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONES
Line_1268	IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILLIAR OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DESTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDED REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
Line_1269	THAT A STIL IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERONIOUS
Line_1270	FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLAT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEASING ON THE MANIFUL DELITIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEASED BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANIOUS TUCH
Line_1271	IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLLORATLIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLLER AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS

Line_1274	SOME OF THE TUTCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAIDE IN LITTLE DROPS OR POAUNDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRISTALIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
Line_1275	IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOSE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
Line_1276	THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
Line_1277	IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KNIGHTS FLY FOLCOINS WHO INSTEAD OF OBAYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPARD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GEAREAGAL
Line_1278	NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
Line_1279	THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELIMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
Line_1280	THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELITIOUS PEROCAYE WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIM AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLADED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME

Line_1851	I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE AND TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TATTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THOUGH VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
Line_1852	HENCE THE EATISON ELECTROLITIC MEATER IS NO LONGER USED DESPIGHTE ITS EXOLENT QUALITIES
Line_1853	THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
Line_1854	THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTRALITIC MEATER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
Line_1855	THE LUNDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMINENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FUER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELLS CHERCHES STOORS AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADOCK
Line_1856	EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
Line_1857	BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSCERTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELLIMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
Line_1858	EDISON HAD ENSTOLLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GRAT CENTRAL STATION SISTOM IN NEW YORK ON THE MOULTIABLE ARK SISTOM COVERED BY HIS FEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST THE STRAT TOO WIRES SISTOM THROUGH OUT OF THE TRE KIND
Line_1859	THERE MESSIERS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDERED IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH YOUSEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
Line_1860	BROAD AS THE PRERRIES AND FREAN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS ITIOSENCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GAPEE
Line_1861	HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JAB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
Line_1862	I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRICIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISIPLIN OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
Line_1863	ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPERATIS WERE VERIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILES AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACURIASY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFTIVE CURRENT OR DAMIGE
Line_1864	THE DINAMO ELECTRIC MASHEN THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VECISITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
Line_1865	IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRA PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
Line_1866	THE STANDERD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE SELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
Line_1867	THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SISTOM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPATITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SISTOM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPATIS TO INCANDESANT LIGHTING
Line_1868	THE ARK LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A COUSTOMORS PREMISSES OR IN A SIRKET FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
Line_1869	FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT SIRCETS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN ERGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
Line_1870	HE SOON FOR SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECCONEMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICTS OF LARGE CITIES
Line_1871	EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GRASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A MEATER
Line_1872	THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBECATE AN ENGIAN FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDSON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARIN ENGIAN STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGIAN FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
Line_1873	THEY WERE LATER YUSED AS RESERVED MASHEENS AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGIAN RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ETISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY IS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN ENSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
Line_1874	MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WARS SISTOM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPCENSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPCENSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDPENDENT INVENTERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
Line_1875	IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSEBOWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
Line_1876	THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTOLLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANISED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
Line_1877	WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PIG
Line_1878	HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
Line_1879	THE PROBLEM WAS SOAVED
Line_1880	WE HAD MEATERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
Line_1881	THE MEASTER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE SENTURY
Line_1882	OWING TO HIS INSISTANCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROPITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN APPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
Line_1883	IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUW J JENKXS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THAN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
Line_1884	THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFNATE RESULTS ALL THOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BACIS
Line_1885	IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ELUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVERYIABLY SECURED IN THE STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
Line_1886	MISTER ALISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIMES
Line_1887	EDISON WAS INTOLORENT OF SHAM AND SHOTE AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICRISCOPE TASTUBE AND GALVENOMNER
Line_1888	THERE WAS INFINATE SCEPTISISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGABLE AS ELECTRISITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WAD AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
Line_1889	BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
Line_1890	HE WAIYED AND REWAYED THE MEATER PLATS AND PERCSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
Line_1891	UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGIN OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERN AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DINAMO AND LAMP ETISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
Line_1892	WHY IF WE ERECT THE STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONAMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
Line_1893	THE PARRIS PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE CRISTAL PALLIS WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
Line_1894	THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN MEIFOR RAGS

Line_1900	NOW WHEN HAS HORRER EVER EXCLUDED STUDY
Line_1901	NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
Line_1902	HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGWEGE A PHILOSOFER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
Line_1903	DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAINS WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
Line_1904	AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFERMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH THE VIEW TO REMITIY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICES PERMITTED

Line_2166	BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TROUTH THE EMPREMBIBED THE MACXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHERCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMTH OF CRISTIANITY

Line_2174	I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGALOUGHT LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
Line_2175	YOJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
Line_2176	I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
Line_2177	HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
Line_2178	WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
Line_2179	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAJITION WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
Line_2180	NO ONE WOULD DESTIRBE THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FORIST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
Line_2181	THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
Line_2182	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAIZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLLARS ARE SO MIXED UP
Line_2183	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AUS IN WHICH THEY LIVED
Line_2184	AND YOU MUST BE O JOS THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
Line_2185	AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS ASMA LIVES GREAN IS THE POPULAR COLLAR
Line_2186	AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR CKETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
Line_2187	UNK KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL LIMB BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITERS WITH A SMILE
Line_2188	I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUBERD AND THROUW OPEN THE DOORS
Line_2189	YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
Line_2190	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AIGHT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNSHKEEN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
Line_2191	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLLARS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKOANS ARE
Line_2192	BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSE WORK AND TO COKE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
Line_2193	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POUDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGALOT WHO WANTS TO YUSE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
Line_2194	HE WARE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE NEAEPANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WASTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAED WITH GOLD
Line_2195	INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WARE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE COUFTS OF GOLD BRAIDS
Line_2196	I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF ARES
Line_2197	THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE ODO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
Line_2198	I THINK THE NEXT CLASS CAT THE MAJITION MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
Line_2199	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPIT
Line_2200	YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNK NUNKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
Line_2201	THE FIRST LOT WERE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
Line_2202	YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALOUT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEETED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEET THAT MY HUSBAND FULLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POUDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBY THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLOCOONS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
Line_2203	WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNK SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
Line_2204	WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
Line_2205	WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALOUGHT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
Line_2206	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POUNDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLS
Line_2207	OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS PODER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CAN NOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
Line_2208	GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDDLE IN THE LAND OF AUS AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
Line_2209	THE WISERD OF AUS WHO USET TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WISERD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORSORIS
Line_2210	MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
Line_2211	DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOURE GETTING TO BE HUNK REMARKED THE MAJITION WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
Line_2212	SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
Line_2213	IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAJITTION
Line_2214	THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDES
Line_2215	I NOW USED THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
Line_2216	OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
Line_2217	SHE PORED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
Line_2218	MARGALADE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCH WORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCH WORK'S SCERT AND AN APREN WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
Line_2219	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAJGITIOAN REMOVED THIS POUDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
Line_2220	I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITERS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEMB AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
Line_2221	NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
Line_2222	ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
Line_2223	THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
Line_2224	I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEAED IN A SERVANT
Line_2225	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POUDTER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE COUBERD
Line_2226	THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POUDER
Line_2227	LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GULATIONS
Line_2228	WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
Line_2229	IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
Line_2230	A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY UNGUULATIONS
Line_2231	IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
Line_2232	THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
Line_2233	BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THE RE
Line_2234	THE WORKS HAD TO BE CONDENCED
Line_2235	THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YO WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHERCH ACTUALLY TO REED LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
Line_2236	THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
Line_2237	MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINA MYGOLATIONS FOR INSTANCE MEN
Line_2238	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOKE TO
Line_2239	IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S RIGHTINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CRIST MERITS ALONE
Line_2240	BY HIS RESERECTION CRIST WONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVELE DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVEL
Line_2241	THAT CRICKET IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PALL ESCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DESPENDS GRACE AND PEACE
Line_2242	OTHERWISE ALL SHOULD HAVE RITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESAS CRIST
Line_2243	PALLA TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
Line_2244	PALL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED GESAS CRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2245	AL THOUGH THE BRETHERN WITH ME ARE NOT APPOSSLS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
Line_2246	WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
Line_2247	NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PACIAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FORE
Line_2248	THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APPOSELS
Line_2249	INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHERCH OF CRIST FOR A LONG TIME
Line_2250	NOT ALL THE GOLATIONS HAD BECOME PROVERTED
Line_2251	THE GREEDING OF THE APPOSSTAL IS REFRESHIN
Line_2252	NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
Line_2253	AGAINST THESE BOSTING FALSE APPOSSELS PALL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APPISTOLIC ATHORIETY AND MINISTRY
Line_2254	THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2255	AT THE SAME TIME PALLE CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CRIST IS VERY GOD
Line_2256	THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPPINION
Line_2257	THESE PREVERTERS OF THE RICIOUSNESS OF CRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
Line_2258	AS THE AMBACITER OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRISTE SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN ATHORETY AMONG MEN
Line_2259	AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
Line_2260	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CAN NOT
Line_2261	I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
Line_2262	HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS APPISAL
Line_2263	DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
Line_2264	WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
Line_2265	PALLA CAME LATER IN HIS BENETH US
Line_2266	BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
Line_2267	THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
Line_2268	THEY SAID TO THE GOLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
Line_2269	WE ARE TO HEAR CRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
Line_2270	THE ARIANS TOOK CRIE FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGIELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND ERTH
Line_2271	HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF YOUR SINS
Line_2272	ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DISPAR
Line_2273	DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERITICS WOULD DIS OWN HIS ENTIRE CHERCH
Line_2274	MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
Line_2275	THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECES ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PALL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
Line_2276	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PELL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CAL
Line_2277	THE GREATNESS OF THE RANDSOME CRICHET THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
Line_2278	AND ALL THE BRETHERN WHICH ARE WITH ME
Line_2279	SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APPISTAL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APPOSSAL VERSE THREE
Line_2280	WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE WHOLLY CHERCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICKRIST RAINS THERE
Line_2281	ALL STICKS TO HIS THEME
Line_2282	EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
Line_2283	BUT THE REAL SEGNIFICENCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THE M
Line_2284	IN THIS WHOLE APPISEL PALL TREETS OF THE RESERECTION OF CRIST
Line_2285	PAL AND APPOSL NOT OF MEN AT CETERA
Line_2286	THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPLE PREDOMINATE THEY GO WERE THE CRISTIANS ARE
Line_2287	I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOFASTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOOSTING
Line_2288	IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE ATHORIETY OF SAINT PALL
Line_2289	GRACE ENVALVES THE REMIATION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
Line_2290	THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD AN DRUE SIN
Line_2291	TO DO SO IS TO LOOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLORABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS IMFINATE MAGIESTY
Line_2292	WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
Line_2293	THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
Line_2294	HE MENTIONED THE APPOSALS FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
Line_2295	WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
Line_2296	UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SOR CONSCIENCES
Line_2297	HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUSIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FAASTON UPON HIM
Line_2298	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAME IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
Line_2299	THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
Line_2300	EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
Line_2301	MAHOMET ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CRIT
Line_2302	FOR A PERSON TO POSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
Line_2303	SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CAN NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
Line_2304	THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKING CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
Line_2305	EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSSALES
Line_2306	THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PRENICIOUS DOCTRIN
Line_2307	IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORKS
Line_2308	HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
Line_2309	VERS TOM
Line_2310	THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
Line_2311	THE CLAWS SEEMED SUPERFOOLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
Line_2312	GRACE BE TO YOU IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD GESAS CHRIST
Line_2313	PALL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APPOSSALS WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MAN NOR BY MAIN
Line_2314	HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CRIST
Line_2315	WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
Line_2316	THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
Line_2317	PARTLY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDES HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
Line_2318	HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAY
Line_2319	I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MALLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY
Line_2320	ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
Line_2321	IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
Line_2322	THERE ARE FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD COTRTER
Line_2323	THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
Line_2324	THERE WAS WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMLET STUFFED WITH MUSHROMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
Line_2325	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PARIS
Line_2326	THERE JUST IN FRONT
Line_2327	I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
Line_2328	THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOWIEAL EVEN MAINHALL
Line_2329	THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLADESTAY YOU SEEN
Line_2330	HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLACKS AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABIES AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BANDNAMAIR
Line_2331	I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DIMURLY
Line_2332	FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE
Line_2333	HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA
Line_2334	WHEN PARTLY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STARS
Line_2335	COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEY IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE
Line_2336	HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
Line_2337	ALEXANDER CLENCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
Line_2338	IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S
Line_2339	PARTLY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TUTCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
Line_2340	WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERY
Line_2341	LAM WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
Line_2342	HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATER YEARS
Line_2343	DON'T I THOUGHT I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID HER SON TURN OUT
Line_2344	THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEY AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
Line_2345	THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS
Line_2346	THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS SO GOLLY
Line_2347	IT WAS VERY JOLLY SHE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEY
Line_2348	HE FELT A TREMAR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
Line_2349	THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
Line_2350	NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
Line_2351	WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOUTHS
Line_2352	HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVEASLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLER
Line_2353	I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COULSON MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
Line_2354	I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
Line_2355	I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
Line_2356	PARTLY BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE
Line_2357	SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSETE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
Line_2358	DON'T CRY DON'T CRY SHE WHISPERED
Line_2359	HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
Line_2360	SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
Line_2361	WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TWO NIGHT
Line_2362	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_2363	THE STOPP AT QUEENS TOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
Line_2364	IT WAS MY SELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
Line_2365	HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
Line_2366	HE TOOK HER ROUFFHLY IN HIS ARMS DO U KNOW WHAT I MEAN
Line_2367	I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
Line_2368	THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
Line_2369	KEEPE AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FOLLOWED YOU
Line_2370	WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMIS NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEGG
Line_2371	BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBAREABLE
Line_2372	ALEXANDER PASSED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTENING AND UNBUTTENING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
Line_2373	THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTELY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
Line_2374	HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED
Line_2375	I THOGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
Line_2376	WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
Line_2377	BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
Line_2378	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
Line_2379	SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATTEPOLT IN LEACH
Line_2380	WORN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
Line_2381	HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM THE CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARSELY BREETHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES I T
Line_2382	ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW I'M OWERDLY
Line_2383	I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
Line_2384	ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN
Line_2385	YES YES HE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
Line_2386	PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU A HAPPY
Line_2387	SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
Line_2388	YOU SEE LOVING SOMEONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
Line_2389	I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISURIBLE
Line_2390	HO BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
Line_2391	I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDED WAS GOING TO TURN UP
Line_2392	BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
Line_2393	I MUST KNOW ABOUT YAOU
Line_2394	AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_2395	YES HELDAR I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
Line_2396	ALEXANDER GROANED I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T
Line_2397	I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
Line_2398	ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
Line_2399	BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
Line_2400	SHE SAVED HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
Line_2401	AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TOO FORGET
Line_2402	IREAN BERGOIN ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
Line_2403	SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
Line_2404	MAN HALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINER
Line_2405	YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE AS BI CONSCIOUS TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
Line_2406	WESTMIR AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
Line_2407	IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOUSAN TIMES ALREADY
Line_2408	SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
Line_2409	I'M GLAD SHES HELD HER OWN SINC
Line_2410	MAN HALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
Line_2411	HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEAN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BEAR FOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
Line_2412	SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINER
Line_2413	HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
Line_2414	HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORSE
Line_2415	A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
Line_2416	ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINTEFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
Line_2417	OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENCEIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
Line_2418	I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
Line_2419	I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TONIGHT ISN'T SHE
Line_2420	IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO
Line_2421	HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MACCANICS
Line_2422	DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MANHAWL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOPP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBED HIS PINK CHEEKS WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITISISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
Line_2423	AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG
Line_2424	SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
Line_2425	FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THEY HEARD A VOICE WARENTOONS
Line_2426	SAVE ME MASTERS BUT YOU STARTLED ME RARELY
Line_2427	WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE COURT FROM MY WINDOW
Line_2428	THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO KGAMEWELL'S CHAMBER
Line_2429	BE NOT SO FULLISH FRIENDS SAID FITS UTH CROSSLY
Line_2430	ROBIN FITSUTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBORING THEM
Line_2431	TIS LATE AND I GOT MYSELF WITHIN A SHORT SPACE
Line_2432	THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR GEARNY AND UNDER THE BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF THE STABLE ROOFS
Line_2433	THERE BEFELL AN ANXIOUS INTERVIEW MISTRESS FITSUTH ARGUING FOR AND AGAINST THE SQUIRE'S PROGECT IN A BREATH
Line_2434	AS ANY IN ENGLAND I WOULD SAY SAID GAMEWELL PROUDLY THAT IS IN HIS DAY
Line_2435	HE EMPLOERES US TO BE DESCREET AS THE GRAVE IN THIS MATTER FOR IN SOUTH HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS
Line_2436	THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LEAD FROM THE HUTTEN PLEASANCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT JEFFERY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FORRIST

Line_2547	SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
Line_2548	HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELYENCE
Line_2549	THE DEMOCRATIC COMLITTY FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
Line_2550	TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANCIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
Line_2551	ONE OF MISTER HOPCON'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HINCHMAN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED

Line_2579	THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHRUBD FACE
Line_2580	I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARCIEL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
Line_2581	THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
Line_2582	A FRESH HOLSOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GREY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A CENCETIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
Line_2583	HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPASITSION THAT WOULD ENDEAVER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
Line_2584	I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY
Line_2585	OLD WELL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
Line_2586	GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORCH CHECK AND CASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS

Line_2588	WORSE TAM WORSE THAN EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GRLOUMLY
Line_2589	BETH UNEASY AT A SILENCE NUDGED HIM
Line_2590	HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE HAD BEEN SHARP
Line_2591	MISTER GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
Line_2592	SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
Line_2593	AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLOERS
Line_2594	YOU'RE FULLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALTHIS
Line_2595	AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION

Line_2601	I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LOYER
Line_2602	IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYENCE

Line_2610	BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
Line_2611	HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHEKS OF THE CONSERN
Line_2612	HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
Line_2613	IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL IN FEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TROUTH
Line_2614	MAY WE SEEM GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
Line_2615	THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
Line_2616	WHOSE NAME DID YOU SINE TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
Line_2617	SOMETIMES I'M THAT YURNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHERS
Line_2618	IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
Line_2619	THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO WRECK AND RUIN

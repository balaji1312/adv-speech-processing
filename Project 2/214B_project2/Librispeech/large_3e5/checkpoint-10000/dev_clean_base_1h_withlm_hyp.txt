Line_74	HE IS A GREAT SIENTIST
Line_75	WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVELESS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERLY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN

Line_77	CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOME COMING
Line_78	LINCON HAD CALLED FOR VOLLANTEARS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLIAN BUT HARRY HEARD EVERY WEARE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFETERASY WAS NOW SECURE

Line_80	BILL SKELLEY AND HIS GANG THEN MOUNTENEARS HER UP
Line_81	THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMPTOR IS OURS
Line_82	HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERY MAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
Line_83	HERRY FEELING PRID BUT NOT SHOWING IT SELUDED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DULENAZSE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGAGE

Line_92	HERRIY GAVE HIS FAIR WELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
Line_93	CURNEL KENTEN RIGHTS WISELY
Line_94	IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTERN AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STIRTY BOY THE SUPPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
Line_95	AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF AMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERY BODY WITH IT
Line_96	HE GAIZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONCIBILITIES AND PEARRIELS
Line_97	BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
Line_98	HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SATTLEBAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERY MAN ROAD AWAY
Line_99	HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM

Line_102	THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBER FORTS AND SITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEE LEAVING ALL THINGS EDGH SHARPLY IN THE DASILING SUNLIGHT OF U SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
Line_103	IT WAS A DIFFERENT HERRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
Line_104	HE SOON LEFT CHARLSTON OUT OF SIGHT
Line_105	PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
Line_106	THE AIR TWO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CARALINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT
Line_107	CURNAL LEANIDAS TELBET WEREGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
Line_108	HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NAITIVE STATE
Line_109	THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOT OF GLOOM
Line_110	THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
Line_111	THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES AN OLD CENTUCKY
Line_112	HOW THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTERS
Line_113	THE GREAT STATE OF VERGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNIAN AT LAST AND NORTH CARALINA TENS AND ARCONSAW FOLLOWED HER BUT MERILAND CENTUCKY AND MASURY STILL HUNG IN THE BALLENCE
Line_114	BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLSTON THE GAY THE VALT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
Line_115	BORAGARD AT ONCE ROAT AN ORDER
Line_116	HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DEIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
Line_117	THE NEDDEL AND THE DARK SAID JOSIF
Line_118	BLESSD AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESS SHALL I BE THERE THEN
Line_119	HE LAY DOWN HIS VIAL IN AND SEETED HIMSELF WHERE MARRY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
Line_120	NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSITION
Line_121	IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED ERLY
Line_122	A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YEALD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
Line_123	HIS TRESURE TAKEN TIPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
Line_124	IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTROMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
Line_125	BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VILE IN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
Line_126	IT CRIED A LOUD THAT ETURNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALLIS WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
Line_127	HIS VIELIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEAING WAS MADE HOLE
Line_128	LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EAQUAL TO THE IMERGIENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARRY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITER
Line_129	ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEF LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITTHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIAL IN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARRY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TE
Line_130	ERTH WAS GONE AND HEVEN WAS ALL
Line_131	THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSIF LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRMENTS
Line_132	HE STARTED TO COUNSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
Line_133	LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
Line_134	WHEN THOU LOVE ST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YAY OR EVEN DOG A RIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH TH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
Line_135	HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL I LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
Line_136	HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
Line_137	HE PRESSED HIS VILIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
Line_138	A SOAB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BIRST FROM MERRY'S BOOSOM
Line_139	HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEAPING
Line_140	WAS THER EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSIF THAT NIGHT AS HE STROED ALONG THE FOOTPATH
Line_141	WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLLORS
Line_142	THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
Line_143	THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSESSED HIM ASSERPING AS IT WERE THE THROWN OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT SEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
Line_144	IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
Line_145	I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VILE IN AND THE WORSHIP WAS INTREETY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
Line_146	HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIEL IN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PEANO THAT THEN SOME HOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
Line_147	JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOD TO THINK OF THE SAR OF US
Line_148	LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD IS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
Line_149	SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH THE BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERMENT
Line_150	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLY ANY SUCH HAIRBRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSABLE CHARMS FOR ME
Line_151	MISTER MORTAIN REPLIED THE FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAME UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOL PURPOCE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
Line_152	EVEL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTAIN OR WHO HOLDS CHERCH GOVERMENT AND SERIMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTU
Line_153	MISTER MORTAIN SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLY'S VISIT TO DONNALD BEAN LEAN
Line_154	HE CERTAINLY POSESSES TALLENTS BEYOND THE RUDSFEAR IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCOMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DESTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIAD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
Line_155	HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NORE WITH MY RECHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPITIONS AND HIS INFURANCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUESITION
Line_156	CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT
Line_157	THEY HELD CONVENTBLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREETED WITH GREAT VIELENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE RAINS
Line_158	MISTER MORTAIN THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDOM OF THE VERIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONELD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
Line_159	IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
Line_160	EXCLAIMED TRAT OF COURSE
Line_161	PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICUL ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILAR'S FACE CLOSELY
Line_162	BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL RONG SAID TORMOLIEN GRAVELY
Line_163	A MISSFORTUN OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FAT
Line_164	IT HAD NO ORNMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
Line_165	IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTEN BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITELED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
Line_166	I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVELEGE
Line_167	SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
Line_168	WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NORE ARE WE SAVAGE OR CROOEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I'M REALLY PUSLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
Line_169	EVEN IN AMERICA EVERBODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AND THE BLUE SKINS ARE SO FRIGHT OF THEIR BULAROU THAT THEY TRAMPLE WHEN EVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
Line_170	IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
Line_171	AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATU OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES AND AGES TO COME WILL THEN ONOUR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UP RIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWORD
Line_172	WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN
Line_173	CORLEY DO YOU CONSIDER MAGISTY A PROPER WORD TO YUSE ONE ADDRESSING A QUEAN
Line_174	I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
Line_175	YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
Line_176	IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITISEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
Line_177	ARE YOU A JIANT
Line_178	HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HULTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALLIS OF TORMOLIE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
Line_179	WHAT IS IT CORELLEY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
Line_180	SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
Line_181	HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROTSKIN
Line_182	DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALLICE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
Line_183	THERE IS NOTHING MAGESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
Line_184	THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALLIS
Line_185	THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GARD THE WELFAIRE OF MY SUBJECTS
Line_186	SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTENBRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAPTAINBILL WAS SO MUCH BIGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
Line_187	NO OUR WAY IS BEST
Line_188	THEY SEEM VERY IGNORENT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
Line_189	THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED THE MAN IN THE CROUD
Line_190	THE QUEEN IS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GREVENCES AND TO COMPELL ORDER
Line_191	THE QUEEN GAYZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTREST
Line_192	YES IT WAS WET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILER BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
Line_193	EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SEEN STILL MAINTAINED THE MANASTIC ELUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAIVERLY HAD CONCERED UP
Line_194	THE EVEL AND REMADY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOT FROM OUR PRESANT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENCE DOGBILL
Line_195	THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NERROW AND STEEP ROFT BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE
Line_196	YET THE PHYSIOGNMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES IN FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MANERVA
Line_197	IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIAD WHEN CASSILS WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCATECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESINING A DOMESTIC RESIDENTS
Line_198	IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOWS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
Line_199	IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLY ENTERED THE STRAGLING VILLAGE OR BRATHER HAMLET OF TULEY VALE ON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETER
Line_200	NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
Line_201	THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
Line_202	THIS AVINOW WAS STRAT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROAE OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESNEUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SICOMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NURRISHED SO LUXURIANTELY THAT THEIR BOWS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENIETH
Line_203	THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
Line_204	TWO BATTLMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVINEW AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE
Line_205	OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSIMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDELE RUSHED LIKE A CIBLE IN FRIENSY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE SELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNTBURNT LOITERERS SULUTED HIM WITH THE SOUND COUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGIEAN THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VAIRLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TALK OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREABLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRAN
Line_206	THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AND ACCOUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
Line_207	STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUAIR
Line_208	AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAGESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVER
Line_209	MISSUS BOSELE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUISINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
Line_210	DOES ONE MISTER SAMIOUAL BOSEL LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELLIAN
Line_211	BUT TRIVALLIAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISCUSTED AND REVULTED MOST UN REASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
Line_212	THE PETERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFENTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOSEOLE'S LAW
Line_213	IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBERA SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVIEAR BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPOLES
Line_214	OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOSEL
Line_215	IT'S THAT AS MAKE SIME N I WON'T SAY WOT
Line_216	HE IS UP IN TOWNSER A MINDING OF HIS PARLAMENTORY DUTIES
Line_217	A DISTINCT PROMISS OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRIVELLIAN ON TRAVELLIAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
Line_218	THEN BASEL CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
Line_219	AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GATE AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
Line_220	I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BE EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOSEL IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOSEL TUTCHED HER FOREHEAD
Line_221	PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TRIVILLIAN
Line_222	BASELE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
Line_223	AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXHERTIONS SHE WOLD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LOIERS
Line_224	AND ALL WORK HAD SEECED WITH HIM
Line_225	WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWEARS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE RONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED TO GET HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
Line_226	IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME SEAL
Line_227	AND BASEL AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
Line_228	DRATHEM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
Line_229	BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD BE
Line_230	TRIVELLIAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN I WAS RITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIMMINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIMMINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
Line_231	I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
Line_232	IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGJESTED BOASEL
Line_233	MISSUS BOSELE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADYES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOOM MADAME TE WAS ENTITELED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
Line_234	HE CANT SUCKLE HIM KANNY
Line_235	I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRIVILLIAN
Line_236	IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSEL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
Line_237	AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOSELE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONEY WALK
Line_238	AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMIOUAL BOSEL THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
Line_239	BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'E BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
Line_240	BOSOLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTENED OVER HIS BREST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
Line_241	ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISTION BY OBAYING ME A SECOND TIME TODAY
Line_242	I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME

Line_464	THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
Line_465	THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF ERSIS ITS PREPORTIONS OGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A RECHED BOOTH INTO A THEATER
Line_466	FROM SIXTEEN AIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
Line_467	THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MASHEEN WAS OVERWELMING
Line_468	WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
Line_469	SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONGECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERY WHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE GERNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRISAND FATES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWENPLAIN
Line_470	THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HILL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITENNERANTE PURITON PREATURES WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORRER
Line_471	THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
Line_472	ERSIS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITHION IN THE ORCOUSTRA
Line_473	IN GWIENPLAIN'S EVEL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
Line_474	WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
Line_475	UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
Line_476	ON THE ROOF FROM A TWO PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE ARROSE
Line_477	FEBY COOKED VENUS CRUB THE TEMPLE
Line_478	THE WEALS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WEALS
Line_479	THIS FORTON HAD ALLOWED ERSIS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATER OF GWINPLAIN'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARRIEAT OF HIS DREAMES CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARIVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEIATER AND TO SO SIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
Line_480	THE CARRIVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_481	A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SEINS AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
Line_482	THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO ERSES IN GWIENPLAIN
Line_483	ERSIS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE ROUT THE PIESES
Line_484	THIS GREEN COLLER HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
Line_485	FOR THESE RED FEBY AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNSIATION
Line_486	THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
Line_487	NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICKHTIS
Line_488	HAD GWENPLAIN WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
Line_489	GWRIENPLAIN WAS A MOUNT BANK
Line_490	BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIEANCE TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANESTHESIA
Line_491	ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MENIPULATERS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
Line_492	BUT IS LAFTER A SYINENEM OF JOY
Line_493	IT WAS GWENPLAIGN'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUPFTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
Line_494	IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MISTERIOUS AND PROBABLY ACCULT SIGIENCE WHICH WAS TO SERGERY WHAT ALCOMIY WAS TO CEMISTRY HAD CHISLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANEFACTURED HIS COUNTINENCE WITH PREMEDITATION
Line_495	HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
Line_496	HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DIED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPORATION HAD LEFT IT WOULLY AND ROUGH TO THE TUTCH
Line_497	GWENPLAIN HAD YELLOW HAIR
Line_498	ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN OUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGRIVATED IT
Line_499	ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER AMAINED THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
Line_500	THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIER
Line_501	THE OPPERATION WHAT EVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH AND TO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONEY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
Line_502	WITH THIS EXCEPTION WENDPLAIN'S LAUGH WAS EVER LASTING
Line_503	AN EVER LASTING LAUGH
Line_504	THE JOYOUS CONVULTION OF LAUFTER WAS AS A TRIBUT PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MACANICALLY
Line_505	BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESORSES OF A JIMNIST AND AN ATHOLEET
Line_506	THE WHOLE OF EXISTANCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSCRIPT
Line_507	THE MENICIANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICTATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
Line_508	SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
Line_509	AT EVERY PERFORMENCE THE YARD OF THE IN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC ODIENCE
Line_510	THE MERRY ANDROUS AND MOUNTAIBANKS OF TARINSO FIELD WERE AGAST AT GWINPLAIN
Line_511	THE GLORY OF GWENPLAIN HAD NOT PASSED LUNDON BRIDGE
Line_512	IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTH WORK

Line_518	THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITER
Line_519	THE EMPTYING OF TANKERDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
Line_520	AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
Line_521	WE ARE IN LUNDON SAID ERSIS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
Line_522	BESIDES THIS HE HARANGED LIKE CISERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLED HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
Line_523	WITH THAT ECEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTABANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PEROLLELL
Line_524	THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
Line_525	AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REALING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
Line_526	GWENPLAIN AT UP THEIR PUBLIC
Line_527	HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDRAL
Line_528	IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX

Line_531	HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED ERSIS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWIENPLAIGN TO OBSERVE HIM
Line_532	BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARROL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FEBY AND SOMETIMES FENOUS
Line_533	HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
Line_534	ALL SOUTH WORK RAN IN CROUDS TO ADMIRE THE LALPFING MAN
Line_535	THIS CONNESOR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADDOPTED THE LAUPHING MAN
Line_536	ERSIS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUS OF SOUTHWOARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
Line_537	THE PLACKARD GWIENPLAINE THE LAUPING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SINE OF THE IN
Line_538	SAINT PALL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES

Line_646	JOHN MANGLS THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE RECHED HOLE WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DIS COMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
Line_647	THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
Line_648	MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISERTATION ON THE POMPIS OR ALSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEWSEELEND FELL ON COLD AND IN DIFFERENT EARS

Line_654	SO THAT ON THAT SCORD THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
Line_655	THEIR MINDS WERE SO DESTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUBT AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
Line_656	YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
Line_657	GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETIN WHY JOHN
Line_658	HIS EYES WANDERED SEESELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORISEN
Line_659	FURNS AND POAMES MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COLFIRE AND HOW AD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONS
Line_660	BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEAN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
Line_661	THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COLBED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
Line_662	IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GASMAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THROUGH IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT LADER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
Line_663	LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
Line_664	THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WISTER SONGS
Line_665	WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT F THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES

Line_670	ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGH OUT THEIR LIVES
Line_671	THESE FORIST WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOMEWAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FURNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PAMELEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
Line_672	AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOR HOUSE
Line_673	SEE BENIEETH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKIN OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LINE A SLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF JIGANTIC POALMELEAVES STROED AMONG THEM
Line_674	WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO AD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
Line_675	WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD CEAPT ON BURNIN WOOD TO THIS DAY
Line_676	WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUFH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLISSTERING TO HEAL THEM
Line_677	THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
Line_678	IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERR BEFORE THE SUPPREME JUDGE
Line_679	GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
Line_680	DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTANCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LEAD TO THE UNDERTAKING
Line_681	WATCH THE SAVAGES OUT SIDE SAID ROBERT
Line_682	LISE SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
Line_683	WILSON AND OBENET JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WICESTER NAILS WHILE MOLERATY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NAITIVE GARD TORE A CREVAS OF THE MATTING
Line_684	AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT

Line_687	MY LORD WHICH EVER OF US SERVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARRIY GRANT
Line_688	ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLACXS ROAP
Line_689	GLENARVOIN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
Line_690	WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
Line_691	BUT SOFTLY AS A NAME WAS BREETHED MARRY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARDS GLENARVEIN AND SEASING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH IRTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
Line_692	THEIR FINGERS BLEED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER A HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREECE SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAR OF ERTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
Line_693	JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONYARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH THE NA PRTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEASED THE HAND THAT WEALDED IT
Line_694	SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ADBAINCE SOON WAY DOWN THEIR EILIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
Line_695	THE MEAL ENDED
Line_696	THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
Line_697	JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISSE MARRY WHAT I PROMISSE LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
Line_698	ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHOUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
Line_699	I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FALFILL THAT PROMISS
Line_700	THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TIL THE TOPS OF THE WAHETE RAINGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
Line_701	ECOWED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
Line_702	BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDINER CAME WHISSTLING FROM HIS FARMWORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
Line_703	WEADS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION RAINED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIENT LITTLE GARDEN
Line_704	YOU SURLY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORSED TO CLIME REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BEAR STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
Line_705	WHAT A FUSS HAS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
Line_706	OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMING UP THE FRIENDLY FIRPOL
Line_707	INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISTCHIVOUS SUGGESTIONS
Line_708	THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVERIT GARDEN
Line_709	I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TI UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
Line_710	MEANWHILE HOW FAIRED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
Line_711	MY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXORIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
Line_712	DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGH OUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEABLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
Line_713	THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLLECK ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILLY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEMB BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
Line_714	THE HUNYSUCLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
Line_715	YOUR COUSEON THE WILD CONVELVIELIST WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
Line_716	BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
Line_717	MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE CEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIERE WOARMS WHO DELIGHTE TO DESTROY OUR RUITS
Line_718	MAKING A SORT OF EADDYING SIRKET ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVIELAS POLE TOR THE STRIPPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILLY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTONINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEAVELED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
Line_719	HE REALLY GREEVED TO SEE IT
Line_720	STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORENT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
Line_721	IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTILL A GENTL HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
Line_722	HE ENTERED A LARGE FOURCOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AL
Line_723	HE ENTERED THE GARD ROOM THERE THE GARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOLDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
Line_724	HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
Line_725	THE VIELINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXOLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMENER MARRIED THE ROIAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPPLE OF THE CASTL
Line_726	THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDER BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
Line_727	THEY TALKED FOR FOUR OUERS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
Line_728	HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APPARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADYES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
Line_729	SCARSELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
Line_730	THE LADY AND WAITING BECAME VERY IMPACIANT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
Line_731	ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGER WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND AT THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_732	I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
Line_733	NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTELS AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN ONNEUST OLD WOMAN SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EADICT
Line_734	WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVER JOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CRISENING TPHEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
Line_735	THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
Line_736	ONE OF THE YOUNG FARIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARME THE OLD FARIY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
Line_737	IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
Line_738	THE TURN OF THE OLD FARY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALLIS THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PEARSE HER HAND WITH A SPINDEL AND DYE OF THE WOUND
Line_739	SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDEL THEN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PEARSED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
Line_740	BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
Line_741	HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTAL BUT BEHOLD
Line_742	MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
Line_743	THE DAY IS COMING SAID POMITHIOUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MAN KIND FROM THE ERTH
Line_744	AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMIETHIOUS ON MOUNT COCOUSIS AND HAD SENT DESIEESES AND CARS INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
Line_745	BUT MEN CEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POARING DOWN AND THE SEE WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
Line_746	SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DUCALIAN
Line_747	WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DUCALIAN TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
Line_748	WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PITRA
Line_749	IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DUCALIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF PORMITHIOUS
Line_750	THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SORSE OF TROUBLE
Line_751	NO ONE BUT DUCALIAN THE SON OF PROMITHIOUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
Line_752	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
Line_753	GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPT INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
Line_754	BUT DUCALIAN AND PIRRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
Line_755	WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL LEAGER TO SERVE THEM
Line_756	THEY PERSADED ELIQUENTLY
Line_757	I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISSTLE
Line_758	BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLLED PROBLIM
Line_759	HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOES IT WAS NO GO
Line_760	RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRAD HAD FALLEN IN IT
Line_761	HE WALKED UP AND SAIS HELOW BOYS WHAT IS IT BASS
Line_762	THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON D MERFRIS BURROA PIKE
Line_763	THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
Line_764	THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN OUT WELL ALL NIGHT
Line_765	WE WERE ENNURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SCURMISH AND EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREET IND EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEET
Line_766	YANK SAIS WHAT DE YOU DOING JOHNNEY
Line_767	BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAIS GENTLEMAN I GANNE THE LAW
Line_768	OUT SIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
Line_769	ADVANCE INTO TENNASE
Line_770	WE HAD BEAF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
Line_771	A YANKE ALWAYS SAIS NAGER
Line_772	WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE A SLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
Line_773	THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGOW FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LOW THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
Line_774	A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
Line_775	A MAN IN THE WELL
Line_776	WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COST WAS CLEAR
Line_777	HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAIZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THY WERE ORDERED TO RETREET
Line_778	YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
Line_779	WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATEHOUCHIE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME RUIT ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAINE UNDER JO JOHNSON
Line_780	WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNASY SIDE OF TENNASY RIVER
Line_781	HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AC KIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISS AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
Line_782	WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BREGADE CHEETOM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
Line_783	I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOLDER
Line_784	AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVER TOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
Line_785	THE YANKES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
Line_786	BUT IT COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WARING DEAD MAN'S SHOES
Line_787	BAD GENERAL SHIP I FOUGHT IT WAS CRISMOSS
Line_788	I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
Line_789	BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKIES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
Line_790	HE DEVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISST ITS AIME
Line_791	WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKIES AND THY WERE POARING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
Line_792	SAIS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SUCESSH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BAND MARCH I SAY
Line_793	THE FETTERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHFILL THE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
Line_794	HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROWN
Line_795	THE LEADDEN HAIL STORMS SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFORMED
Line_796	I CALL LUTENANT CURNAL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKIES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKIES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME IN OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
Line_797	I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABEDAT MY GUN
Line_798	OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED THE KNIGHT ATTACK
Line_799	I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
Line_800	I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
Line_801	MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
Line_802	HE WAS STONED DEAD BUT I DROPPED AT FOOT QUICK
Line_803	OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MERFEREY'S BURROW
Line_804	THE PRIVATE GOOD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
Line_805	OKLY COLLAR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENESSY REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEY LINE WITH HIS COLLARS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
Line_806	WE CEPT FALLING BACK AND REFIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEIVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
Line_807	WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKY LINE ON THE WILCARASOMN TURNPIKE
Line_808	WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
Line_809	WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
Line_810	I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND E WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
Line_811	I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
Line_812	FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGUMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
Line_813	THE ANKY PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
Line_814	LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKEY SIDE
Line_815	SHILOW
Line_816	ON MUNDAY MORNING I TOO HAVE CAPTURED ME A MEUL
Line_817	IT WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONSET
Line_818	I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MEAL AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS KNOW
Line_819	THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
Line_820	THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROUPS
Line_821	ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMAR'S BREGADE RELIEIVED GLADENS
Line_822	AN MY TAKING THE ROAPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOAKES BUT YOU ARE A LEADL TOO SMART
Line_823	THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESY GIVE IM A HAL COLUMBIA
Line_824	ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
Line_825	OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MAN TO KEEP IN LINE
Line_826	THE ROAP HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MEUL'S KNOW AND HE WAS FINLLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROAP TO CROSS THE CREAK
Line_827	WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIHTING ALL DAY
Line_828	ON MUNDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
Line_829	I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANEAN AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLE TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STRUN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
Line_830	SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROAP TIED ONE END AROUND THE MEUL'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CASE ON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIPP UP
Line_831	SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
Line_832	I DID NOT PRETEND TO TELL AT WHAT COMMAND DESTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEEROWS OF BLOOD AND WOUNS OF SHREAKS AND GRONS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANEN CAPTURED AT CETTERA
Line_833	WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMARBRGAIDE
Line_834	MEULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS KNOSE
Line_835	ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPFED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFETERATE LINES
Line_836	BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTAMETON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
Line_837	AS GLADEN ROAD BY US A CUREIER ROAT UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
Line_838	I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THEY ORDER DE CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
Line_839	A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
Line_840	BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MENETALKE AND HIS FORISTS
Line_841	SPRING CAME IN PAS AND THEN SUMER
Line_842	THREE DAYS LATER MINNETALKEY BECAME NEUSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
Line_843	ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEAT ROD AT SPRUISEWOOD ON THE BLACK STERGIAN RIVER
Line_844	NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIMB MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
Line_845	ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCOR OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WALBIGAINE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE OBDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
Line_846	CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOUR FATHERS WHILE MINNATALKEY AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELYNESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WELTH OF SOFT GET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LITER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
Line_847	WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
Line_848	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NUSOM INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINATALKE
Line_849	THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
Line_850	WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCOUP TAKEN
Line_851	ONE OF NEWSOM'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAN BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINATALKE AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
Line_852	A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOUNGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
Line_853	BUT THIS POWER OF DESERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
Line_854	WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROYT IN THREE YEARS
Line_855	CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTORY SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPED SCHOOLS
Line_856	BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABY WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINETALKE AND TO HIS FORISTS
Line_857	FROM THAT OUR DATED ONE OFTHE MOST SANGUINARY FUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
Line_858	WABY ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCKOSSENS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINUY AND AGILE AS A LINK AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
Line_859	THE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEET OF WABY'S LETTER FOUND ROAD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WORRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
Line_860	MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNIAN OF NUSOM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
Line_861	THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPLES AND BY THE TIME WABY WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNATALKEY TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANOR OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VAINS
Line_862	IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME I THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPRIDATIONS
Line_863	THREE WEEKS LATER CAME A BIGAHAUN'S REPLY
Line_864	AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINTIAL GOVERMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
Line_865	MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
Line_866	HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICLANTIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD ERTH FRAGMENTS OF LOAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGERS ON THE HIGH WAY OF LIFE
Line_867	I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TUTCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SENTAR
Line_868	A FEW STRAKE HOUSAND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
Line_869	SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
Line_870	I SHOULD HAVE A VILENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXURSIZE
Line_871	HAUNDS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVEARRYING STEP
Line_872	HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANZSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
Line_873	I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDER WAS TO BE FOUND
Line_874	BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO WAIT
Line_875	I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRICIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FIORDFORE THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEE AT ITS HIGIEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
Line_876	THESE SACRED ETIFISES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
Line_877	LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTICALE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNIFFELES WHERE AGLAMORATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CAYOS
Line_878	TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME OBSIURD
Line_879	WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPRAT EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
Line_880	IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELIGENCE THAN THEIRS
Line_881	WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
Line_882	I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXILIERATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
Line_883	THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
Line_884	OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WIP OR SPEER
Line_885	GIEOGREFERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST CQORTER WHICH IN THE VENACULAR IS CALLED SUEDVEST FEORTENGER
Line_886	IT CONSIST SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
Line_887	AT LENGTH THE STIRTY LITTLE PONEY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDECROUS ATITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSIS OF ROADS
Line_888	ACCOUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAME FERRY BOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG ORS OF THE BOATMAN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMMOTION
Line_889	THE PROFESSER KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
Line_890	THEN WITHOUT FIRTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWATED US
Line_891	ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BORD THE GOOD SHIP VULCARY
Line_892	THE FACT IS THE CASTAL AS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROWIC PRINCE OF DENDMARK
Line_893	ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SITED KAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MIDDRALS YOKEL WHICH THE WETHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
Line_894	WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUEGE OF HORIS WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
Line_895	NEARELY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
Line_896	HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A SIVELE SERVANT A MAGISTRAT THE GOVERNER OF THE ILAND BARRAN TRAMP
Line_897	MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOUDY AND DISATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GOST OF HAMLET
Line_898	THE VULCARYE CEPT OFF THE COST STEARING TO THE WESTWARD
Line_899	I HAVE NOT THE SLITEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYENCE OF THE PASTER AND CONGREGATION
Line_900	THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
Line_901	NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOS WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
Line_902	BUT NO GOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
Line_903	THE FACT WAS THAT SCARSELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIOTICAL VESSLE
Line_904	WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
Line_905	ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WAILS AND SHARKS
Line_906	NO MISTER HARDWEIG SAID THE CAPTIN NO FEAR OF THAT
Line_907	VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SUCNUSM
Line_908	THE MEAN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXCILES OF A HIERE SCAL IN THE LATER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESCOMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPPERIOR PROCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
Line_909	THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR SENTURIES
Line_910	IN THE MEAN TIME THERE IS NOT AN OUR TO LOOSE
Line_911	I SAW BUT FEW INHABITENTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROUD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPALE ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
Line_912	I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
Line_913	THIS MODEST SCOLLER SPOKE NO LANGUEGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATEN
Line_914	THANKS TO THE HEET OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY COUT FOR HAY
Line_915	BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
Line_916	AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
Line_917	TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFY AN THAN HE GOS ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWERSHOP JAB
Line_918	RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAIS HOW COME YOURE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
Line_919	AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WOURRY IT
Line_920	I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SOTA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH
Line_921	SOME HOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE IS IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHACES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE IS NOT BISZY SLEEPING
Line_922	YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANY WAY
Line_923	I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAIS HILDA
Line_924	I TURN OFF THE TELIVISIAN SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRAND FATHER WHO S A SPOKE AFTER ALL
Line_925	I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
Line_926	PAP IT'S A COURSE
Line_927	SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SHERE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASMA
Line_928	I EXPLAINED THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BYOLOGY ALGBAR ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS
Line_929	SO HE CARES HE
Line_930	YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
Line_931	WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANEX TO KATES CAT HOME
Line_932	HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN AROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
Line_933	IT'S YOUR FOLT MO IT UP YOURSELF
Line_934	THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
Line_935	I HEAR THE TEVY GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POPP TURNS IT OFF AND GOS IN THE CITCHION TO TALK TO MAUMB
Line_936	TOMSOS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
Line_937	BESIDES SAIS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOURE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE
Line_938	SOMETIMES ROLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THE'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HE
Line_939	I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREEDHE
Line_940	HERES TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
Line_941	IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
Line_942	WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURNAGUIZSED TEBY PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITH OUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
Line_943	I'LL HAFE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAIS TALM
Line_944	PUMP GOES RIGHT ON TOONING HIS CHANNEL
Line_945	I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
Line_946	THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPACIANT OF THE SMALLEST SENTURE AND INSACIABLE OF PRAIZE
Line_947	IF I APPLOAWED THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITENTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FIN THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
Line_948	CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
Line_949	THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONXST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
Line_950	I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE REED OVE REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DIMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELIMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
Line_951	I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARRISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRID
Line_952	IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOL OBJECT WHICH HE UNSEASINGLY PERSUS BUT AMONGXST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTANCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THIS SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY HOLY FORRON TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
Line_953	THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON WEALTH ARE HOLLY ENGROSED BY THE ACQUASITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUON
Line_954	THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURIL GELOISSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MAN OF DIMOCRCIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARAD OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSESSION
Line_955	AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEASURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS COWLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUGH OUT THE GREATER PART OF YUROUP SHOUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
Line_956	THEY STAND UN MOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
Line_957	THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAME OF VANTING PRIVILAGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFISCIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPPICS OF CONVERSATION
Line_958	IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSESS EMMENSE PRIVILAGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH CRUSHEDEM
Line_959	WHERE AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HOUGTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
Line_960	IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FIN ONE I HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
Line_961	IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BIRSTS OF TUMOLTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYIETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES AND DIMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VILENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND HEY NEVER LOOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
Line_962	MY GRAND MOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FORENERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAH
Line_963	THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN CAKES AND SORGAM MALASIS FOR THREE DAYS
Line_964	HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLLAR
Line_965	IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRETS I REMEMBER IN VERGINIA

Line_996	WITH THE INSIDE OF A KINDRED TEMPRIMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
Line_997	MISTER VERLOCK WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
Line_998	THERE WAS AN EXTRORDINARY FOURSE OF SUGJESTION IN THIS POSTRING
Line_999	HE TOOK THE CASH BOCKS OUT F THE DROAR AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEEVY WAS STILL DOWN STARS

Line_1013	MISTER VERLOCK PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEEVY
Line_1014	THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TORRIST AS IF RUTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

Line_1208	IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HELTH AND CALFED VILENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME INSPIGHT OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
Line_1209	IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
Line_1210	I HAVE ALWAYS DELITED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDED TIPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EAGIPTION GREEK AND ETALLIAN

Line_1213	EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COUMLY AND THE OLD GREAT HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SA MAGUESTY OF THEIR OWN
Line_1214	THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELESSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
Line_1215	THE VINE GRURE OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SINEBORDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
Line_1216	THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMAN BEAUTIFUL
Line_1217	THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY COLTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESNOUTS WALLNOUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING

Line_1219	THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONG THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TON QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
Line_1220	AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRAGE WHOSE WEALS INSPIGHT OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESINED ORIGINALLY FOR IURN RAILS
Line_1221	THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
Line_1222	THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
Line_1223	THE CHILDREN WERE INFINATE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MARRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
Line_1224	THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE ERTHLY
Line_1225	EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EILIDS EILASSHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVERIABLY PERFECT
Line_1226	MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLIGHTNESS F THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIANCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP YING ME NOR I THEM
Line_1227	SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPPLES WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
Line_1228	I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIORATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
Line_1229	I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
Line_1230	THE DESINE WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
Line_1231	SUFFICED THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRAT AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APPARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
Line_1232	ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVIZES TO THE PRINTER
Line_1233	THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
Line_1234	I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINELY TO TWO EARLY FAVERABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PAUMALGASETT OF APRIL TWELFHTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATER OF APRIL TWENTIETH
Line_1235	THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPPY RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS

Line_1237	I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EROWIE THAT WERE REPEATEDLY RERITTEN BUT FROME THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE RIGTING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COOD
Line_1238	THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN REEDING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS INSPIHT OF THEIR ENTIRE INDIPENDEANCE TO ONE ANOTHER
Line_1239	I ALSO ROAT ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ALTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRILE OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
Line_1240	PREFS TO THE SECOND ADDITION
Line_1241	I MADE A FEW FIRTHER VERY TRIFULING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW ADDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STARIOS THEN MADE
Line_1242	I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINSER THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREETED MY ADVENTURES
Line_1243	THE FIRST ADDITION OF IROINE SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOLDS AND AS THE DIMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
Line_1244	IT WAS RITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGATADA DISTRICT OF THE CANABARY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEWSELAND AND APPEARED AT CRIST CHERCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUON THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
Line_1245	THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUS
Line_1246	BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF RECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
Line_1247	I SEE FOR MY SECOND PREFASS THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MISSURS CHAPMAN AN HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS OPTAINED THE HIEST RANK AMONG LIVING RIHTERS I LEAD IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBENER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO

Line_1504	HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR KERRY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
Line_1505	THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
Line_1506	HE WAS IN A FEAVERED STAIT OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
Line_1507	HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANY HOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW

Line_1608	NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTORDINARY PREDELECTION FOR THE NAME MAGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
Line_1609	I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASIONED CRISMESSES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A SHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB WHERE MY COUSON LUSCE'S KNOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLES THE FESTIVE SEASON
Line_1610	IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
Line_1611	NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLADGE WAS ABOUT A HALF A MILE AND HANGARDEAN THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOWD FIELDS MY INFORMENT DID NOT MENTION
Line_1612	BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
Line_1613	I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
Line_1614	I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
Line_1615	THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFAL OD
Line_1616	THE IMFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMONLY LIKE A COURESS OF LAFTER
Line_1617	THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
Line_1618	AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTONING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDEL IN HER HAND
Line_1619	I HAD NO ELUSIONS
Line_1620	MAY BE THERE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
Line_1621	I MISTER CRISTOF HER FROM LUNDON
Line_1622	IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE IS WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SAID TO PLAY IN IT
Line_1623	IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
Line_1624	FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
Line_1625	SOMEONE SNIGERED
Line_1626	WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARRY AN SHE ROAT AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HUNNEYMOON IN HER COTTEGE OR PIGSTIE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
Line_1627	HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
Line_1628	AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
Line_1629	HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR GERNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COOPONS FOR FREE BORD AND LODGING AT THE HOTELL IT'S A WEADDING PRESENT
Line_1630	SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
Line_1631	IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
Line_1632	I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO AUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY AUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FOLT IF I DON'T GET IT
Line_1633	A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BOOSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
Line_1634	HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
Line_1635	WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HUNEYMON TO ITILY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
Line_1636	THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
Line_1637	SHE HAS A NACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIERACULIS
Line_1638	OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CANT BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
Line_1639	A SECOND COUSEN OF MARRIENS IS IN THE COOK'S TOOERS LINE
Line_1640	I KNOW WHAT MAMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES IT
Line_1641	BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COOPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T YOUSE
Line_1642	THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARRIAN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RENCOROS ASCIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
Line_1643	WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARRY AN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WIDING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
Line_1644	BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELBLINGS
Line_1645	I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE ITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLY EST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARRY ANS THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
Line_1646	THE GIRL IS FREADDING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
Line_1647	I SHALL MAKE POPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
Line_1648	I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
Line_1649	AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHERKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS ITHER
Line_1650	FROM A COUSEN OF OURS WHO IS IN THAT LINE
Line_1651	I CAN NOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNEBLINGS MOVE
Line_1652	IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPITION SPRINGS
Line_1653	I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSEN GOT A PROPHET OUT OF MARRIAN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HAND IT OVER THE AMOUNT
Line_1654	AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MICK FERSON HAS MARRIAN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
Line_1655	IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFTERBLLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
Line_1656	THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION ACCERED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
Line_1657	THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MICK FERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
Line_1658	I NEVER SAW A PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINEDS
Line_1659	THERE SHE OWNS A COTTEAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTIE FOR ALL INOW
Line_1660	THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
Line_1661	AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
Line_1662	BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITTY ME I ALTOGETHER FAILE TO UNDERSTAND
Line_1663	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
Line_1664	PEES THE CARS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
Line_1665	I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
Line_1666	I RUBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
Line_1667	HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISEN HIM
Line_1668	NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
Line_1669	TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTORNAL ORGIY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OVE
Line_1670	AS FOR THE UCARIST TRAND SUBSTANCHIATION THE REAL PRESENTS IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT POLPABLE EVIDENTS AND YET THEY WERE NOT GESUITS
Line_1671	WHERE IS MY HOUSBAND
Line_1672	BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECUATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARO INTELECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
Line_1673	THERE WAS NO COWERDLY TRAITER AMONXST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTERNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
Line_1674	I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GANDOLLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
Line_1675	THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODUST SILENCE
Line_1676	YOUR PARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOSE YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GANDOLLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEEQUINS A MONTH
Line_1677	IF THE QUESTION WAS SO AOBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
Line_1678	WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
Line_1679	UNWILLING TO HERT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSESSED A CERTAIN NUMORAL CALCULIS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKE TO PUT
Line_1680	I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEME NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUPING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECLEASIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIEST SOCIETY
Line_1681	THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CRISTIONS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHERCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEAS AND FULL OF SCROUPLES
Line_1682	BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORICLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DOVELE AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
Line_1683	I OBAYED IMPLICITELY AND MET YOUR EXCOLENCY
Line_1684	YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
Line_1685	HE INTREETED ME TO TELL HIM THE TROUTH
Line_1686	BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFISSIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS AND GENERAL
Line_1687	HE ROAT THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT T ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
Line_1688	THE WAITER OF THE MAGASIENO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DO ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENELTY OF DEATH
Line_1689	YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
Line_1690	I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HIPOCRESY AND I SHOULD HAVEBEEN DISPICCKABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTAL ON MY SHOLDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIOUS
Line_1691	AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPARED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
Line_1692	MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FATHE
Line_1693	WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXCECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINATE PRACTICAL JOKS
Line_1694	IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PERRISHES OF THE CITY OF VENUS THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGASIENOL
Line_1695	THE FESITION WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A METURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
Line_1696	THEY ALL ASK ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULS OF MY SUBLIME CALCULIS
Line_1697	WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOT
Line_1698	I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISH TO FOLLOW THE RULS OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT ITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTEMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
Line_1699	WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME ENTELEGENCE WHICH GOOD LITERARY AND SIENTIFHIC NOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALLENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRETY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
Line_1700	I JUMPED OUT OF THE GANDOLLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RIZETA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFY HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
Line_1701	THEY BELIEVE THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSESSED THE PHILOSOFERSTONE THE UNIVERSAL PANNECEIA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELIMENTORY HEVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANXS TO MY SUBLIME SIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERMENT IN YUROUP
Line_1702	DELITED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
Line_1703	WE DID THE SAME WITH PFISITIONS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCOLENT HELTH
Line_1704	I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRASEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
Line_1705	OUR SCANDELISS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
Line_1706	THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
Line_1707	WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES ACCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
Line_1708	THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
Line_1709	NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED ANT I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH AL THOUGH THE HURMET ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DYE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SIENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PRODICTION
Line_1710	TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A FESITION WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIANT TO BE BLOOD AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
Line_1711	I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
Line_1712	I THROUW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND IMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
Line_1713	THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
Line_1714	WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHERCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PEARRISH BY RINGING THE ALLARME BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELLROAPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHERCHWORDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMINING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
Line_1715	BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC MUSIC THAT HAS MELOIDY AND RITHEM AND SOUTHING CATDENCES GO TO THE HEITELEBERGIN AND LISTEN TO THE CONSORT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING
Line_1716	SAN FRANCISCO'S CAREFRY SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF NINETEEN O SIX WERE COLD

Line_1736	IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT
Line_1737	HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROUD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEIATER OURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DOMENTIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS

Line_1828	AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_1829	IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISSWERIBLE HAS IT
Line_1830	ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
Line_1831	YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
Line_1832	YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WISPERED
Line_1833	YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
Line_1834	I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILES THE OTHER
Line_1835	AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLLER FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
Line_1836	HELDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
Line_1837	SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
Line_1838	SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WORENT YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
Line_1839	SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUSHED FORWARD LIKE A CATIPOLED IN LEACH
Line_1840	SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
Line_1841	COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
Line_1842	SOMETHING OF THEIR CHUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXZANDER TOO
Line_1843	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_1844	IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORCURES ME EVERY MINUTE
Line_1845	AFTER THE VERY FIRST
Line_1846	IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BRAKE HILDA
Line_1847	I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
Line_1848	HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
Line_1849	WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
Line_1850	SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
Line_1851	HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER CHEMBELING AND SCARSELY BREETING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
Line_1852	IMMERGING AT EUSTERN AT HALF PAST THREE ACCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SEVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUAR
Line_1853	SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
Line_1854	A COL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
Line_1855	SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
Line_1856	I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
Line_1857	AND I SHE WISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
Line_1858	I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LUNDON
Line_1859	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'LD BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T ARN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
Line_1860	IF YOULD SENT ME A KNOT OR TELIFONE TO ME OR ANYTHING
Line_1861	THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
Line_1862	ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
Line_1863	YES I KNOW VERY WELL
Line_1864	HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
Line_1865	ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
Line_1866	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT
Line_1867	HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
Line_1868	OVER THE FIRE PLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
Line_1869	BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
Line_1870	ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSIY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINERE HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
Line_1871	I'VE BEEN UP IN CANIDA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
Line_1872	OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OW ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SALE ON TOOSDAY
Line_1873	OH BARTLY DID YOU RIGHT TO ME
Line_1874	I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
Line_1875	ALEXZANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
Line_1876	HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
Line_1877	LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THE'RE OOSING WATER
Line_1878	I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
Line_1879	I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
Line_1880	IN THEIR EYES JESS OF NASERATH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEAGITIMATE SON OF JOSIF AND MARRY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISZEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRMENTS TO RESTOR UPON EARTH THE WORSHIOP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEETY
Line_1881	YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS A POLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLINATION
Line_1882	NORE COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE EIONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ARROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
Line_1883	THE SON OF A VERGIAN GENERATED BY THE INEFABLE OPPERATION OF THE WHOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLENCE SUPERIORE IN EVERY ATTRBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
Line_1884	THEIR MURMORS WERE VEARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTORIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SISTOM OF CARENTHIUS
Line_1885	HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN KIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRETIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DIVOATED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTIS AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HEROW MAY DISDAINE THE HUMBLE VIRTUS OF JESIS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHEAD OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
Line_1886	HE ACQUEIESSED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOFERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENCATIVE SOL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOWGOS FOR INTILECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPAL IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
Line_1887	A LAUWDBLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELEIGHTE HAS COUNTENANCEDS THE BELIEFE THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIANIGHTS OR AT LEAST THE NASORINS WERE DESTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAYIC RIGHTS
Line_1888	WHEN THE MESSIA WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE GEES THE CRISET AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FOR SOOK HIS ERTHLY TABERNACL FLEW BACK TO THE PLARAMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY GESES TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
Line_1889	UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABET SERAPIAN HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATICABLE ARDER THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PORUSED THE FOUR GOSPLES THE CATHOLIC APPISSALS AND THEAPPISSAL TO THE ROMANS
Line_1890	THE WORTHY FRIEND OF APHENASIS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY RESCTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGER OF GEAMETRICAL DEMINSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
Line_1891	THEIR CHERCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FATHE AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFINT CREED WOULD BE VERIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE SEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
Line_1892	BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLYIENCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WEASILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANCAL INDESOLLIABLE AND EVERLASTING YUNIAN OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOL AND HUMAN FLESH
Line_1893	MANY AMONG THE GENTIL PROSOLIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A SELESTIAL SPIRIT AND UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR SEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY OBDURED THE HUMANITY OF CRIST
Line_1894	YET THE MOST CHERRITIBLE CRITISISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTORIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CRIST
Line_1895	HIS PROGRESS FROM INFENCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREECE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
Line_1896	BUT THE JUSTIESS AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FAT OF AN INNOCENT MARTER AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITTY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFAINE
Line_1897	A FEDIS THAT COULD INCRECE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAINE THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DRIVING ANY NURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SORSES MIGHT CONTINU TO EXIST WITHOUT REPARING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
Line_1898	BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRIN OF THE ATURNITY AND ENHEARENT PRAVETY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMETIVE CHERCHES OF THE EAST
Line_1899	HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JEORDEN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPETENCE TO IMITATE THE FACOLTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ELUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
Line_1900	BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCORRAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CRISTE WAS A FANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIABLE AND INCORRUPTABLE BODY
Line_1901	RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPARE THE MISCHIF AND SCANDEL OF YOUR MEETING
Line_1902	WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARK AT THE DAWN OF THE DAY LEAD A SEDITIOUS MOLTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SCINNEGOGS
Line_1903	BUT THE VATICON RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MASSANGERS OF EGIPT
Line_1904	A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEAMIES OR NUBIANS INVATED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREET THEY DISMISSED A CROUD OF YOUSELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD MISTERIOUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NIL THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AN ORTHEDOCX'S CITY TO THE MILD OR SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
Line_1905	THE VANITY OF KELLISTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARCIAL VERSIAN OF A MUNK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POP WHO WITH HIS LATTOIN CLERGY WAS IGNORENT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
Line_1906	EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERITICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
Line_1907	AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVEINIEW OF THE THROWN WAS ASSELTED WITH GOLD
Line_1908	SIXTY EIGHT BISHOUPS TWENTY TWO OF METRAPOLITIAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODUST AND TEMPORATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHERIN
Line_1909	THIS DEAL OF CARL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENELTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAIYZE
Line_1910	THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISSENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS OWN POPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECRECED THE NUMBER OF THE SKISMATICS WHO REVEARED MISTORIOUS AS THE CONFESSER OF THE FATHE
Line_1911	AT THESE BLASTFORMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
Line_1912	BY THE VIGULENCE OF MEMBNONE THE CHERCHES WERE SHOT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL
Line_1913	ARDENT IN THE PREORSECUTION OF HERISY KCERIL OUSPITIOUSLY OPENED HIS RAIN BY OPPRESSING THE NAVATIONS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF SECTORIES
Line_1914	ARESTIAS COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THE ADOSIOUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PREFECT OF EAJIPT
Line_1915	THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIOUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAIED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE UNICS AND WOMEN OF THE PALLIS SUPERSTITION AND AVERIS WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHEDOQXS CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEVERS TO ALLARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
Line_1916	BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHERCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERCEEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY
Line_1917	WHICH OPPRESSED THE METRAPOLITAINS OF YUROUP AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOKAN ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DISIS BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
Line_1918	NISTORIOUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS ESTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDOCESSER CRISESTOM TO DISCLAME THE JERISTICTION AND TO DISOBAY THE SUMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE CEET OF JUDGMENT
Line_1919	SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMETE VERSIAN OF THE MAGISTRAT BUT IN THIS PERMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLINY
Line_1920	DURING A BISZY PERIAD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPORER TRIED EVERY METHOD ACCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONSIL THIS THIOLOGICAL QUARRAL
Line_1921	A ROUMER WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CRISTIONS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTICLE TO THE RECONSILIATION OF THE PREFECT AND THE ARCH BISHOUP AND THAT OBSTICLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED
Line_1922	HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUISID
Line_1923	ONNUST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAIED HERE FOR YEARS
Line_1924	HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFTERBLE CHAT
Line_1925	WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEETS AT THE BRECKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
Line_1926	AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEET WATER STOLL A GLANCE AT MISTER GRICE
Line_1927	THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
Line_1928	WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LABE BELOW
Line_1929	AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
Line_1930	I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
Line_1931	SWEET WATER SOME ONE DRUW THAT WEAPON OUT
Line_1932	AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMITION
Line_1933	JUST AN EVERY DAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOUROW
Line_1934	I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
Line_1935	A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HUVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPED FORWARD
Line_1936	IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
Line_1937	GEORGE NODDED
Line_1938	WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SEEN SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LABY
Line_1939	THE TIME IS NERROWED DOWN TO UN AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKS WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TUTCH HER
Line_1940	NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
Line_1941	HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREEDING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
Line_1942	NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
Line_1943	YES MANY TIMES
Line_1944	IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRICE
Line_1945	A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORDEOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
Line_1946	NO DOUBT
Line_1947	WHERE EVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CANT WALK FAR
Line_1948	THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVES BUNDLED UP LAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
Line_1949	INSTANTLY THEY OBSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DEARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
Line_1950	THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOER
Line_1951	I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
Line_1952	WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
Line_1953	YES MISTER SLATER AT THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LUBY AT THE TIME SAIS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
Line_1954	SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PERPOSE WHICH LEAD HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORSE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
Line_1955	NO WORD NO CRIY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
Line_1956	I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
Line_1957	THERE WAS NO POIARD IN THE WOUND
Line_1958	IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
Line_1959	YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
Line_1960	SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
Line_1961	WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRICE
Line_1962	DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHELENER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
Line_1963	YES HE'S MORE CURIORL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
Line_1964	WELL WELL THAT'S ONNUST AT ALL EVENTS
Line_1965	THEIR GREETING WAS CORGIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELACXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EY OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIENCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
Line_1966	I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OVE AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
Line_1967	HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLERNMENT FOR HIM

Line_1971	BENT OVER THE GROUND STUDDYED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
Line_1972	IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
Line_1973	VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
Line_1974	NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I WAS SHOULD SAY
Line_1975	THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
Line_1976	THE BOYS LOOK WITE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
Line_1977	WHAT DOES HE WANT
Line_1978	HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
Line_1979	THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR ANT
Line_1980	BUT VIGUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRITT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELIVATER
Line_1981	THE NEXT MINUT SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
Line_1982	ING KNOW WH IT SOUNDS FULLISH BUT THE ALTURNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
Line_1983	YES
Line_1984	BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
Line_1985	BUT NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
Line_1986	THIS SWEET WATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTAGAS AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVERET
Line_1987	JHEORGE
Line_1988	IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBEY AND THERE IT ITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND

Line_1991	ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
Line_1992	THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR

Line_1995	I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FIRTIVE WATCHER
Line_1996	VERY WELL THEN YOURE IN A POSITION TO PIRNEARE ME

Line_1998	ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSITIOANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
Line_1999	OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
Line_2000	I EMPASIZED COMPLACANTLY
Line_2001	THERE WAS NO DOUTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE

Line_2003	BUT IAM IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISSES
Line_2004	BUT CLOUS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
Line_2005	I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
Line_2006	FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUT BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSITIOAN'S GALORY
Line_2007	HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRICE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD AND SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFELING PROBLIMS AS THESE
Line_2008	MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENTS PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUARRIED MUSINGLY
Line_2009	IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BULT FROM HEAVEN
Line_2010	MARK SOWERBY AND CLOSE HENTERBERG
Line_2011	NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MESONIEN WHAT FOLLOWS
Line_2012	THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHERRIET TRIUMPFAL ON TWO WEALS WHICH BY A GRIFFN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
Line_2013	BY HIS DEFALT SHORT WHILE HE SURJERNED HERE BY HIS DEFALT TO WEAPING AND TO TOILE HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAFTER AND SWEET PLAY
Line_2014	YOU KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NORE NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
Line_2015	TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIENCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
Line_2016	THE GOOD SUPREME SOL IN ITSELF DELITING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDFL OF ETERNAL PIECE
Line_2017	AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELITS ONWARD GOW LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNENS HAD THE SEMBLENCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DESTINCT WITH SEVEN FOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLLARS WHENCE THE SON'S BOW IS MADE AND DIALLIA'S GIRDL

Line_2019	DOUNTAY BECAUSE VIRDILLIOUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEAP YET DO NOT WEAP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEADST MUST WEAP
Line_2020	SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLYENCES FOR HIS SELVATION WERE ALL READY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PRODITION
Line_2021	BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE OURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BOR A BURDEN TO THEIR RIMES
Line_2022	BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGIONS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
Line_2023	TO SAY UNTO VERDILLIOUS NOT A DRAHUM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
Line_2024	THIS EVERY OTHER SAVER DOTH TRANSEND AND NOT WITH STANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
Line_2025	THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEAPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOL BE OF ONE MEASURE
Line_2026	THESE STANDERDS TO THE REAR WORD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTER MOST APPART
Line_2027	I DO NOT THINK THERE SHOWN SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENIUS WHEN TRANS FIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL COUSTOM
Line_2028	LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOUTH IM BEATRIS
Line_2029	THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WEAL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY READ THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
Line_2030	NORE EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
Line_2031	THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHEARE AND WHAT BROSAPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
Line_2032	IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREETED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GATE EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
Line_2033	AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
Line_2034	BUT BY THE LARSZES OF SUELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LAOUGFTY VAPERS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
Line_2035	I SAW THE LADY WHO AIR WHILE APPEARED VALED UNDERNETH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
Line_2036	AND WHAT ALARMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOT STEPS UNTO THEM
Line_2037	CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
Line_2038	NOW HALECONE MUST NEEDS POORE FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER QUIERE YEARANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICLT TO THINK
Line_2039	AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERGITED
Line_2040	THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMROLD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN

Line_2341	BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
Line_2342	WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANEY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOOM

Line_2346	BUT LIVING SOL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEAT
Line_2347	WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
Line_2348	SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
Line_2349	SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOULING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
Line_2350	IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLLARS AND OADERS
Line_2351	ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
Line_2352	IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RALWAY CARRIAGE
Line_2353	AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
Line_2354	AND YESTERDAY HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
Line_2355	HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUE BELLS AND SHE SHOULD HVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
Line_2356	AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEE AND HIS NATURAL IMPLSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMATY THAT EROR
Line_2357	NOW IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
Line_2358	SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM ALEARICK IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOWS
Line_2359	YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRIST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDERD POWETS AND OF THE CHEEPER WEAKLY GERNALS
Line_2360	DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW
Line_2361	THE KEAN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
Line_2362	COULDN'T HELP IT THAN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
Line_2363	SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COKED IT IS
Line_2364	HER HANDS AND FEET WERE AKING WITH COLD
Line_2365	SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER REEDING AND HER ENVIRMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
Line_2366	SO HE INLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDDTLES AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLINATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
Line_2367	I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOD OVER IT ALL
Line_2368	FOLLOWING THE TINKLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKONING PENCH OF GELISSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
Line_2369	I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN ITTIAT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
Line_2370	AND HE STROED DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXET

Line_2374	A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPEARED WITH HER FEARS
Line_2375	BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT ACCEARED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
Line_2376	WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNECENCE OF HER SOL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEAPLY
Line_2377	HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT

Line_2465	THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT SOHNVELSOHN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
Line_2466	COSETT WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MORNING
Line_2467	NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GOLPH BETWEEN SOHNVELSOHN AND COSETT DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GOLPH
Line_2468	AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PREY
Line_2469	THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
Line_2470	HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
Line_2471	ALAST HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETT
Line_2472	WHEN THESE TWO SOLS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
Line_2473	HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
Line_2474	WEAK FOLLOWED WEAK THESE TWO BEINGS LEAD A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
Line_2475	HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
Line_2476	ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFABLE LIGHT
Line_2477	BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH
Line_2478	AND ALL READY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTORIES OF DISPARE AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
Line_2479	IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POWETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITTERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDENT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESORSES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IN TO DAY
Line_2480	WHAT ALTURNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER
Line_2481	WE NEVER PLANED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET
Line_2482	IN MARRY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMPD OVE LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSESSION
Line_2483	HOW WE MUST SYMPLIFY
Line_2484	YOU WERE RONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE CEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU
Line_2485	AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL GELISIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGED INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS RIDING
Line_2486	IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTON
Line_2487	IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING
Line_2488	IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUTER AND MORE RIGED CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NIEVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
Line_2489	SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISSIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST CREDITION THAT SUSTAINES AND INFORSES THE SUBJEGATION OF HER SEX
Line_2490	WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
Line_2491	FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARRY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN
Line_2492	I BECAME GROTESKCALY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGH OUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER

Line_2512	I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEETH THE APL BOW AND YOU SHALL DREAM ON THE LAWN SO SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY OH MY APL GOLD LADY
Line_2513	YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
Line_2514	THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
Line_2515	IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHAMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
Line_2516	FOR AMBROSH MY MAMA COME HERE
Line_2517	YOU HAVE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
Line_2518	THE WEEK FOLLOWING CRISMSS BROUGHT IN A THAWH AND BY NEW YEARS DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROATH OF GRAY SLUSHE AND THE GUDTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
Line_2519	BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRATES POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN HIM
Line_2520	THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
Line_2521	HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TUTCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
Line_2522	BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONSERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STARS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
Line_2523	HOW INFINAT THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GUARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TRESURE HOUSES AND OH
Line_2524	BEFORE CRISMUSS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOLK COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL EVEN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
Line_2525	THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KAN PRACTICAL SHRUDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FULLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SYMENS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
Line_2526	I CAN NOT THINK WHAT POSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWN CAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
Line_2527	MARGRET MET JEMWILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
Line_2528	HER CRIYES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS AKING HEART TO COMFORT HERSE
Line_2529	OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREEITHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
Line_2530	MARRY I ALMOST LOTH MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PASSED AND GONE AND MARRY AS SHE TRIED TO RELIECE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
Line_2531	BUT WILL HE SANK BEFORE IT
Line_2532	IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER ONE SCOLDED BY MISS SYMMENS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESS MAKER
Line_2533	MARRY AND ALLIS DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
Line_2534	IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
Line_2535	BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLYEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEAMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DIS HEARTENED BLOOMY PERSON
Line_2536	HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JIM'S MANNER IN WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TAIL THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
Line_2537	DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
Line_2538	THE OLD LEVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNTESTER FORMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTAL
Line_2539	BUT HE STAIED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STIRTY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
Line_2540	SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
Line_2541	WISHING HIM SAID MARRY IN A TONE OF INQURY
Line_2542	SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DESTERB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALLIS LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BORD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFASATE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
Line_2543	THEN ALLIS BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
Line_2544	HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTILL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARRY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRYING GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK OUR
Line_2545	OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
Line_2546	WHAT BANCRUPS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORCELESS CREDITER SEASES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
Line_2547	SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO JEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
Line_2548	I THINK I CAN NOT GO RIGHT FOR I ITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWN RIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
Line_2549	THE GOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BOLKED OF ITS PREY
Line_2550	THE BORD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOK CLAPOL HER HUSBANDS BUCKINGHAM SHIRE PERRISH AS SHE HAD DREADDED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
Line_2551	HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAIED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
Line_2552	ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
Line_2553	HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
Line_2554	HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
Line_2555	HE SAT STILL AND IPPASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
Line_2556	AT ABOUT FOUR ACCLOCK A VISITER APPEARED MISTER SHAMERDA WEARING HIS RABETS KIN CAP IN COLLOER AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD NITDTED
Line_2557	MORNING PRAIRS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
Line_2558	GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHERT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
Line_2559	BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORSE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
Line_2560	SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTAIN CLOTH AND WE SOWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
Line_2561	I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOULCKA AND ANTONIEA EVENYOULCA WAS ABLE TO REED A LITTLE NOW
Line_2562	THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREACING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLATING WHIPLASHES
Line_2563	WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
Line_2564	ANY WAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
Line_2565	FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLLEARED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
Line_2566	I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEAT JAKE
Line_2567	BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE CITING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CRISMESS EAVE
Line_2568	ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTIZING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
Line_2569	HE YUSED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CRISMES TREES FOR ME IN VERGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
Line_2570	I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMP LIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDLY MOLDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOME HOW UNFINISHED ATTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FOROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MOUSTACHE
Line_2571	HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
Line_2572	WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAINE OF THOUGHT
Line_2573	LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
Line_2574	WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
Line_2575	I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
Line_2576	OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
Line_2577	HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEAVERED HEAD
Line_2578	YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
Line_2579	I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
Line_2580	RANDEL WAITED WHILE IN LUNDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
Line_2581	I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
Line_2582	NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENIDICK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SCIDNIY'S INTREST TO MAKE INQUARIES AT HIS CLUB
Line_2583	AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
Line_2584	RANDLE ROAT TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERIN PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
Line_2585	THIS ALTURNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUSLED RANDEL
Line_2586	I WILL DO NITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
Line_2587	YOU CANT DO IT
Line_2588	SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
Line_2589	HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTELL TO TRY THE AIR OF SITENAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
Line_2590	HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
Line_2591	HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTATCHED HIMSELF TO RANDEL AFTER THE BRAKE UP OF THE FAMILY
Line_2592	YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE YUSED TO SEEING A PRITTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
Line_2593	LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEEDED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
Line_2594	HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
Line_2595	I'M AFRAID HE SAID
Line_2596	RANDEL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNY IS
Line_2597	THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLINATION THAN THAT THE CRUS WAS OVER
Line_2598	I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
Line_2599	MISSUS PRESTYE WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTELL
Line_2600	BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUARIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
Line_2601	RANDEL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PAREGRAF
Line_2602	MISSUS KNORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
Line_2603	GOOD BY DEAR RANDEL
Line_2604	ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
Line_2605	THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
Line_2606	WHEN HE AND I HAPPEND TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
Line_2607	IT WAS A RELIEFE TO RANDEL IN THE PRESENT STAT OF CATHERIN'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENEDECK TO RETURN TO LUNDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
Line_2608	BUT IF THESE NEWS PAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER REPORT IS TRUERE FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSEP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVERAT NEWSPAPERS
Line_2609	WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
Line_2610	YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
Line_2611	YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERSY ON HER
Line_2612	HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENYDECK
Line_2613	HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS KNORMAN AND TO MISSUS KNORMANS LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
Line_2614	HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
Line_2615	AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLLMS SPECIALLY DIVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELIGENCE
Line_2616	YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DEVORSE DAUGTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRAND CHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEEL AFTER YOU LEFT US
Line_2617	BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SIDENAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
Line_2618	AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS KNORMAN WAS A WIDOW
Line_2619	NOT AT THE HOTELL JUST NOW
Line_2620	SITT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY
Line_2621	WITH HIS OWN SUSPITIONS STEADILY CONTRODICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTELL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
Line_2622	THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULER WEAKLY GERNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDL BOUGHT IT
Line_2623	ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDEL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SITENAM SO AS TO ARIVE AT THE HOTELL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
Line_2624	AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S ATHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
Line_2625	WRANDEL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
Line_2626	WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNY THE TRAIN FROM LUNDON CAME IN
Line_2627	SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
Line_2628	ONESTLY
Line_2629	A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
Line_2630	SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPITIOUSLY
Line_2631	THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
Line_2632	IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUARIES RAISED AN INSEPPARABLE OBSTICLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
Line_2633	WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
Line_2634	YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTELL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERIN
Line_2635	WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDEL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDED AND TROUTHFUL IN HER CARACTER THEN TO BECOME HIS FRIENDS WIFE
Line_2636	EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENIDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISS SINCE RANDEL'S VISIT TO SITENDAM
Line_2637	HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERIN TO GRANT SIDNY AN INTERVIEW
Line_2638	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
Line_2639	NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSEP IN PRIVET THE GREEDY PUBLIC APETIGHTE DEVOURS GOSEP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE ETITER CAN SUPPLY
Line_2640	HE ADDED CIDNIY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTCRIPT AND DESPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
Line_2641	SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
Line_2642	CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICASY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTMATE FRIEND
Line_2643	BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
Line_2644	BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFUR THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERIN'S REPLY
Line_2645	SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
Line_2646	THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TUNG CAN UTTER
Line_2647	THEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS OAUTUM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
Line_2648	I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SORING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UP LIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
Line_2649	SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILES AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOL COUNTS THE COUST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
Line_2650	VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILCONS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CANT MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SORAL I WILL ON HIS STOMECK AND SEE HOW THATTLE WORK
Line_2651	NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWUILIGHT A TALL MAN AND ARMEY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUAL FIGURUER FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLGIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
Line_2652	NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
Line_2653	EXOLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUAOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
Line_2654	THE LOIAL FRIENSY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
Line_2655	TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LAIN
Line_2656	NOW HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED AN LIZY
Line_2657	I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVE DI NOT HONNOUR MORE
Line_2658	BUT I THINK FEW BROAIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE THE SOBER WETTING GOWN ANSWERED CRISTY SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GREY WOLLEN STUFF
Line_2659	THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
Line_2660	IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY NAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHELERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
Line_2661	HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NERSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
Line_2662	HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND ATTUM WHEN HIS COMRADS IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRICES WITH IRFUL BRANDISHING OF ALS AND VENGFUL POUNDING OF SOL LEATHER AS IF THE REABLES WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
Line_2663	CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPSEY TOLD US AND CALLE THEM POOR LONG SUFFERING CREATURES NAMES
Line_2664	I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
Line_2665	MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
Line_2666	THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELLEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
Line_2667	A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADDOORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND OUT WEADTING BRECKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEACH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVIDS EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP THEM BRING HIM BACK TO US
Line_2668	YOU YOUNG FOKES TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
Line_2669	DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
Line_2670	AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
Line_2671	NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CRISTY
Line_2672	WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE FITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING SO
Line_2673	THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTENT WAS PRECIOUS
Line_2674	BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAME WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
Line_2675	HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVALVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISZE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREETED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCRECED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER INCHIEF AND BOR HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
Line_2676	ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BRATH AND PROUD SOLS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AMBRIGHT WITH A STEALLY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET IN AWAY TO JOIN THE SEE OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBD BACK READDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
Line_2677	DAVID AND CRISTY WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHEAD ANY TIRRISO FOR THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOIALLY CEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
Line_2678	FINDING THAT LICHA SHOWED THE LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VERIOUS SORTS
Line_2679	DAVID CAUGHT THE EXHALTATION AND GAVE NO FIRTHER THOUGHT TO ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK ANTO THE ELUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED

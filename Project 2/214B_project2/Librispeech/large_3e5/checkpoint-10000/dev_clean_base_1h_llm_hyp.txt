Line_130	ERITH WAS GONE AND HEVEN WAS ALL
Line_131	THE MUSICK WAS BROKEN AND JOSIF LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRMENTS
Line_132	HE STARTED TO COUNSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID

Line_140	WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSIF THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTBATH
Line_141	WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMS WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLLORS

Line_143	THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM ASSERPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT SEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
Line_144	IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
Line_145	I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VILE IN AND THE WORSHIP WAS INTREETY THAT KNEW NOT ITSSELF
Line_146	HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIEL IN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PEANO THAT THEN SOME HOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
Line_147	JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SAIR OF US

Line_153	MISTER MORTAIN SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAIVERLY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEANE LEAN
Line_154	HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDSFEAR IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCOMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DESTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIAD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
Line_155	HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY RECHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPITIONS AND HIS INFURANCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUSITION
Line_156	CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT
Line_157	THEY HELD CONVENTBLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE RAIN
Line_158	MISTER MORTAIN THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDOM OF THE VERIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
Line_159	IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
Line_160	EXCLAIMED TRAUT OF COURSE
Line_161	PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILARL'S FACE CLOSELY
Line_162	BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL RONG SAID TORMOLIEN GRAIVELY
Line_163	A MISFORTUN OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
Line_164	IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
Line_165	IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTENBRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
Line_166	I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEAGE

Line_170	IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED FOOT IN OUR LAND
Line_171	AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES AND AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOUR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEAN THAT IS MY REWORD
Line_172	WHATT THAT LITTLE CABIN

Line_174	I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRSST
Line_175	YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
Line_176	IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
Line_177	ARE YOU A JINT
Line_178	HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALLIS OF TORMOLE WHO IS OUR QUEN
Line_179	WHAT IS IT CORILEY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
Line_180	SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
Line_181	HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROITSKIN
Line_182	DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALLICE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SUPRISED
Line_183	THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
Line_184	THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALLIS
Line_185	THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
Line_186	SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTENBRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAPTAIN BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
Line_187	NOW OUR WAY IS BLEST
Line_188	THEY SEEM VERY IGNEURENT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
Line_189	THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED THE MAN IN THE CROAUD
Line_190	THE QUEEN IS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMMPELL ORDER
Line_191	THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTREIST
Line_192	YES IT WAS WET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
Line_193	EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SEEN STILL MAINTAINED THE MANASTIC ELUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLY HAD CONKERED UP
Line_194	THE EAVL AND REMADY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESEANT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENCE DOGBILL
Line_195	THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NERROW AND STEEP ROUFT BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE
Line_196	YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES IN FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MNANERVA
Line_197	IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASSILS WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTISH ARCATECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESINING A DOMESTIC RESIDENTS
Line_198	IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOWS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VIULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
Line_199	IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR BRATHER HAMLET OF TOULEY VALE ON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETER
Line_200	NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
Line_201	THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
Line_202	THIS AVINEW WAS STRAT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROBE OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SICOMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NURRISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOWS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENIETH
Line_203	THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE TABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
Line_204	TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVNEW AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE
Line_205	OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSIMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A CIBLE IN FRIENSY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE SELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNTBURNT LOITERERS SULUTED HIM WITH THE SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGIEAN THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TALK OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRAN
Line_206	THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN ACCOUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
Line_207	STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUAR
Line_208	AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAGUESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVER
Line_209	MISSUS BOSELE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST OAT
Line_210	DOES ONE MISTER SAMIOUAL BOOSEL LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELLIAN
Line_211	BUT TRIVALLIAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISCUSTED AND REVULTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
Line_212	THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFENTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOSOL'S LAW
Line_213	IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBERA SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SVEAR BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
Line_214	OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOASEL
Line_215	IT'S THAT IS MAKE SIME I WON'T SAY WOT
Line_216	HE IS UP IN OWNSEER A MINDING OF HIS PARLAMENTORY DUTIES
Line_217	A DISTINCT PROMISES OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRIVELLIAN ON TRIVELLIAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
Line_218	THEN BASELE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
Line_219	AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GATE AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSSPECTED
Line_220	I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BE EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOSEL IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOSEL TUTCHED HER FOREHEAD
Line_221	PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TERIVILLIAN
Line_222	BASLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
Line_223	AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LOIERS
Line_224	AND ALL WORK HAD SEEACSED WITH HIM
Line_225	WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE RONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED TO GET HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
Line_226	IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME SIEAL
Line_227	AND BAUSEL AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
Line_228	DRAY THEM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
Line_229	BUT AS FOR THIS ERE CHILD BE
Line_230	TRIVELLIAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS RITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
Line_231	I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEARS
Line_232	IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGJESTED BOASEL
Line_233	MISSUS BOSELE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADYES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAM TE WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADYE'S LOVER
Line_234	HE CA'N'T SUCKLE HIM KANNY
Line_235	I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRIGVILLIAN
Line_236	IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSIEL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
Line_237	AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BASLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONEY WALKS
Line_238	AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMIOUL BOSEL THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVAICE
Line_239	BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'D BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHEIRE
Line_240	BOSLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTED OVER HIS BREST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
Line_241	ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OOBAYING ME A SECOND TIME TODAY
Line_242	I HOPE MISS MILLNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME

Line_474	WHAT WAS THIS NOETHING
Line_475	UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT

Line_660	BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GASH FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARME ONLY
Line_661	THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COLDBED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
Line_662	IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THROUGH IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT LARDER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT

Line_673	SEE BENIEETH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKIN OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYIN A SLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF JIGANTIC PALME LEAVES STROED AMONG THEM
Line_674	WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO AUD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
Line_675	WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD CEAPT ON BURNIN WOOD TO THIS DAY
Line_676	WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROU'F FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLISSTERING TO HEAL THEM
Line_677	THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS AGUARDED

Line_698	ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
Line_699	I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FOALFILL THAT PROMISS
Line_700	THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHETE RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAYE
Line_701	ECCOWED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
Line_702	BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
Line_703	WEADS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION RAINED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLINENT LITTLE GARDEN
Line_704	YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FOUORSED TO CLIME REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BEAR STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
Line_705	WHAT A FUSS WAS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
Line_706	OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMING UP THE FRIENDLY FUIRPOAL
Line_707	INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
Line_708	THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVEROET GARDEN
Line_709	I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIT UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
Line_710	MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FOLOWERS
Line_711	WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXORIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
Line_712	DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGH OUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
Line_713	THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLLECK ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILLY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEMB BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
Line_714	THE HUNNYSUCLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELED HER TO THE DIRT
Line_715	YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVIELIST WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU

Line_719	HE REALLY GREEEVED TO SEE IT
Line_720	STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNOREANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
Line_721	IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
Line_722	HE ENTERED A LARGE FOIRCOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND ALL
Line_723	HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
Line_724	HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEAR'S
Line_725	THE VIELINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXOLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMENER MARRIED THE ROIAL LOVERS AND THE CHAPPLE OF THE CASTLE
Line_726	THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDER BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRAND MOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
Line_727	THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SLAY
Line_728	HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADYES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
Line_729	SCAIRSELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
Line_730	THE LADY AND WAITING BECAME VERY IMPACIANT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
Line_731	ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGER WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND EAT THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_732	I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
Line_733	NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTELS AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN ONNEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EADICT
Line_734	WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CRISTENING TPHEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
Line_735	THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
Line_736	ONE OF THE YOUNG FARIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARME THE OLD FARIY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
Line_737	IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONER
Line_738	THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALLIS THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PEARSE HER HAND WITH A SPINDEL AND DY OF THE WOUND
Line_739	SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDEL THEN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PEARSED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED ALWAY
Line_740	BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
Line_741	HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CAASTAL BUT BEHOLD
Line_742	MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
Line_743	THE DAY IS COMING SAID POMITHIUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MAN KIND FROM THE EARTH
Line_744	AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMIETHIOUS ON MOUNT COCOUSIS AND HAD SENT DESEESES AND CARS INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
Line_745	BUT MEN CEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS CPOARING DOWN AND THE SEE WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
Line_746	SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALIAN
Line_747	WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DURALIAN TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
Line_748	WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PIETRA
Line_749	IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DUCALIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF PORMETHIOUS
Line_750	THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOIRSE OF TROUBLE
Line_751	NO ONE BUT DUCALIAN THE SON OF PROMYTHIOUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
Line_752	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
Line_753	GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPT INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
Line_754	BUT DUKCALIAN AND PIRRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
Line_755	WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
Line_756	THEY PERSWADED ELIQUENTLY
Line_757	I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISSILE
Line_758	BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOALLED PROBLIM
Line_759	HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOVES IT WAS NO GO
Line_760	RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRAD HAD FALLEN IN ITS
Line_761	HE WALKED UP AND SAIS HELOW BOYS WHAT IS IT BAHSS
Line_762	THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON MERFRIES BURROAW PIKE
Line_763	THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
Line_764	THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN HAUT WELL ALL NIGHT
Line_765	WE WERE ENNURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SCURMISH AND EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREET IN EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEET
Line_766	YANK SAIS WHAT BE YOU DOIN JOHNEY
Line_767	BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAIS GENTLEMAN I GANNE THE LAWN
Line_768	OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
Line_769	ADVANCE INTO TENNASEEY
Line_770	WE HAD BEAFS FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
Line_771	A YIANKE ALWAYS SAIS NAGER
Line_772	WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
Line_773	THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LOW THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
Line_774	A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS HIM'S REGIMENT
Line_775	A MAN AT THE WELL
Line_776	WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
Line_777	HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETRET
Line_778	YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE SLAW
Line_779	WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATEHOUCHIE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME RUT ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JO JOHNSON
Line_780	WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNASYY SIDE OF TENNASEY RIVER
Line_781	HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMMISS AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
Line_782	WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEETIM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
Line_783	I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOLDERE
Line_784	AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
Line_785	THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
Line_786	BUT IT COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WARING DEAD MAN'S SHOES
Line_787	BAD GENERAL SHIP I FOUGHT IT WAS CRISMOUSS
Line_788	I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
Line_789	BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
Line_790	HE DEVINE MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISST ITS AIME
Line_791	WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKIES AND TEY WERE PARING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
Line_792	SAIS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SUCESSH ON HIS WORD OTH OR BOAOND MARCH I SAY
Line_793	THE FETTERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHFILL THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
Line_794	HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROGN
Line_795	THE LEADEN HAIL STORMS SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFOARMED
Line_796	I CALL LEUTENANT CURNAL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKIES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKIES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME IN OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
Line_797	I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRATED AT MY GUN
Line_798	OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED THE KNIGHE ATTACK
Line_799	I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINES AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
Line_800	I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON MEE
Line_801	MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
Line_802	HE WAS STONED DEAD BUT I DROPPED AT FOOT QUINCK
Line_803	OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MERFHERE'S BURROW
Line_804	THE PRIVAT GOOD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
Line_805	OAKLY COLLAR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENESY REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEY LINE WITH HIS COLLARS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
Line_806	WE CEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
Line_807	WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKY LINE ON THE WILCRASON TURN PIKE
Line_808	WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTNACK
Line_809	WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAINS
Line_810	I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
Line_811	I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GORD
Line_812	FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY Y
Line_813	THE LANKY PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
Line_814	LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
Line_815	SHILOLW
Line_816	ON MUNDAY MORNING I TOO HAVE CAPTURED ME A MEAUL
Line_817	IT WAS WISER IN HIS OWN CONSET
Line_818	I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MEAL AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS KNOWE
Line_819	THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGNED
Line_820	THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROUPS
Line_821	ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMAR'S BREGADE RELIEIVED GLADDENS
Line_822	ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOAKES BUT YOU ARE A LEADL TOO SMART
Line_823	THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESY GIVE EM A HEAL COLUMBIA
Line_824	ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
Line_825	OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MAN TO KEEP IN CLINE
Line_826	THE ROAP HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S KNOW AND HE WAS FINLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROAP TO CROSS THE CREAK
Line_827	WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
Line_828	ON MUNDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSE
Line_829	I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANN AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STRUIN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
Line_830	SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROAP TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CASE ON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHISP UP
Line_831	SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HILSTORY
Line_832	I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL AT WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEEROWS OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHREKS AND GRONS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANEN CAPTURED AT CETTERA
Line_833	WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALBAMAR BREGAIDE
Line_834	MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS KNOS
Line_835	ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFETORATE LINES
Line_836	BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTAMETON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
Line_837	AS GLADDEN ROAD BY US A CURIER ROAT UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
Line_838	I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ARDER DE CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
Line_839	A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
Line_840	BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MNETALKEY AND HIS FORISTS
Line_841	SPRING CAME IN PARAS AND THEN SUMER
Line_842	THREE DAYS LATER MINNITALKE BECAME NEUSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
Line_843	ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPROISEWOOD ON THE BLACK STERGIAN RIVER
Line_844	NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
Line_845	ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WELBIGAOINE'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE OBDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
Line_846	CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOUR FATHERS WHILE MINNATALKEY AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELYNESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
Line_847	WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILLED
Line_848	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NUSM INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINATALKE
Line_849	THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
Line_850	WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCOUPE TAKEN
Line_851	ONE OF NEWSOM'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINTALKE AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
Line_852	A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WHOUNGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
Line_853	BUT THIS POWER OF DESCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
Line_854	WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEAR'S
Line_855	CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTORY SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPED SCOOLS
Line_856	BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WAY WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETALKE AND TO HIS FORISTS
Line_857	FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
Line_858	WABY ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCKSSENS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINUY AND AGILE AS A LINK AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
Line_859	THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEET OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROAD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WORRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
Line_860	MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNIAN OF NOUSOM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
Line_861	THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPLES AND BY THE TIME WABY WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNITALKEY TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANOR OF SPEACH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VAINS
Line_862	IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOUNGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
Line_863	THREE WEEKS LATER CAME A BIGAUN'S REPLY
Line_864	AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINTIAL GOVERMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOW ERS
Line_865	MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
Line_866	HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGERS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
Line_867	I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TUTCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED SENTARS
Line_868	A FEW STRAKE HOS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
Line_869	SNOW TEMPESTS IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
Line_870	I SHOULD HAVE A VILENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERSIZE
Line_871	HAUNS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVEARRYING STEP
Line_872	HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANZSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
Line_873	I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDER WAS TO BE FOUNDS
Line_874	BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO WASTE
Line_875	I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRICIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FIORDFORE THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEE AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
Line_876	THESE SACRED ETIFISES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISSTHEM
Line_877	LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTICALE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNIFFELS WHERE AGLAMORATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CAYOS
Line_878	TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME OBSUERD
Line_879	WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPRAT EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEEN
Line_880	IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELIGENCE THAN THEIR'S
Line_881	WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
Line_882	I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXILNERATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
Line_883	THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
Line_884	OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WISP OR SPEIR
Line_885	GIEOGRFERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST CQORTER WHICH IN THE VENACULAR IS CALLED SUDVEST FEORTENGER
Line_886	IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
Line_887	AT LENGTH THE STIRTY LITTLE PONEY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF ROADS
Line_888	ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMAN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
Line_889	THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHO HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
Line_890	THEN WITHOUT FIRTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
Line_891	ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VULCARY
Line_892	THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROWIC PRINCE OF DENDMARKE
Line_893	ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SITED KAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MIDRIALS YOKEL WHICH THE WETHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
Line_894	WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORRIS WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
Line_895	NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAUND
Line_896	HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A SIVLE SERVANT A MAGISTRAT THE GOVERNER OF THE ILAND BARROAN TRAMP
Line_897	MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOUTY AND DISATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GOST OF HAMLET
Line_898	THE VULCAR CEPT OFF THE COST STEARING TO THE WESTWARD
Line_899	I HAVE NOT THE SLIGTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYENCE OF THE PASTER AND CONGREGATION
Line_900	THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
Line_901	NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AUN GOS WELL THE WORST DIFFICOLTY IS NOW OVER
Line_902	BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
Line_903	THE FACT WAS THAT SCARSELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIOTICAL VESSILE
Line_904	WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIN
Line_905	ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WAILS AND SHARKS
Line_906	NO MISTER HARDEWEIG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
Line_907	VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SUCNEUSM
Line_908	THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIRE SCAL IN THE LATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESCOMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PROCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
Line_909	THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR SENSTURIES
Line_910	IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
Line_911	I SAW BUT FEW INHABITENTS DURING MY EXCERSION BUT I MET A CROUD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
Line_912	I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT TEM
Line_913	THIS MODEST SCOLLER SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATENT
Line_914	THANKS TO THE HEET OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR CHAY
Line_915	BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SIIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
Line_916	AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
Line_917	TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFY AND THAN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JAB
Line_918	RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAIS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
Line_919	AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY AIT
Line_920	I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH
Line_921	SOME HOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE IS IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHACES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE IS NOT BIAZY SLEEPING
Line_922	YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANY WAY
Line_923	I TOLD TOM WE SHOU'DN'T COME SO LATE SAIS HILDA
Line_924	I TURN OFF THE TELIVISIAN SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRAND FATHER WHO IS A SPOOK AFTER ALL
Line_925	I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
Line_926	PAH IT'S A COURSE
Line_927	SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM HERE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASMA
Line_928	I EXPLAINED THAT I'M TAKING MUSICK AND ALSO BYOLOGY ALBAR ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSICK HE SNORTS
Line_929	SO SHE CARES HEA
Line_930	YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSSELF
Line_931	WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATES CAT HOMES
Line_932	HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN ARROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
Line_933	IT'S YOUR FOALT MOP IT UP YOUR SELF
Line_934	THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
Line_935	I HEAR THE TEVY GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POPP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE CITCHION TO TALK TO MAMB
Line_936	TOMSONS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
Line_937	BESIDES SAIS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOURE SO MUCH ALIKE MEN LIKE HIM SURER
Line_938	SOMETIMES ROLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THE'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HEAH
Line_939	I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREETVE
Line_940	HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
Line_941	IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROOUND
Line_942	WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN AGUIZSED TEY PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
Line_943	I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAIS TAWM
Line_944	PUMP GOES RIGHT ON TONING HIS CHANNELS
Line_945	I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
Line_946	THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPACIANT OF THE SMALLEST SENURE AND INSACIABLE OF PRAIZE
Line_947	IF I APPLAWED THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITENTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
Line_948	CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
Line_949	THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONXT THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
Line_950	I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OVE REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DIMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
Line_951	I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
Line_952	IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOL OBJECT WHICH HE UNSEASINGLY PERSEUS BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTANCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THIS SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY HOLY FORRON TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
Line_953	THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON WEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSED BY THE ACQUASITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUON
Line_954	THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURIL GELOISSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MAN OF DIMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSESION
Line_955	AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEASURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS COWLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF YUROUP SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
Line_956	THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
Line_957	THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILAGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
Line_958	IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSESS EMMENSE PRIVILAGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH CRUHERDEM

Line_1186	BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
Line_1187	BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR HILDREN
Line_1188	HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVESS
Line_1189	THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAYED CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND AIT THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
Line_1190	GRETTEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
Line_1191	AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
Line_1192	COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM IN TO HER COTTEGE
Line_1193	HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETTEL BROKE A LARGE ROWND PAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
Line_1194	AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARINKED THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
Line_1195	THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATEAS DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO YOUSE
Line_1196	OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALLFORE DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US
Line_1197	HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BRAKE OR BIGHT AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
Line_1198	EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEP MOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMAREPIECE
Line_1199	THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
Line_1200	CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETTEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANDSOLE
Line_1201	BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
Line_1202	AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WHITCHE'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PERILS AND PRECIOUS STONES

Line_1207	BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
Line_1208	IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HELTH AND CALFED VILENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPIGHT OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
Line_1209	IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
Line_1210	I HAVE ALWAYS DELITED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDED TIPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGIPTIAN GREEK AND ETALLIAN
Line_1211	EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROUT AND VEGITATED SOME HOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIRA MERCANTILE OF THE BLEEKEST
Line_1212	HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RESENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
Line_1213	EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREAT HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAGIESTY OF THEIR OWN
Line_1214	THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELEASSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
Line_1215	THE VINE GRUB OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SINEBORDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
Line_1216	THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMAN BEAUTIFUL
Line_1217	THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY COULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESNOUTS WALLNOUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
Line_1218	WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD HATCHES
Line_1219	THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONG THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
Line_1220	AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WEALS IN SPIGHT OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IORN RAILS
Line_1221	THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HILM
Line_1222	THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAGN
Line_1223	THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
Line_1224	THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
Line_1225	EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EILIDS EILASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVERIABLLY PERFECT
Line_1226	MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLIGHTNESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYING ME NOR I THEM
Line_1227	SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPPLES WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
Line_1228	I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
Line_1229	I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAIL'S
Line_1230	THE DESIRE WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
Line_1231	SUFFICED THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APPARTEMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
Line_1232	ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVIZJES TO THE PRINTER
Line_1233	THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
Line_1234	I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVERABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PAMALGASETT OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATER OF APRIL TWENTYIETH
Line_1235	THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE CHOPPY RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
Line_1236	I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISS USE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELED SHOLD HAVE ACCERED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HEERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
Line_1237	I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EROWIE THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE RITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COOD
Line_1238	THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPIGHT OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDANCE TO ONE ANOTHER
Line_1239	I ALSO ROAT ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ALTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRILE OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMTION
Line_1240	PREFS TO THE SECOND ADDITTION
Line_1241	I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW ADDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STUORIOS THEN MADE
Line_1242	I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINSEERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREETED MY ADVENTURES
Line_1243	THE FIRST ADDITION OF IRONE SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOLDS AND AS THE DIEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
Line_1244	IT WAS RITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGATADA DISTRICT OF THE CANABORY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW SEELAND AND APPEARED AT CRIST CHERCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JOON THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
Line_1245	THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAIUS
Line_1246	BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
Line_1247	I SEE FOR MY SECOND PREFASS THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MISSURS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS OBTAINED THE HIEST RANK AMONG LIVING RIGHTERS I LEAD IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
Line_1248	I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MASHEENS AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN OBSERDITY
Line_1249	THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS AIT
Line_1250	NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF ONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SUO
Line_1251	I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
Line_1252	IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE IYH BECOMES ACCOUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDREAD
Line_1253	I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEAMASFIIR I WAS
Line_1254	SO LONELY AND SO SOLLEAM WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMP BLEEDING UPON THE MOUNTAINSIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BRAKING
Line_1255	SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BREAD WITH EXTREME REPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AKERS OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN AKER BETWEEN THE SEE AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY

Line_1257	IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTCEEDANTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LEAD ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NEARATIVE WOULD BE TEEDIOUS TO HIM AM PAINFUL TO MYSELF
Line_1258	I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND OR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICALT MATTER FOR THEY WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING YUSE THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
Line_1259	I WAS DELIPTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
Line_1260	THEY WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK US AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
Line_1261	EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
Line_1262	IT WAS A MANOTENOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
Line_1263	IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGNE AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAAGE

Line_1590	THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
Line_1591	THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOYLAN BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
Line_1592	THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMIDATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NO THING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS CEPT
Line_1593	ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
Line_1594	FESTIVE YEWS
Line_1595	WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CARET
Line_1596	WE'VE LOST THE KE OF THE SELLER AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
Line_1597	HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
Line_1598	A VOICE INQUIRED WHO IS THERE
Line_1599	THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREETPING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
Line_1600	I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MAGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARDS I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
Line_1601	IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
Line_1602	THE REPLY WAS RITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMINEAN HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAG
Line_1603	IT WAS A HORRIBLE GERXNEY
Line_1604	I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CRISMESS CROUD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
Line_1605	PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND AS A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
Line_1606	NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVEAL
Line_1607	I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CRISMESS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXPTINCED BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
Line_1608	NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
Line_1609	I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CRISMESSES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A SHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB WHERE MY COUSIN LUSCE'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLES THE FESTIVE SEESON
Line_1610	IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
Line_1611	NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A HALF A MILE AND HANGARDEAN THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOWED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
Line_1612	BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARRD
Line_1613	I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND NIT
Line_1614	I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINHMENT
Line_1615	THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFL OD
Line_1616	THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CORASS OF LAFTER
Line_1617	THER BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
Line_1618	AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTONING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDELA IN HER HAND
Line_1619	I HAD NO ELUCSIONS
Line_1620	MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
Line_1621	I MISTER CRISTOFHER FROM LUENDON
Line_1622	IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE HIS WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SAID TO PLAY IN IT
Line_1623	IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
Line_1624	FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE MATTER OF THE RISING
Line_1625	SOME ONE SNIGGERED
Line_1626	WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARRY AN SHE ROAT AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HUNNEYMOONE IN HER COTTEGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
Line_1627	HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
Line_1628	AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
Line_1629	HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR GERNY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COOPONS FOR FREE BORD AND LODGING AT THE HOTELL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
Line_1630	SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATUREL
Line_1631	IT IS A MOST DELIGHTFUL
Line_1632	I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO AUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY AUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
Line_1633	A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BOOSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
Line_1634	HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
Line_1635	WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HUNEHYMON TO ITTILY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
Line_1636	THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
Line_1637	SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULIUS
Line_1638	OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
Line_1639	A SECOND COUSEN OF MARRENS IS IN THE COOK'S TOORS LINE
Line_1640	I KNOW WHAT MAMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES AIT
Line_1641	BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE OOPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T YOUSE
Line_1642	THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIAN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RENCOROUS ASCIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
Line_1643	WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARRY AN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WIRDING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
Line_1644	BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNEWBLINGS
Line_1645	I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLYEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARRY ANS THINGS HAVE BEEN ALLREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
Line_1646	THE GIRL IS FREADDING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE AIT
Line_1647	I SHALL MAKE POPPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
Line_1648	I GASPED POSITIVELY GHASPED
Line_1649	AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHERKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS AITHER
Line_1650	FROM A COUSEN OF OURS WHO IS IN THAT LIGNE
Line_1651	I CAN NOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNEWLINGS MOVE
Line_1652	IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPITION SPROINGS
Line_1653	I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSEN GOT A PROPHET OUT OF MARIAN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HAND IT OVER THE AMOUNT
Line_1654	AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MICK FERSON HAS MARRIAN GIVEN YOU HER CLOVE
Line_1655	IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFTERBALLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
Line_1656	THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION ACCURED UPON THE SUNDAY EVE NING
Line_1657	THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MICK FERSHON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
Line_1658	I NEVER SAW A PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINDS
Line_1659	THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTIE FOR ALL I NOW
Line_1660	THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
Line_1661	AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HER'S
Line_1662	BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
Line_1663	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
Line_1664	PEES THE CARS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
Line_1665	I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
Line_1666	I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
Line_1667	HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISIEN HIM
Line_1668	NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
Line_1669	TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OE
Line_1670	AS FOR THE UCARIST TRANDSUBSTANCHIATION THE REAL PRESENTS IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENTS AND YET THEY WERE NOT GESUITS
Line_1671	WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
Line_1672	BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARO INTELECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
Line_1673	THERE WAS NO COWERDLY TRAITER AMONXST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWEDE
Line_1674	I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GAUNDOLLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
Line_1675	THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODUSTO SILENCE
Line_1676	YOUR PART MENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOSE YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GANDOLLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEEQUINS A MONTH
Line_1677	IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
Line_1678	WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
Line_1679	UNWILLING TO HERT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSESSED A CERTAIN NUMOURAL CALCULIS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKE TO PUT
Line_1680	I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEME NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUPING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIEST SOCIETY
Line_1681	THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CRISTIONS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHERCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTES AND FULL OF SCROAUPLES
Line_1682	BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORICLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DOVOLE AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
Line_1683	I OBAYED IMPLICIETELY AND MET YOUR EXCOLENY
Line_1684	YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
Line_1685	HE INTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
Line_1686	BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
Line_1687	HE ROAT THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
Line_1688	THE WAITER OF THE MAGASIENO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DO ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENEALTY OF DEATH
Line_1689	YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
Line_1690	I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HIPOCRESY AND I SHOULDHAVEBEEN DISPICCKABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIOUS
Line_1691	AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPARED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINLKING
Line_1692	MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
Line_1693	WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINABTE PRACTICAL JOKES
Line_1694	IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PERISHES OF THE CITY OF VENUS THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGASIENOE
Line_1695	THE FESITION WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MATURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
Line_1696	THEY ALL ASK ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULISE
Line_1697	WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOST
Line_1698	I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISH TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
Line_1699	WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME ENTELEGENCE WHICH GOOD LITERARY AND SIENTIFIC NOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEANE FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRETY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
Line_1700	I JUMPED OUT OF THE GANDOLLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFY HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
Line_1701	THEY BELIEVE THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSESSED THE PHILOSOFERSTONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELIMENTORY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANX TO MY SUBLIME SIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERMENT IN YUROUP
Line_1702	DELINTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
Line_1703	WE DID THE SAME WITH PFISITIONS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXOLENTHELTH
Line_1704	I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
Line_1705	OUR SCANDLISS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER

Line_1708	THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
Line_1709	NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HURMET ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DYE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SIENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PRODICTION
Line_1710	TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A FESITION WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLOND AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
Line_1711	I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM'
Line_1712	I THROW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
Line_1713	THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BEAD TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
Line_1714	WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHERCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHERCHWORDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS

Line_1807	OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BREGOINS HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
Line_1808	ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MIL'DLY
Line_1809	HE HAS RITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPNRESSABLE
Line_1810	THE PLAY WRIGHT GAVE MAIN HALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FATED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
Line_1811	AS THEY SAT DOWN A BIRST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
Line_1812	I HAPPEN TO HAVE MACKANL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
Line_1813	HE IS ANOTHER WHO IS AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
Line_1814	I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
Line_1815	I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
Line_1816	HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
Line_1817	I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
Line_1818	THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHIN G
Line_1819	OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
Line_1820	YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLOY
Line_1821	THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE PARTLY FOUND ALMOST INTORLORABLE
Line_1822	BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
Line_1823	PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEAEVE
Line_1824	DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
Line_1825	I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS GRONG
Line_1826	SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID AIT
Line_1827	HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
Line_1828	AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_1829	IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
Line_1830	ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE ENOW
Line_1831	YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFERENT
Line_1832	YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WISPMERED
Line_1833	YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT OME
Line_1834	I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE ESPOILES THE OTHER
Line_1835	AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLLER FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPPLASH
Line_1836	HELDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
Line_1837	SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRSS
Line_1838	SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WORENHT YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
Line_1839	SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUSSHED FORWARD LIKE A CATAPOLE IN LEACH
Line_1840	SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
Line_1841	COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY TARTLY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
Line_1842	SOMETHING OF THEIR CHUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOTO
Line_1843	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_1844	IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
Line_1845	AFTER THE VERY FIRST
Line_1846	IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BRAKE HILDYA
Line_1847	I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
Line_1848	HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS S
Line_1849	WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEBY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
Line_1850	SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER'S SHOULDER
Line_1851	HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER CHEMBELING AND SCARSELY BREETING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
Line_1852	IMMERGING AT EUSTERN AT HALF PAST THREE OCCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SEVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORDS SQUAR
Line_1853	SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
Line_1854	A COLD FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
Line_1855	SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
Line_1856	I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEYL
Line_1857	AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT T
Line_1858	I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LANDON
Line_1859	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T ARN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
Line_1860	IF YOU'D SENT ME A KNOT OR TELIFONE TO ME OR ANYTHIN G
Line_1861	THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY CHOMMITTED
Line_1862	ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT THER
Line_1863	YES I KNOW VERY WELL
Line_1864	HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HA'R
Line_1865	ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETLY
Line_1866	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUTS
Line_1867	HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO IME
Line_1868	OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
Line_1869	BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
Line_1870	ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
Line_1871	I'VE BEEN UP IN CANIDA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
Line_1872	OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OW ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SALE ON TOOSDAY
Line_1873	OH BARTLEY DID YOU RIGHT TO ME
Line_1874	I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
Line_1875	ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILEY
Line_1876	HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM SQUICKLY
Line_1877	LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEIRE OASING WATER
Line_1878	I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
Line_1879	I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COOMING
Line_1880	IN THEIR EYES GESAS OF NASERATH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LAGITIMATE SON OF JOSIF AND MARRY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEETY
Line_1881	YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS A POLINARIAS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLINATION
Line_1882	NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE EONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
Line_1883	THE SON OF A VERGIAN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLENCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
Line_1884	THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTORIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SISTOM OF CARENTHOUS
Line_1885	HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN KIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRETIES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTIS AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAINE THE HUMBLE VIRTUS OF JESIS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
Line_1886	HE ACQUIESSED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOFERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENCATIVE SOLL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOW GOS FOR INTILECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPAL IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
Line_1887	A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELIGHTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIANIGHTS OR AT LEAST THE NASORINS WERE DESTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIYIC RIGHTS
Line_1888	WHEN THE MESSIA WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JES THE CRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLARMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY GESS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
Line_1889	UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABET SERAPIAN HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATICABLE ARTER THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPLES THE CATHOLIC APPISSALS AND THEAPPISSAL TO THE ROMANS
Line_1890	THE WORTHY FRIEND OF APHENASIS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY RESCTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGUR OF GEAMETRICAL DEMINSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
Line_1891	THEIR CHERCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VERIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE SEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
Line_1892	BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIENCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WEASILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANCIAL INDESOLLIABLE AND EVERLASTING UNIAN OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOL AND HUMAN FLESH
Line_1893	MANY AMONG THE GENTIL PROSLEIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A SELESTIAL SPIRIT AND UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR SEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY OBDURED THE HUMANITY OF CRIST
Line_1894	YET THE MOST CHARITIBLE CRITISISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTORIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CRIST
Line_1895	HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREESCE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
Line_1896	BUT THE JUSTNESS AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTER AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFAINE
Line_1897	A FEIS THAT COULD INCRECE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SORSES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPARING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
Line_1898	BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ATTURNITY AND INHEARENT PRAVETY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMETIVE CHERCHES OF THE EAST
Line_1899	HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JEORDEN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPETENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ELUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
Line_1900	BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CRISTE WAS A FANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSABLE AND INCORUPTABLE BODY
Line_1901	RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPARE THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING
Line_1902	WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARK AT THE DAWN OF THE DAY LEAD A SEDITIOUS MOULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE CINNEGOGS
Line_1903	BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MASSINGERS OF EGIPT
Line_1904	A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEAMIES OR NUBIANS INVATED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREET THEY DISMISSED A CROUD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD MISTRIOUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NIL THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AN ORTHEDOCX'S CITY TO THE MILD OR SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
Line_1905	THE VANITY OF KELLISTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSIAN OF A MUNK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATTIN CLERGY WAS IGNORENT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
Line_1906	EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HYERITICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
Line_1907	AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENEW OF THE THRON WAS ASSALTED WITH GOLD
Line_1908	SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METRAPOLITIAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHEREN
Line_1909	THIS DEAL OF CARL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAIZE
Line_1910	THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS OWN POPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECRECED THE NUMBER OF THE SCISMATICS WHO REVEARED MISTORIOUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FATH
Line_1911	AT THESE BLASTFROMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
Line_1912	BY THE VIGULENCE OF MEMBNONE THE CHERCHES WERE SHOT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL
Line_1913	ARDENT IN THE PREORSECUTION OF HERISY KERIL OUSPITIOUSLY OPENED HIS RAIN BY OPPRESSING THE NVATIONS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF SECTORIES
Line_1914	ARESTIAS COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THE ADOSIOUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PREFECT OF EJIPT
Line_1915	THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIOUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAIED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE UNICS AND WOMEN OF THE PALLIS SUPERSTITION AND AVERS WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHEDOQXS CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEVERS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
Line_1916	BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHERCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERCEEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DEUTY
Line_1917	WHICH OPPRESSED THE METRAPOLITANS OF YUROUP AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOKAN ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DISIS BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
Line_1918	NISTORIOUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDOCESSER CRISESTOM TO DISCLAIME THE JERISTICTION AND TO DISOBAY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEET OF JUDGMENT
Line_1919	SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMAE VERSIAN OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PERMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLINY
Line_1920	DURING A BIZSZY PERIAD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPORER TRIED EVERY METHOD ACCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONSIL THIS THIOLOGICAL QUARREL
Line_1921	A RUMER WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CRISTIONS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTICLE TO THE RECONSILIATION OF THE PREFECT AND THE ARCH BISHOP AND THAT OBSTICLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED
Line_1922	HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUISSID
Line_1923	ONNUST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEAR'S
Line_1924	HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFTOARBLE CHAT
Line_1925	WHEN WE TOOK OUR SKEETS AT THE BRECKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
Line_1926	AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEET WATER STOLL A GLANCE AT MISTER GRICE
Line_1927	THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM NIN
Line_1928	WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LABE BELLOW
Line_1929	AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPFON
Line_1930	I AM LOOKING AT HIM NDOW
Line_1931	SWEET WATER SOME ONE DROUW THAT WEAPON OUT
Line_1932	AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMIDTION
Line_1933	JUST AN EVERY DAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THUROW
Line_1934	I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
Line_1935	A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
Line_1936	IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THER'E
Line_1937	GEORGE NOBDDED
Line_1938	WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SEEN SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LARBY
Line_1939	THE TIME IS NERROWED DOWN TO RUN AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKS WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TUTCH HER
Line_1940	NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIR'ST
Line_1941	HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREEDING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPER'S
Line_1942	NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
Line_1943	YES MANY TIME'S
Line_1944	IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRICE
Line_1945	A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORDER BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
Line_1946	NO DOUQT
Line_1947	WHERE EVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAIR
Line_1948	THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVES BUNDLED UP FLAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
Line_1949	INSTANTLY THEY OBSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
Line_1950	THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDDOER
Line_1951	I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
Line_1952	WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
Line_1953	YES MISTER SLATER AT THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LUBY AT THE TIME SAIS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
Line_1954	SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PERPOSE WHICH LEAD HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORSEE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
Line_1955	NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND A SUDDEN FALL
Line_1956	I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHIY
Line_1957	THERE WAS NO POIRARD IN THE WOUND
Line_1958	IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GHEORGE
Line_1959	YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MONE
Line_1960	SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR THER
Line_1961	WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRICE
Line_1962	DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHELLENER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
Line_1963	YES HE'S MORE CURIOARL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
Line_1964	WELL WELL THAT'S ONNUST AT ALL EGVENTS
Line_1965	THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGEMENT SO MUCH RELIENCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
Line_1966	I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OV AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
Line_1967	HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALUERNMENT FOR HIM
Line_1968	THE BOYS LOOK QUITE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOTS
Line_1969	YES MISS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE SPERRISHES
Line_1970	I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND ROUMATIC INVILID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
Line_1971	BENT OVER THE GROUND STUDDYED THE AFFAIR CAREFOULLY
Line_1972	IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLAICE
Line_1973	VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU TWILL
Line_1974	NOT A VERY NATURAL ONE I WAS SHOULD SAY
Line_1975	THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
Line_1976	THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
Line_1977	WHAT DOES HE WANT
Line_1978	HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GHEORGE
Line_1979	THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
Line_1980	BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELIVATER
Line_1981	THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARM'S
Line_1982	ING KNOW WHA IT SOUNDS FULISH BUT THE ALTURNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
Line_1983	AYES
Line_1984	BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
Line_1985	BUT NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
Line_1986	THIS SWEET WATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTAGIAS AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVERET
Line_1987	J'HEORGE
Line_1988	IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOOBY AND THERE IT ITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
Line_1989	I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
Line_1990	SWEET WATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
Line_1991	ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME INE
Line_1992	THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
Line_1993	THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FULLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER ITT
Line_1994	I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOWS
Line_1995	I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FRIRTIVE WATCHER
Line_1996	VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIRINEARE ME
Line_1997	HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBAY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND OME
Line_1998	ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSITINANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
Line_1999	OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
Line_2000	I EMPHASIZED COMPLACENTLY
Line_2001	THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCEE
Line_2002	AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
Line_2003	BUT I AM IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
Line_2004	BUT CLOUTS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
Line_2005	I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
Line_2006	FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSITIOAN'S GALLORY
Line_2007	HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRICE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD AND SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
Line_2008	MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUARRIED MUSINGLY
Line_2009	IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOULT FROM HEAVEN
Line_2010	MARK SOWERBY AND CLOE HENTERBERG
Line_2011	NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MESNIN WHAT FOLLOWS
Line_2012	THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHERRIET TRIUMFPFAL ON TWO WEALS WHICH BY A GRIFFON'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
Line_2013	BY HIS DEFALT SHORT WHILE HE SURJUERNED HERE BY HIS DEFALT TO WEAPING AND TO TOILE HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAFTER AND SWEET PLAY
Line_2014	YOU KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NORE NIGHT NORE SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
Line_2015	TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIGIENCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
Line_2016	THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITSELF DELITING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDFUL OF ETERNAL PIECE
Line_2017	AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELITS ONWARD GOW LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNENS HAD THE SEMBLENCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DESTINCT WITH SEVEN FOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLLARS WHENCE THE SON'S BOW IS MADE AND DILLIA'S GIRDLE
Line_2018	AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PNEARSED ME THROUGH AIR FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
Line_2019	DOAUNTAY BECAUSE VEIRDILLIOUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEAP YET DO NOT WEAP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEADST MUST WEAP
Line_2020	SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLYENCES FOR HIS SELVBATION WERE ALL READY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PRODITION
Line_2021	BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHIMES
Line_2022	BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGIANS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
Line_2023	TO SAY UNTO VERGILLIOUS NOT A DRAHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
Line_2024	THIS EVERY OTHER SAVER DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOT WITH STANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
Line_2025	THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEASPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOL BE OF ONE MEASURE
Line_2026	THESE STANDERDS TO THE REAR WOARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTER MOST APPART
Line_2027	I DO NOT THINK THERE SHOWN SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANS FIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL COUSTOMN
Line_2028	LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOUTH IME BEATRISS
Line_2029	THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WEAL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY READ THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN GNOTED
Line_2030	NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HER SELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
Line_2031	THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSAPIENA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
Line_2032	IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABITS BUT LIKE IN GATE EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
Line_2033	AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHER'S
Line_2034	BUT BY THE LARSZESS OF SUELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LAOUGFTY VAPERS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOTT
Line_2035	I SAW THE LADY WHO AIRE WHILE APPEARED VALED UNDERNETH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
Line_2036	AND WHAT ALOARMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOT STEPS UNTO THEM
Line_2037	CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS
Line_2038	NOW HALECONE MUST NEEDS POORE FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER QUIERE YARANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICOLT TO THINK
Line_2039	AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERGUIED

Line_2341	BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTANDE
Line_2342	WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOM
Line_2343	AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOOMIS
Line_2344	SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO KNOW WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOL

Line_2346	BUT LIVING SOLI THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEAT
Line_2347	WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
Line_2348	SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHOIND
Line_2349	SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOUWILING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE

Line_2356	AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEE AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT EROR
Line_2357	NOW IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
Line_2358	SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM ALRICK IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOWS
Line_2359	YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRIST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDERD POETS AND OF THE CHEEPER WEAKLY ERNALS

Line_2605	THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENCE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
Line_2606	WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
Line_2607	IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDEL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERIN'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENEDICK TO RETURN TO LUNDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND

Line_2627	SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS A DEAD
Line_2628	MONESTLY
Line_2629	A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMAROKED
Line_2630	SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPITIOUSL'Y
Line_2631	THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
Line_2632	IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTICLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD

Line_2645	SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
Line_2646	THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TUNGA CAN UTTER

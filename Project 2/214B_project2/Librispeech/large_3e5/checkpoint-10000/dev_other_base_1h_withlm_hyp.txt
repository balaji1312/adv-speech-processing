Line_0	ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURT YARD WERE THE PALICE BUILDINS IN ONE KENIEADIS LIVED WITH ABSCIRDIS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALSIOPAY AND MEDIA LIVED WITH THEIR HAND MAGENS
Line_1	WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THERE AFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASIS
Line_2	AITAS HEART WAS FILLED WITH RATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHOWN AS A LEAPPARD'S EYES
Line_3	SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
Line_4	WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROWS OF GREECE
Line_5	AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASEN AND HIS COMRADS WITH THE SONS OF FRICTCIS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
Line_6	METIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
Line_7	JASEON TOOK PELLIOUS AND TELEMOWN WITH HIM
Line_8	THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
Line_9	THEN I SOED THE FUROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DAMEATOR GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGAN
Line_10	AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KEN IN A QUIET VOICE JASEON SAID
Line_11	SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
Line_12	AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDSLIECE TO BEAR WAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIL OF YOU
Line_13	IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THOSE MORTALS
Line_14	THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
Line_15	FOR JASEON WAS THE GRAND SON OF CRETHIOUS AND CRETHIOUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
Line_16	AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEEN CHACED BY A HOCK AND METIA SAW THE HOCK'S EYES AND BEAK
Line_17	THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEAROWS WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALICE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
Line_18	ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTERFOES THE SARAMATI
Line_19	HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRILE HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
Line_20	BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY SITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YELD T TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
Line_21	FRANTIS AND MELLSE WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
Line_22	HE WITH HIS COMRADS WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
Line_23	AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MITIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
Line_24	IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEIECE
Line_25	I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AT AS IT IS
Line_26	AND MANY OF THE MAGITIONS OF EAGIPT WHO HAD COME WITH KEAN SIOSTROUS STAYED IN THAT CITY AVAA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON AND HER GOING AND COMING IN HARISIN AND SETTING
Line_27	KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ERRIS YOUNDER I HAVE TWO FIBERIYIAN BOLLS WITH FEET ABRASS
Line_28	WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WEAL AND ANOTHER IN THE BUSOM OF HIS FAMILY
Line_29	FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDET FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DESTINGUISHED BY THE OBSERDITY OF THEIR MEANS
Line_30	SO DID SOCRETIES AND GERDAUNO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HEROW OF THE TROUOTHS SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
Line_31	WEAPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPTHTHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURSE
Line_32	THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEN OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
Line_33	IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPPASSITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO PON IMAGINATION
Line_34	EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOUGHT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUND ABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEAP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEAPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
Line_35	FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEAPS FOR THE FAIT OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEAPS WIN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
Line_36	WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVAY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITS SELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
Line_37	THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
Line_38	HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GOULTH ONLY BLONS TO A FLEEDING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON
Line_39	THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONSERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUT GOOD OR BAD FORTUON
Line_40	YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDGUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUT WAY THEREGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
Line_41	FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
Line_42	WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
Line_43	HE RECOGNIZES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEN AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERI
Line_44	BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INNEVITIBLE SYMPTM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
Line_45	FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CAN NOT CAUSE SUCH ANXZIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
Line_46	THEREFORE AL THOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MAN KIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ON YET THE PERMINENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND AVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
Line_47	THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIGUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND COUSTOM
Line_48	IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRIN OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
Line_49	THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPALS WHICH THEY GAVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CAN NOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO OUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETURNALLY FREE WILL
Line_50	THE OPPOSET OF THE STEME OF CONSCIONCE THE ORGIN AND SIGNIFICENCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIONCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DIS INTERESTED DEED
Line_51	AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACOLIS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UN DONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISSED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITH OUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
Line_52	THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLUEARED AND HER NEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURT YARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MADDED HAIR
Line_53	WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MIN NO APPOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NEADMEDDIS
Line_54	AND AS A MORTALE APPOLLOW SOPPED TO UARN HIS BRED AMONGXST MEN
Line_55	ADMEDDIS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KEEN'S PLACE AND GOETH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
Line_56	IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
Line_57	AND THEN HERACLIS FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM
Line_58	AND AS FOR ADMETTOS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCASTOS SAT LAINE AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
Line_59	IF ONE WILL GO WILLINLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMEDIS
Line_60	THAT WAS BEFORE HAD MEADOUS SAILED ON THE AREGO WITH JASEN AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
Line_61	AFTERWARDS PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETISES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEAN
Line_62	NOW THE FOOT STEPS SEEMED TO STOP
Line_63	BUT APPOLLO TURNED TO ADMETIS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_64	ADD MEDDS AT MEDS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
Line_65	HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KEAN AND GO WITH DEATH
Line_66	THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETIS I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
Line_67	DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
Line_68	THEN AT METTOUS RAISED THE VAILE OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
Line_69	IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO A MEADMADIS AND MEATS KNOW THAT EVEN KNOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDIN DEATH FOR YOU
Line_70	AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONCENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
Line_71	I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDER WORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GARDS LOSE WHOM DEATH BREENED SDOWN INTER THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD
Line_72	YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISS TO GO FORTH FROM THIS SAMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
Line_73	HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRENT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETTOS
Line_74	HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGNED BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WONE HER FROM AN ENEMY
Line_75	HE LIFTED ALCESTIS THROWN THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALLICE
Line_76	SHE WAS VAILED AND ADMENTIS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
Line_77	NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE POLISE
Line_78	WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
Line_79	HE LEFT THE PALLICS OF ADMETOUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
Line_80	ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEAN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
Line_81	BUT STILL APPOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_82	AND WHAT A NOBLE THEM IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
Line_83	NO MORE SPEACH CAME FROM HER
Line_84	THEN ADMETIS WENT INTO THE PALLICS AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE RECHED ONES ROUND THE PALICE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
Line_85	A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ATMETTIS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APPOLLOW COME TO HIM AGAIN
Line_86	AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONS IN THE COURT YARD GRIND IN CORN BETWEEN TWO STONS
Line_87	BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
Line_88	THERE AFTER AT MEDDOUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
Line_89	TO WHAT GOD DOES THAT SACREIFICE DO
Line_90	JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDGS
Line_91	IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POKA PRANTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
Line_92	AFTER HEAD EATEN A FAIR MAL HE FELL ASLEEP
Line_93	I RAN OUP PULL HIM A GUN
Line_94	IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND IT DOESN'T LIKE US AND HE CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
Line_95	THEIR COFFIN WEARS THEIR SHIP AND THE GRAVE IT WAS THE SEE BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEE DONE ON THE COST OF THE HIGH BARBARIE
Line_96	A THIRD OF THE TREASUR WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MAN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SKEAM DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
Line_97	THEN AGAIN I'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG UNTILL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWN BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DID ANT GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE JUST TALK
Line_98	WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
Line_99	THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
Line_100	THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEIN ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREETHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
Line_101	WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFHENOHN AND AS I WAS LOOK OUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
Line_102	YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I'E PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
Line_103	HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HERS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
Line_104	HE LOOKED AT ME MATTY SUSPITIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
Line_105	WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
Line_106	ONE LITTLE SQUEASE TALK A BATCH OF DEADLY WEAPONS
Line_107	THE EX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
Line_108	WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
Line_109	THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
Line_110	THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU'D BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
Line_111	HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS POLSIN FOR REPLYES
Line_112	DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING AD JOBS I SAW HIM FIN ON
Line_113	IN PLACE OF IT HE WOARE A SHARP STILL HOOK
Line_114	HE STRONGLY APPOSED THIS AS DEPRICIATING THE SHAIRS BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMIZED
Line_115	THEN I SCOUTERED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
Line_116	WHERE AM MY CLOTH WAS HE ASKED VERY INTENTSE
Line_117	I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE HAD COME FROM OR WHAT HEAD DONE
Line_118	SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
Line_119	AT THE SAME INSTENT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEAL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN M LEFT LEG
Line_120	HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEEN AT THE TIME ALL MIGHTY BISY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
Line_121	WELL IT'S THIS THEN I'VE GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOPPED
Line_122	WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
Line_123	I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE AS QUIET
Line_124	I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
Line_125	I'VE BEEN ROBED HE CRIED
Line_126	SOR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IS NO SUDENS SYROUP
Line_127	HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
Line_128	THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LIFT HIS LIPS
Line_129	NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
Line_130	WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE

Line_134	GUESS HE'S SUSPITCIOUS I'VE STOL THAT OLD COTARHERES THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
Line_135	WHEN A MAN BREES THAT WAY HE IS MOSTLY ALL GONE
Line_136	WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAYING GRATITUDE
Line_137	LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SALMAN OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASED TO CALL YOURSELF IL REJOIN TO THIS IF YOURE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAT
Line_138	I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
Line_139	NOW YOURE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
Line_140	HE DID SO AT FAR AWAY SAID I
Line_141	AND A MINNART OR SELL HE CAME TOO
Line_142	ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK NEW MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
Line_143	AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF THIS LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
Line_144	USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
Line_145	IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
Line_146	HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETY SOON HE SORT HAVE WENT TO SLEEP
Line_147	AOWUIEN HE MADMANTEOU F ANTONIO CURVIS SAID HE

Line_149	I STOOD A FOR A LARGER PARTY
Line_150	DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSTME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
Line_151	IT FAIRE MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH A BIG STILL SOLLIM DESERT OUTSIDE N THE QUIET MOONLIGHT IN THE SHADOWSE AND HIM SETTED UP STRAIHT AND GOAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGL NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HEAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
Line_152	I KNOW HE PLEEDED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
Line_153	BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG A BAD
Line_154	AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SALMAN TIMMY FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLE BUT ALTRA GULES AND DIMANS
Line_155	ANY WAY I' THRUST THE MUSEL OF MY COLTS INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
Line_156	AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF SEACED WITH MRACULOUS SUDDENESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIPP DRIPP DRIPP OF EAVES
Line_157	IT'S MONEY I'VE GOT TO HAVE AND ITS MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UN LIST A LITS SOMEBODY IN AS PARTNER
Line_158	HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NOITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
Line_159	THUS THE CAF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
Line_160	WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU SEECED TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGF
Line_161	THE FIRST RAISE OF THE SUN SINDED ACCROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOT MOUNTAINS
Line_162	IMAGINE A PUNCHER TO SCEND INTO EXAMIN POLIGHTLY THE IRETAGS OF WILD CATTL ON THE OPEN RAINGE OR IN AROUND UP
Line_163	UNDOUBTABLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL IT COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVIZED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADDOPTED IN PREFERENCE
Line_164	MARKER YELED THE OTHER
Line_165	MISTER FROSSE'S BULLE CAP ALONE IN PICTORAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
Line_166	HOMAR RAPPED THE ROAP TWICE OR THRISE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIHTEN LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALLENCE
Line_167	FINALLY WOULDN'T DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HEAT POCKET
Line_168	BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DRAWED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
Line_169	NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CA
Line_170	WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
Line_171	THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN OF IT FAILES
Line_172	HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JAHN ROAD IN AMONG THE CATL
Line_173	BUT NOW THE BRANDIAN WAS IN FULL SWING
Line_174	THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN A SOWT GRASS
Line_175	AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
Line_176	THE TWO BUL DAWGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTIM
Line_177	IT SEEMS TO ME TH A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDEN
Line_178	DUST TIED AND DISIPATED
Line_179	INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUFTER FALLOW THE SPRED OF THIS DOCTRIN THROUGH ARASONA
Line_180	SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CABS WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
Line_181	IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
Line_182	I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL COULTURE PERIODTICAL THAT IT CABOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN ORSMANS IN THAT IT EXTRSISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
Line_183	AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CAFF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEASTS WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
Line_184	THE TOTLE AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
Line_185	BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEADS SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
Line_186	MEN RAN TO AND FRO BIZZY AND INTENT
Line_187	I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GADE AMONG APPARANTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINE BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASSES EACH OF WHICH CONCELLED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWINE OF CATTEL AND THE CAROWS
Line_188	WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CROWS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AS DISTANCE
Line_189	WHEN THE NEWSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE REARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
Line_190	ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEEF OF LONG J H STAMPIN IRONS IN HIS HAND
Line_191	IF LUCK ANTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASEME WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CAVE SAID HE
Line_192	THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO IT IT ALONE
Line_193	THE BRAND PRESSED THE IRAND SMOTHELY AGAINST THE FLANK
Line_194	YOU CAN IMAGIN WHAT HAPPEND NEXT
Line_195	PERHAPS THE CALF BLAIDED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
Line_196	BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFE TIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIE TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
Line_197	BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREACEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTL AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILT IN A FIRE NEXED THE FENCE
Line_198	A CA USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRAN BIGHTS BUT AS SOON AS RELIECED HE ALMOST INVERIABLY GOST OF FEATEN OR TO LOOK UN IDELLY ABOUT
Line_199	AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGIOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
Line_200	WHICH YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOE TO YOU OR DEYU RECON YOU COULD TOE THIS FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE OLD IRON

Line_292	EXACTLY REPLIED THE DOCTOR

Line_294	HE AND COLLA WERE WALKING BESIDE THE WEGGON FOR A CHANGE
Line_295	PERHAPS THEY'RE DOGS SAID MAHALLA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SHOOGER CAME DOWN BY AS STREAM
Line_296	MEANWHILE THE HOUGHTY LITTLE BRAMMAN AIGHT HIS SUPER WEN THIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROUD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM

Line_304	THESE THEY YOUSED FOR PLATS HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUTDINGS AND SWEETS
Line_305	EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LASURLY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
Line_306	THE COOK TOO WENT WITH THEM
Line_307	MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRAMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLLY ON THE ARMS THAT AIR GIVEN TO THEM
Line_308	THE'RE OAS BAD AS THE BAGERS
Line_309	HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PREAIERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSEARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
Line_310	AROUND A LITTLE BROWMAN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORDER THRED WHICH WAS THE SINE OF HIS HIGH CAST
Line_311	THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELIFENT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PROWDING HIM ON ONE SIDE WORE THE OTHER WITH AN IRN SHOD STICK OR GOLD
Line_312	OUR PARTY CAME TO A HELT AMONG MANY OTHER BULOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD BY THE LITTLE BOOTH

Line_317	THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE GERNIY
Line_318	I TAKE THEM WITH AN OFFERING TO THE WHOLLY ROVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
Line_319	HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUGG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
Line_320	AS THE WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GRE CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
Line_321	FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELIFENT ALL DECORATED WITH SILKAN GOLD AND SILVER
Line_322	BESIDES THE FAMILY THE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THEIR SLOW MOVING WAGGON
Line_323	GOOD BY SCHOUTED LITTLE NOW FROM HIS GARDEN WALSTEY WENT BY GOOD BY
Line_324	I TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS THE GREAT AND POWERFUL REGIA GOING IN STATE ON A GERNY TO VISIT ANOTHER REGIA WHERE RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MARDERN INDIA WAS FORMALLY MADE UP
Line_325	A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PAROW AND CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
Line_326	THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AS SCODING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BEGS OF FOUD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGEN
Line_327	THE LADISES WERE RAISED A SUCRIA AND HER MOTHER AND AUNT COULD ENJOY THE FRESH AIR
Line_328	BEHIND THE HOUDAS TO A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FETHERS OVER THE RAGAT'S HEAD
Line_329	WHAT ART THOUSE GARDING SO CAREFULLY TRIA ASKED HER BROTHER
Line_330	SMAWDER UNCLE AS HE PATTED HER HEAD
Line_331	THEY SHOUTED GREEDINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE PATER AS THEY PASSED THEM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FACR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CEARS
Line_332	EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY INSPIGHT OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVONTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVEL SPIRITS
Line_333	ON THE ELIFENT'S BACK WHIT WAS THE HOUDEA WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANAPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LIGHT WAS THE RAGA A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLEARED SILKS AND JULS AND THE GREAT DIMEND SET PLOOM IN HIS TURBON
Line_334	NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGERS AS INDIA
Line_335	THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
Line_336	OH THE THES HE CRIED
Line_337	WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
Line_338	THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GO IN TO SCHOOL SAID COLLA AS THE ON PLADDED ALONE THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
Line_339	IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMAL WORKMAN AND WAS CONSEARNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSSELIN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDETS FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
Line_340	SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIERE SQUAR AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY IMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
Line_341	I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNECLIFES THE OTHER NIGHT
Line_342	O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
Line_343	WHAT AN UNSIVLE THING TO SAY SHE MURMERED IN SURPRISE
Line_344	BUT WAS HE ABLE
Line_345	DON'T YOU FEEL LAY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
Line_346	IT WAS UN FAIR TO GO FIRTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHER TWO SUCH EXPLISSITENESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
Line_347	YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACANTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
Line_348	RASING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS REEDING SHE LENT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF CHOKING HERSELF IN LUXORIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMON PLACE WORDS
Line_349	THE LADY ON JOSSELAIN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LOAORD JUSTISS OF OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNEUR TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTERSIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
Line_350	AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAR RETREETED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
Line_351	HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSIT
Line_352	HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATLY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
Line_353	AFTERWARDS THEY CEPT A PART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FARM SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
Line_354	BUT SOME HOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD AL THOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
Line_355	JUST AS THEY TURN MADIEARA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SAID THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITY INDEED
Line_356	SHE THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH A BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATTAIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FAIDED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE OAWRNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
Line_357	THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAIVED
Line_358	LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICKLA PINE EVEN
Line_359	HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEVEN'S EYES THOGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DEETAILES
Line_360	AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COOD
Line_361	SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
Line_362	JOSELIN PEERSTEN
Line_363	SAID MISSUS PINE EVEN WITH A START
Line_364	BUT JOSOLIM WAS RECEEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
Line_365	SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
Line_366	BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
Line_367	IT IS RATHER UNSIVLE
Line_368	THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
Line_369	I'D SOON AS YOU DAN MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEET HEART
Line_370	IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
Line_371	IFILY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
Line_372	AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND RIGHT A LETTER TO MY LOORD
Line_373	I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEASTE
Line_374	AND A BLUE ONE TO BE BARRIED IN HELL AS ME
Line_375	WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOILE MISTER THWEGES SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOILE OVER
Line_376	BUT THE COUNTES NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
Line_377	OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM CURTIOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH ONEUSTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLANT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LEVELE FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULY
Line_378	WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLS MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
Line_379	MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
Line_380	THEY ARE POLES A THUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
Line_381	I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOLD BE CEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
Line_382	WHEN YOU WERE FORMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
Line_383	BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
Line_384	IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
Line_385	PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEN
Line_386	AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVER OF AN ARISTOCRASY OF BIRTH
Line_387	THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOAT RITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
Line_388	IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOOD AND MUST TEND
Line_389	I CAN TOOTH HAT TOO
Line_390	BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUN AND MEARRITE IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELED FROM THE ONE POLL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
Line_391	THEY HAD NOT REALISED THE FORE OF THE ELIMENTS TILL NOW
Line_392	THE ILAND WAS AN ILAND STILL
Line_393	MY FATHER SHE BIRSED OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVIGENCE
Line_394	AH I SHOULD THINK SO
Line_395	THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
Line_396	HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTERWARDE TIME
Line_397	HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
Line_398	BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ILAND HERE THIS SEASON
Line_399	WAS THAT THIS EVENING
Line_400	BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
Line_401	I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
Line_402	MY FATHERS IS A A COMPARITATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENT HARD BY
Line_403	NOW I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUBATH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
Line_404	THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
Line_405	BY THE ADE OF SOME TEMPORY RAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE COUBERD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFOTORBLE WHEN THE MADE SERVANT CAME DOWN STARS WITH A DAMP ARMFULL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
Line_406	HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN ENICIATED DURING THE WALK
Line_407	OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
Line_408	HE IS MY FATHER INDEED
Line_409	BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF SENSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
Line_410	I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO NOWLEDGE OF YOU
Line_411	THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISTION LED TO THE WITH DRAWL OF A BOULT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASTLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
Line_412	WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
Line_413	IT IS SO LATE THAT THE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN ECEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
Line_414	YOU HAVE HEARD SO
Line_415	HE PITTYED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMAIRED HER DETERMINATION
Line_416	GOSOLEIN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOUL BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTEGUS TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPIDETS
Line_417	I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TEL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
Line_418	YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PERSTON
Line_419	HE STUDDYED HER BODILLY BY INCERCLING HER WASTE WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
Line_420	AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE EV HIS CARROW
Line_421	HE FELT REVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SAT ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COOD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
Line_422	STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTABLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIAR OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIGHT AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BIRSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
Line_423	THEN A MORTEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
Line_424	BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOUSEN YARDS
Line_425	THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
Line_426	GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
Line_427	WHEN I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
Line_428	AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICLTY THROUGH THE FLUFPHY ATMESFEAR
Line_429	THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PROCISION ANY IREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WORLPULL
Line_430	AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
Line_431	TWO THREE
Line_432	THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXCHERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
Line_433	NOT LONG AFTER A FOARM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
Line_434	IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
Line_435	THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
Line_436	IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIABLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SELICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISS GIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXIRSISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPERTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASST BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
Line_437	AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DUE WHAT THEN
Line_438	I HAVE MONEY
Line_439	FORE FIVE
Line_440	I ASK WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
Line_441	HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
Line_442	HOW MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
Line_443	THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSETIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
Line_444	THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
Line_445	IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENIEETH
Line_446	SAID THE BLIRD SPOTT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
Line_447	BESIDES I NEAD YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUTTIN BERTROM CRAFTILY
Line_448	BILLY LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEAT HER LOVER'S EYES
Line_449	YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARCRIHTE
Line_450	A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS NEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTROM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
Line_451	PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANA
Line_452	THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTROM STIRD
Line_453	PET GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PET'S LIPS TWITCHED
Line_454	AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
Line_455	SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTROMS INCIRCLING ARM
Line_456	BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
Line_457	IT WAS AUNT HANNA'S PLANTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
Line_458	BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECICIVELY
Line_459	WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENCE LAW
Line_460	IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLE CLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILETES AND LACE ROUGFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT

Line_467	FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
Line_468	BILLY YOURE A QUIVERING SAG
Line_469	HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER ILIDS
Line_470	AUNT HANNA'S CHEEKS TWO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STORRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PET HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
Line_471	DAHNGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLLISHING A SILVAR TEESPOON WITH A FRINGE NAPCAIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAMS TREY
Line_472	RETORTED AUNT HANNA TESTERLY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PET WHERE IS HE

Line_485	BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTROM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKRIGHTS
Line_486	BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END F THE HALL AUNT HANNA'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
Line_487	YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WILE CUT IN BERTRM MERRILY

Line_493	THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTROM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT

Line_792	AND AFTER MID DAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMSLE ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A NIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS AMOUR
Line_793	AND EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
Line_794	AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULLNESS OF JOY AND HONOUR TO THEM FOR GERAIN TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR OMEGE
Line_795	AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTILL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
Line_796	I AM LORD SAID HE AND I HAVE MET WITH MUCH TROUBLE AND RECEIVED WOUNDS UNSUPPORTABLE
Line_797	AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSETIONS
Line_798	TO GUENVER IN HER HAND MAIDEN SAID HE
Line_799	AND IN AS MUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDNIERUN THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
Line_800	AND WHEN GERAIN CAME TO THE PLACE WIG WENTEVER WAS HE SURLUTED HER

Line_802	AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST GERNYING TOWARDS A SEVERIN
Line_803	SIR SAID SHE WHEN THINKEST THOU THAT JERAIN WILL BE HERE
Line_804	LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE IS A NIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
Line_805	AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHER INTENDED TO GO AWAY
Line_806	SO HE RECEIVED THE OMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
Line_807	AND GERAIN GREETES THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSALT WHICH THY MAIDEN RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NO WAIRE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE
Line_808	AND HE SAID TO JGERIENT I AM A FEABLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINIONS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO

Line_810	ONE WISHED THAT IT HOUL BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BE LOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
Line_811	WHAT DISCOURSE SAID GWENNEVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
Line_812	THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
Line_813	HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHER AND THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
Line_814	AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABOD IN THE PALLICSE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND IT WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEMED THAN SHE IN THE ILAND OF BRITTEN
Line_815	I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM GERAIN PERSUED AND ME THINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
Line_816	THEN SHE REPLIED I KNOW HIM KNOT
Line_817	THE MERSY WHICH THOU DESIROEST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANT TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
Line_818	AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEFIOUW AND AS A VASSLE SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
Line_819	SOR GOUENEVER WENT TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED
Line_820	BUT GERAIN HAS OVER TAKEN HIM AND AVENGE THE INSULT TO THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
Line_821	AND FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME HIS WIFE
Line_822	THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO DOS SAID ARTHER LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDTICAL CARE UNTILL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE MAY LIVE
Line_823	AND THE LAST DOG THAT WAS LET LOOSE WAS A FAVERIET DOG OF ARTHER CAVALL WAS HIS NAME
Line_824	THEN JERAINESEND EMBASCIDES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MIS
Line_825	AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GROW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODREAD ARTHER'S NEFOU AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIHTING FOR THE KING

Line_828	SAID JERAINTE I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF NIGHT HOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
Line_829	IN ITS NATURE INFINAT
Line_830	MUST NECESSARILY EXIST
Line_831	ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTREBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINAT OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINAT THROUGH THE SAID ATREBUTE
Line_832	AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DIRATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORSE HAVE EXISTED WITH OUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HIPOTHESCIS TFHOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THERE FROME
Line_833	PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT THE SOMETHING IN SOME ATTREBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINIGHT AND HAS A CONDITION EXISTANCE OR DRATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESS IN THE ATTRABUTES THOUGHT
Line_834	CORELARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATREBUTES OF GOD FORM MODES BY WHICH THE ATREBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFENATE MANNER
Line_835	WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOGD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HIPOTHOSIS
Line_836	CORELARIY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTANCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTANCE THAT IS IN SCOLASTIC FRASIOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS AS SINDY RERAM
Line_837	BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATRBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE

Line_845	HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
Line_846	NECK MODERATLY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DUELAP
Line_847	IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELCH SOUTHERN OR AOTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELCH ROUGH COATED BEAGL OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESEXS BEAGL

Line_875	WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUASITE FOR DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLM
Line_876	THE ONLY DESCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROW EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SERVAYS
Line_877	THE OFFICSORS OF THESE REGUMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SUELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN THE SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM SIVEL LIFE
Line_878	UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVIZED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDENCE WITH THIS NEW ELIMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
Line_879	THE QUOARTER MASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORME ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
Line_880	I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO AFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
Line_881	AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITERS WITH DREW DISATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
Line_882	HIS INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOUDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A CORSER GRAIN FOR OARTILLOARY
Line_883	SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VERIOUS ROUBTS SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITH IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
Line_884	I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITELE

Line_900	IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO RONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARSE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
Line_901	IF YOU RIT DOWN MINUTLY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLYEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEFE SHALL BE MACURED TO VENERATION

Line_905	THIS IDAL CHARGE HAS BEEN ECCOWED FROM ONE BABOLAR TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXSACOHNE OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT ATHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTO WOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
Line_906	SCOLLORS FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES

Line_925	WHY MAN YOU HESITATE
Line_926	I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDRAL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN OUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
Line_927	EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREACED MY ADMIERATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
Line_928	THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
Line_929	THE RECHUEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREETING YOU IN THAT WAY
Line_930	YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SENCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCOLENT OFFER OF EMPLOIMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
Line_931	MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
Line_932	IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRID SHE REPEATED

Line_947	I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
Line_948	I COULD AONESTLY PROMISS THAT
Line_949	IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
Line_950	MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINE TO PERSU

Line_977	WHAT RONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
Line_978	IN MY REASON TRAVELES IN THE VEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEABLE AND INEFECTUAL
Line_979	THE GREAT EPICK OF THE SAOWL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHEARPARTITHER GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPEARAMENT
Line_980	IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INOTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TROUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY THOUTH WITHIN ITS BOWNEFRES AND OUTSIDE
Line_981	THE SAME THING AS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST

Line_992	IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INNOTE CONSTRUCTION
Line_993	THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMASFER OF THE VEST

Line_1282	AND HOW AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
Line_1283	A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GARDS AND A MAN IN THE COURTBELT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
Line_1284	IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY O THE SEVERANCE
Line_1285	HIS WERLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVETY
Line_1286	AND DISPARE IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHENT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDAIY'S POMES THE OCSON
Line_1287	THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PROSAYIC EXAGURATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMEGE IN THE LAST LINE
Line_1288	HE IS NOT BY TEMPRMENT O SINGER
Line_1289	WHEN WE HAS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR KATORING CARE VAILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
Line_1290	LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
Line_1291	TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDAY IS NEITHER SUFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NORE SUFICIENTLY FESTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POWET
Line_1292	WHEN SHALL THE SAINER SOFTER POLITIES WHERE WE DREAME HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIATISM GROWING GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEATHES
Line_1293	TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITENCES OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
Line_1294	HE CAN ENTER UPON A WALL WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
Line_1295	ONE CAN REMEMBER PALM AFTER PALM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDEY TOO LATE CRISTEENA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
Line_1296	HIS LOVERS LICK HIS SOULDERS ROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFATED OF THEIR GLORY
Line_1297	AND GENERAL HOLE HOLD OUT HER SWEET HEARTS SWORN LOAL AS DOVES
Line_1298	THE RE WELL TO MISTER HARDEY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDIOUS IRRELEVENCE
Line_1299	THUS HE ROUGHTS IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
Line_1300	HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
Line_1301	IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDAY'S POIMES ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FRUTILITY THAN HIS POIMS ABOUT LOVE
Line_1302	HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POME RITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
Line_1303	AND PROSIN TRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
Line_1304	FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LOARNELY WATE MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
Line_1305	IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
Line_1306	NO SHADE OF PINNICL OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH IN JORS WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE OUER STILL UNTO YORS ONE ROBEN NEVER HOUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTORES
Line_1307	SOME FICCLE AND FLET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
Line_1308	THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
Line_1309	BUT WHAT A SENSE OF CTHRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNAIN'S TRAGIDIES
Line_1310	BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GREAVE PART STILLS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FREAGIL FRAME AT EAVE WITH THROBINGS OF NOON TIDE
Line_1311	TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDAY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DAPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
Line_1312	HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIGPHE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
Line_1313	MISTER HARDEY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELADBE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WALL
Line_1314	AND OUR WIVES QUATH ANOTHER RESINEDLY DOULLE THEY ON OUR DEEDS
Line_1315	THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STILE OF LYIRIC POWITRY IN THESE LINES BUT FRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE OUR STROKED ITS THUMB ARE DISCOURDES THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELES OF VICTORIAN COMMON PLACE
Line_1316	WE PICTURED THE MEAK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWEALT IN THIS STORY PEN NORE DID IT ACCEARE TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE NEALING THEN
Line_1317	HE HAS A TEMPRMENT SENCITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT RIGHTERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
Line_1318	THE MODE OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDAY'S PREVAILING MOOD
Line_1319	FUTILITY AND FRESTRATION ARE EVER REQUARING THEMS IN BOTH
Line_1320	NOTHING OF TINEYEST WIRTH HAVE I ROUGHT PONDERED PLANED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAYZSE SINCE THE PALE COARPS LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIERNAL UNET BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYZSE DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYZSE
Line_1321	BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTARISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POME THE SOLS OF THE SLAINE IN WHICH THE SOLS OF THE DEAD SOLDGIERS RETURNED TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SEENIOUR SOLFLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELITIVES HAVE CEPT THEIR DOUBTY DADES IN REMEMBERANCE
Line_1322	CATERING CAIRE IS AN APPAWLING FRAZE
Line_1323	TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE YOUSE OF THE WORD DOMESILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POM ABOUT
Line_1324	YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DROUWE ON AND WAR ME NUMB YET LOSS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THITHE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIRE COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVER BEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPEBOWER STROKED ITS THUMB YOU DID NOT COME
Line_1325	HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARES THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
Line_1326	THAT IS WHY CRIMAN PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENCARENENA OF FATHERS AND SONS
Line_1327	ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIET ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PANCIAN PRINCE ES ADALADA EIVENOVENA LIZAVETA PROCOFIOVENA YAVGENY PAVELOVICH REDONSKY PRINCES PERELACONSKY AGLAYIA PRINCE MISKN COIAR EVOLGOLN IPOLIT VIA FEDISHENCO NISTARSCIA FHILAPOVENA NINA ALEXANGOVENA GONIA TITSON EN GENERAL EVOLGON
Line_1328	EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER O HARDLY EVER THE LOUST OF A MORE OR LESS SAIN MAN
Line_1329	IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
Line_1330	BUT THE SACRED OF DOUSTIEVSKIY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOLTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
Line_1331	AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTAL MAKNESS SAN ON THE IMMEGES OF OLDS THEVOINIC SAINTS
Line_1332	IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DUSTIESKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR ALSO
Line_1333	THE ALTERNATE ATTITUDE OF DEUSTAIESKY IS AS CRISTION AS THE APPOSTAL PEATERS LORD I BELIEVE HELPED THOU MIN ON BELIEFE
Line_1334	CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUSTER DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTIONS SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DEOUSTAISKIS MEAN AND WOMAN
Line_1335	WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BUARING THEM WITH GREAT SERIMONY
Line_1336	AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENCES OF DIELOGU THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SEROUNDING DARKNESS
Line_1337	WE SYMPATHISED INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BREVADOR THE DESPARE THAT SUCCAD THE CRIME
Line_1338	HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH GELISY OR FALL IN EPOLEPTIC FITS ORL RAVE HISTERICALLY
Line_1339	DEUSTIESKE IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
Line_1340	THERE IS IN DOSTAIESKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SIR TABLES
Line_1341	LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVEALIST OF TORCHER
Line_1342	MISTER MARRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFICLTY AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFONITION
Line_1343	ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MOLTPLICITY OF ACTION
Line_1344	NO MELLEGAMATIST EVER PORED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
Line_1345	SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DIMIETRY BRETHLESSLY
Line_1346	AS FOR THE CARAMESOVES THEMSELVES HE BETRASED THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACKS
Line_1347	THAT IS A PORTHRET OF THE MAN ONE SAYS BEHIND DOUSTEFSKEY'S KNOBELES A PORTCHRET ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERED FROM THE KNOBLES
Line_1348	WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEETED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
Line_1349	ALTERNATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
Line_1350	AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VECOMNTER DIVALQEAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
Line_1351	IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES ENDREPELLS
Line_1352	HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUCIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIME TURNED HIS EYES HEVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVANTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CRIST SAKE
Line_1353	TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTAYISK HIS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTELES WITH DOUBT AND DENIEL AND DESPARE
Line_1354	THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
Line_1355	BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALLANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DIMONICAL CONFLICTS
Line_1356	AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISIPATING THE NIGHT GAUSTESKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CRISTIAN COMPASSION
Line_1357	IF DOSTIESKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAEBEEN STRINBERG
Line_1358	TO HIM DOSTEISK HIS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
Line_1359	HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTAIEFSKY OR A NOT MARRIED DOSTAIEFSKY
Line_1360	HE IS A GROTESK MADE ALIVE BY SHERE IMAGINATIVE INTENCITY AND PASSION
Line_1361	HE ENVENTS VICIOUS GROTES AS DICKENS ADVENTS COMIC GROTESCS
Line_1362	THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOMEONE IN THE ITIOUS
Line_1363	THE NOVELES ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
Line_1364	EVEN THE TALK HIS OLDE ACTIONS MORE THAN OF BY DEAERS
Line_1365	HE MAY NOT BE A CROUAL ALSO
Line_1366	DEOUSTIESKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NECLIDOVE IN RESERECTION
Line_1367	HE SAW HIS VILENT DABES NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
Line_1368	ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTISTS AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
Line_1369	BECAUSE THEY ARE POSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MAN AND WOMAN
Line_1370	OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINSE MISKEN IN THE ITIET
Line_1371	BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BED CHAIN WHICH IT SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
Line_1372	SHUORELY TWO GARS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
Line_1373	SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DOYOU THINK OF MY NIESES
Line_1374	THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
Line_1375	THEY CALLED ME BEATH SILENLY

Line_1411	HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOK ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUSION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE

Line_1785	SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE FPESITIONS KNOW NOTHING
Line_1786	I HAD HARBERED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPESHIES OF DRY S AB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HAND
Line_1787	I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BOLL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CAN NOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
Line_1788	AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
Line_1789	YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISIETE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETORATE FOLE AND THEIR DEVOTEDE FRIEND AND YET THE POP AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FOLT OF YOURS

Line_1798	I THEREFORE DIS MOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOULING PIEACE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RAINCHE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL

Line_1800	I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
Line_1801	MASTER FRANCHESCOL USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWARE BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COOD HE WOULD HAVE ROBED ME OF THE DIE FOR THAT MEADDOW
Line_1802	HE REPEATED GET HENT AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGENCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
Line_1803	WHEN I REACHED HOME NICOLOUR DAMONTEIAGOUTOU CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD EXCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERIELS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN RITTEN WITH INDELLABLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HAST TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY GAPADY CAME FROM A QUOARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME

Line_1809	THIS MAIDE HAD STOLLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
Line_1810	BUT IN THE STATE OF TH INNOSENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEKENESS OF OLD AGE
Line_1811	THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PERFECT IMBODYDE SIZE AND POWER
Line_1812	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOSENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRY NATOR'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CARMONLY WITH MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
Line_1813	ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED THIS FIRSTING PERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOSENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGAIDED BY GENERATION
Line_1814	THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DELL WITH SUCH AS LOVED THE LORD
Line_1815	CRISTION I HAVE COME TO SEE T A GOOD MAN AT THE HOUSE
Line_1816	HE NOW WENT ON TIL HE COME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR F WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS E DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
Line_1817	AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PREY WHAT ARE THE AUTS
Line_1818	WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LEN SAID CRISTION
Line_1819	HOW FOO THAT I AM SETTING TO SLEEPING THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO YUSE FOR YEAS THAT REST WHICH IT LORD AFAHIEW HAVE MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOL
Line_1820	CHARITY TE WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
Line_1821	AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LOW THREE BROUGHT ONES KENTHAME AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEASE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
Line_1822	WITH WHAT A LI THAT DID HE KNOW CLUE THE HEEL
Line_1823	HE SAIL FOREED BUT SOUNDED NOT
Line_1824	IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
Line_1825	THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETOR TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
Line_1826	TIMMORERS SAID THAT SAIN WAS FOR HEEL THEY MEANT TO CLIME BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
Line_1827	CRISTION SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MONTSIEN
Line_1828	SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS NEES TO BRAYE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL MISSACT AND THEN WHENT BACKTO LOOKE FOR HIS CROB
Line_1829	WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CRISTION WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS ROW
Line_1830	FOR MADEST AND HIPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF BEING GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT IN FOR PRAYS
Line_1831	NOW WHEN CRISTION GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRAGN UFLIVE HE DREMT OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
Line_1832	YES SAID MISTRUST FOR CHEST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SNLEPPED OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LINGS
Line_1833	HAH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGING THE NOD FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD Y FLY FROM THEM
Line_1834	CRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAINED AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAZE IS THIS BLAST CRAS BLEAST TOON
Line_1835	BUT THEY WOULD NOW COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAZEN
Line_1836	YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUNDING HIS CLOAK FOR HIS CROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND ITS ON PEACE
Line_1837	JUST AS TRISTION CAME UP TO THE CROWCE HIS LOADS SLITT FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOOM WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
Line_1838	THEN THEY TOLDING IT WAS SNGMANEOUS LEND
Line_1839	YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
Line_1840	PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKE SHOULD WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MANKDAYEN
Line_1841	THEN I SAW IN MY DREM THAT STEEL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WILDE BEASTS I HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY DO HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHFUL DROUT
Line_1842	CRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
Line_1843	FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOWNED BY CHANGE AND ARE COOT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NOWN
Line_1844	HE STOOED AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
Line_1845	THEN CRISTION BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIM TO THE HOUSE
Line_1846	HIGHTEY CALM GOOD CRISTIAN SEINGS OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE HEALING TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FALL THAT SHOULD HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
Line_1847	I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I COME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
Line_1848	HOW FAR MUD I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
Line_1849	NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VAILE ONCE MORE WHERE FOURS FELL HE SAT DOWN IN WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROWL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOKE
Line_1850	CRISTION WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
Line_1851	KEEP IN THE MISTER OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
Line_1852	CRISTION SIR WHAT HOUSE IF THIS MAY A REST HERE TONIGHT
Line_1853	HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREST OF HIS COT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
Line_1854	HE WENT ON THURSE TILL HE CAME TO A VAILE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
Line_1855	NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HE THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
Line_1856	WHEN WATCHFOL TOLD HER WHY QUISTION HAD COME THITERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_1857	KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMES UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THEFE
Line_1858	CRISTION SIERS WHEN S COME YOU AND WHERE DOU TO GO
Line_1859	SUCH WAS THE LAUGHT OF THE JOS FOR THIS SING THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RE SEE AND I AM MADE TO TRAY THOSE STEPS WITH WRAVE WHICH ONE MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS LEAVE
Line_1860	CRISTION WHAT MEANS THESE
Line_1861	I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TIL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFICALTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
Line_1862	AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASK WITH WHICH SINSEND IS SUCH RAY FEETS AND THE SLAINE AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DABITSLEW GALIATH OF GAPH
Line_1863	THEN YOUR NACX THOUGHT A MADE COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO HE SEEM MADE CLEANG AND LAIDE LOW BY FAVING THE BOOK
Line_1864	THUSE DID QUESTION TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GROW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO A LARGE ROON THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PIEACE THERE HE SLAPPED TIL IT BRAKE DAY AND THEN HE SAID AHEAM
Line_1865	CHARITY HAVE YOUR WIFE AND BABES CRISTION YES I HAVE
Line_1866	THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO CEPT THE LOADGE OF THEIR HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW AT CRISTION MADE HEARD AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS BY STRENTH SO SMALL
Line_1867	THEY TOLD QUESTION THAT HE HAD KNOWN IT FOR CARE ON TESCORE FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SILVER YEARS
Line_1868	THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LEAD IT THE ANIMOST TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
Line_1869	OBJECTION ONE IT WAS SEEN THAT INNESIVENESENS MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
Line_1870	THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
Line_1871	THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NORE THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOS PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
Line_1872	NOW IN MANE REASON HAST THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
Line_1873	THEREFORE IN THE STAIT OF INNESENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMOS
Line_1874	NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAIDED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ECENCIAL AND UNIVERSAL
Line_1875	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD IS BAD NOTHING DISABAIDE HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
Line_1876	IN A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO A RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFACTFAL NATURE
Line_1877	I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMATIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SECTURLE UNI HAVE BEEN STERAL
Line_1878	SECONDLY THIS ASPROVED BY THE ORDER OF A DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWS GOVERNS INFEAR WITH THINGS BY THE SUPERO
Line_1879	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF IM SENSE MAN WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
Line_1880	FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE TO BE MASTER OVER A MAN
Line_1881	SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATOF NESS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
Line_1882	THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUDETLY DESPARITY
Line_1883	SO ALL ENIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS ABAY HIM
Line_1884	OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF HIM SENSE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSKED OVER A MAN
Line_1885	THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FETTING THE STATE INSENCE MAN HAD NOT BEANIN OVER PLENS
Line_1886	MUCH LESS FEAREFORE WOULD I HAVE A BEAT MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOSENCE
Line_1887	IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO IN KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAST THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CAUGHT A MASTER
Line_1888	THIRTELY THIS HAS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
Line_1889	AND BY THIS ACT WE KILLE OUR SOLS AS WELL
Line_1890	SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
Line_1891	COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID KRISHIAM LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
Line_1892	THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIRE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WEGG IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOULD LYE ITS MYIGNE
Line_1893	THUS WHY ONE KNOCKED HIS LIFE FOR THE TROOTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TRAVE THE SAME WAY WAS QUESTION
Line_1894	MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAY ALONG YOU MY LORD WHERE ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
Line_1895	THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KANGS SPOKE THUS YOU'LL SEE IF THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING NOR TOWN
Line_1896	HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CRISTION GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
Line_1897	HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
Line_1898	JGERGE THY JUST DOOME WOULD BE TO DARREY ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
Line_1899	QUESTION WHERE YOU MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK

Line_1920	SPEAKING OF TELLS DARRIS I WONCE GOD TELLING A MANSTORRIS AT THE HERISON LEATEN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
Line_1921	OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WEATEN AND RA BUT WHIE GANIAL INTRESTWRAS ARROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC

Line_1923	SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WRAPS PLENTY
Line_1924	WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETNESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO REA CAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THRANTS WOVEAN ING AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
Line_1925	HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITO TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OUT HIS CRUD CONCEPTIONS BUT IN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST F PERSONAL SURENDER

Line_1941	YET THE VERY BOGAR OF THE ELECTRIC ARTLIGHTE MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCONDESSANT
Line_1942	FORTHE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERIDABA BE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
Line_1943	I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SEECR EVEN IF I LOCKED THE MAB IN MY DASK THEY WOULD BRAKE IT OPEN
Line_1944	HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ABICIN STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE MATHERDS THEY INVALVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PERSENT
Line_1945	IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODEN LINING COMPANY SUPPLISED TO ITS COUSTOMRIST BOTH INCONDESTANT AND ARKLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DINAMAL ELECTRIC MASHEENARY AS SORS OF CURRENT AND THOU THE OR FUD AS BETWEEN THE RIBALESISTANCE HAST DIED OUT
Line_1946	THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARED
Line_1947	IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PASSED THER RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC THINE ESSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ATICON LINING COMPTAS IN HE LIVING CITIS
Line_1948	ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEEPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
Line_1949	THUS IN THE CUROS MANNER THE MODENARD OF ELECTRY LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVORIES AND GELISSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCURDING FELT WHERE ALTIMATE UNING ON THE FORCE WAS IN EVITIABLE
Line_1950	THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LATOR GASS ENGING WAS RATHER STARTLING
Line_1951	THIS WAS NOT LAWN NOW UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRITS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIS THE ELECTRIC AND GUESS PROVES ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ELUMINANTS
Line_1952	HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THE UM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESOUT

Line_1961	AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE YOUSED TO CALL AT SECUTIFIED LATE A NIGHT WITH HIS VIELINCH
Line_1962	THERE ALSO THE MOST PEATER FEELING WAS SHOWN
Line_1963	HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIVE LADIES AND HALF A GREAT TIME

Line_2295	I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE AFFECT UPON HIS HELTH JASPER
Line_2296	OUR DIFICELETIES ARE SO GRAIVE THAT
Line_2297	THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
Line_2298	HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
Line_2299	THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
Line_2300	I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEART BROKEN IN ANY VENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVERIABLE WHAT CAN I DO
Line_2301	EVEN IF MISTER YUWL RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
Line_2302	YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
Line_2303	THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
Line_2304	I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
Line_2305	I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOSE
Line_2306	HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
Line_2307	HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DISPONDANTLY
Line_2308	IT ISN'T YOUR FALT MARRIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
Line_2309	YOU WERE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOSE YOU
Line_2310	WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARRIAN
Line_2311	YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IT MY WORK RECENTLY
Line_2312	SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
Line_2313	HE KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
Line_2314	YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPAR
Line_2315	WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TIRE CHANCE
Line_2316	JESPR DELIED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
Line_2317	I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
Line_2318	AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLOUWOUS MOMENT
Line_2319	SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TUTCHINGLY
Line_2320	HER EMOTION HAD AN AFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
Line_2321	IS IT HINMOY POWENT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
Line_2322	THE RAIN FELL UNSEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AORTMDON MIST
Line_2323	AIM MIGHT TAKE A FORMOST PLACE AMONG BRILDIAN WOMEN
Line_2324	BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
Line_2325	RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
Line_2326	DEYOUR I CANT FEAL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLOIED
Line_2327	IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
Line_2328	DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
Line_2329	EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DIS HEARTEN ME
Line_2330	GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARRIAN I CANT STAND IT
Line_2331	YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
Line_2332	DORONT LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEEDED
Line_2333	I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARRIAN WHAT
Line_2334	ACCEPT JASPAR THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
Line_2335	HE SENT ME A COPPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
Line_2336	WILL YOU LET ME HERE OR COME AND SEE ME
Line_2337	HOW AM I TO LIVE AN OUR IN SUCH UNSERTAINTY AS THIS
Line_2338	BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO ENVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
Line_2339	A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL
Line_2340	SHE HAD DEVOINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMENSE AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
Line_2341	WHY NEADE YOU CONSEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TROUTH
Line_2342	MORE OF A BREE YOU MEAN
Line_2343	I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL RIGHT TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
Line_2344	HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARRIAN WHO WAS FAITS INSTROMENT
Line_2345	PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IM PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
Line_2346	GASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVIEAR HUMILIATION
Line_2347	HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERTE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWYSE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
Line_2348	I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
Line_2349	YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
Line_2350	TO SHUFFL OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IKNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
Line_2351	BUT WHY THE JIOSE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
Line_2352	YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNAN THAT IN DESPIGHT OF REASON AND DESOIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
Line_2353	I SCARSELY THOUGHT OF DIFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
Line_2354	UN ABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REAGENTS PARK
Line_2355	THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SUERRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PEARANTS
Line_2356	YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
Line_2357	SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
Line_2358	OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
Line_2359	HAPPINESS OR MISARY COME TO US BY FIGHT
Line_2360	I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
Line_2361	GOOD BY SHE GAVE HIM HER CANT
Line_2362	BECAUSE IN HIS SELLO DIZE HE DALLEYED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHAMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACREFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTATCHMENT
Line_2363	JUST NOW H I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOUREGEMENT
Line_2364	HAS ONE THING ACCURD TO YOU
Line_2365	HER STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PIPE HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
Line_2366	THERE WAS SILENCE
Line_2367	POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
Line_2368	THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARRIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
Line_2369	I SERMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
Line_2370	WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NAWL
Line_2371	I DO WISH IT
Line_2372	WILL HE CONCENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVIN
Line_2373	ASKED AIM COMPASSIONATELY
Line_2374	PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARRIAN
Line_2375	WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
Line_2376	IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TROUTH
Line_2377	GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARRIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
Line_2378	IS IT SO SERIOUS
Line_2379	BUT I WILL SEE WELPDAIL I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME
Line_2380	REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DIS REGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND NAIVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
Line_2381	WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS IT'S STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_2382	IS THAT WHAT YOU MEEN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
Line_2383	MARRIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOTHE COUNTENANCE
Line_2384	I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
Line_2385	YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
Line_2386	HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS AMBROWA IVER HER BUT MARRIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENIETH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
Line_2387	I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT AIR RAFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
Line_2388	YES
Line_2389	BUT SHALL HE FACE THEM WILLINGLY
Line_2390	WAS HE STILL SO VERY POORE
Line_2391	ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSIOM YES
Line_2392	AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
Line_2393	IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
Line_2394	ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLOINDNESS
Line_2395	YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPAR AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
Line_2396	DO YOU THINK THEM INSERMOUNTABLE
Line_2397	MARRIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITH OUT HER MEETING DURING THAT TIME
Line_2398	SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
Line_2399	THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGTE DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
Line_2400	THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MANIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TROUTH
Line_2401	HE ROAT TO MARRING HIM
Line_2402	IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
Line_2403	AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
Line_2404	AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT RIST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIME UPON HER
Line_2405	SOON ENOUGH HE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERRITED MY PERVIERSE PRIDE WOULD REVULT AGAINST IT
Line_2406	HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES AND ASPECT
Line_2407	A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOAS NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLITEST AFFECTION BUT WHO AS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FULISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
Line_2408	WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TROUTH
Line_2409	ALASS POR YORRICK
Line_2410	INTREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASIENS THE PERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAMENT OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFEIRVERALIVE TILL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVEL OWER POP COMES A CREDITER UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPALE UPON THE SPOT TOGETHER WITH FULL INTREST TO THE VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR OBLICATIONS
Line_2411	AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR RIVES HAS A THORROR KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HEAROW COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MMENTOS

Line_196	IS THEIR HOPES SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT OUTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
Line_197	AND HOW ABOUT THE TOOERE ABROAUD ASKED TH FAMILY DOCTOR
Line_198	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
Line_199	SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
Line_200	OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCES COME THIS WAY
Line_201	WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH OF LOWERING IT
Line_202	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
Line_203	BEG PARDN IS THE EULSKEE BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
Line_204	AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SIENTIPHICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELIGANT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
Line_205	THE PRINCESS WAS DESTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SENT AGAINST KITTY
Line_206	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEARFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEARFUL
Line_207	HE ASKED AH IT IS
Line_208	BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PERLS
Line_209	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FAIT SAID THE PRINCES TELL ME EVERYTHING
Line_210	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
Line_211	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
Line_212	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
Line_213	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUVISION AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTONS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCRESCED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
Line_214	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCRESE OF DISADVANTAGES
Line_215	AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MENT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROUPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
Line_216	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPOR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DESCENTIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
Line_217	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDIPENDANT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
Line_218	GOVERMENT ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
Line_219	THE MEANING OF GAPPRIVIYS SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUEGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREN FOS BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICORS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE INSLAVE TOILING MASSES
Line_220	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
Line_221	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVEL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
Line_222	EVERY INCRECE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIME OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMOLAR INCRECE IN THEIR ARMIES
Line_223	THE TACXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBE THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
Line_224	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WELTHY CLASS AND APPRESSER
Line_225	AND SO EVERY GOVERMENT NEADS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGENDS
Line_226	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ECENCIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSHIAN ATHORITIES OF TADAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTER THERE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTEARS
Line_227	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST
Line_228	THE CHAMPIANS O THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRIE TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF ATTHORITY THAT IS OF VILENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLOUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_229	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VILENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION THAT GIVES US FROM EVEL DISPOSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FORE SENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHAT EVER KNOW
Line_230	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFELE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIALBORD
Line_231	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDERDS OF MORALS AN THE DISPOSITION OF MEN OF VILENCE THE EXISTANCE OF AN ATHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VILENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VILENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
Line_232	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
Line_233	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAN THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSESTSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
Line_234	IN FACT THE WHOLE SGNIFICENT OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBEARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSTORIENUSS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIME OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
Line_235	THE RIVALRY OF THE YURAPIAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FOURSES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSED TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE
Line_236	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BACIS OF POWER
Line_237	THE GREAT EXTENTION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AE IN FORMING SUCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPARATIONS AND CONGRESES FOR SIENTIPIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
Line_238	THE GOVERMET THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT INSLAVE US
Line_239	WITHOUT GOVERMENTS NATIONS WOLD BE INSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
Line_240	THE DESPATISM OF THE GOVERMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPATISM
Line_241	AND THEREFORE THE PPRESSION OF THE UPPRESST ALWAYS GOS ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LEMEN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EX
Line_242	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME SENTORIS AGO
Line_243	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPACK WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUWED BY CONQUEST
Line_244	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWYSE
Line_245	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROLL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN SEASERS TO THE RUSHIAN AND GERMAN EMPARS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF FAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
Line_246	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLOUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDENCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
Line_247	GOVERN ATHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VILENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VILENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERMENT
Line_248	THE BACES OF ATHORITY IS BODILY VILENCE
Line_249	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BRAKE OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIALIFE VAN AND FRUTLESS
Line_250	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION COULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
Line_251	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BOTTLE VILENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
Line_252	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WANG THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LADE ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE IT IT FOR HIM PERSIONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DOMENDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFEUWS TO DO SO
Line_253	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE ATHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
Line_254	THEY'RE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT AGAINST THE CITICONS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
Line_255	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
Line_256	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTANCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERRILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
Line_257	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
Line_258	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
Line_259	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITISENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE ENIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL SITIENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSERS
Line_260	INTERNAL DESCENTIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF APPRESSION EXHERTED BY THE ATHORITY OVER THE DISCINPIAN INDIVIDGUALS
Line_261	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COLD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
Line_262	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIME OF LIFE HAS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLANTARILLY SACREFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE ENTERS OF THE GROUP
Line_263	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
Line_264	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
Line_265	BUT THE FAITAL SUGNIFICENCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRODICTION INHEARANT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPEARANT IN THAT
Line_266	FOOTNOT THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABBUSES OF ATTHORITY EXIST INSPIGHT OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROUPS NOT ONLY FAILES TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
Line_267	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
Line_268	THIS INCRESE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTASCUW POINTED OUT A HUNDERDAN FIFTY YEARS AGO
Line_269	WE KNOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CAN NOT DEMINISH THEIR NUMBER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
Line_270	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERMENT THEIR OTHER GOVERMENTS EXPLODING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VILENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ONSLAVE SUBJECTS
Line_271	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
Line_272	THIS INCONSISTANCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MELTARY SERVICE
Line_273	THE POWER OF A STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST TH ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
Line_274	POOR RANDSOME ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO DEOTION AS AT THAT MOMENT
Line_275	HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS BE HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEETS
Line_276	HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSYCIPIENE FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISSAPPOINTED
Line_277	IT WAS IN THE FEMAILE LINE AS BAILES AND RANDSOME HAD RITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLURRISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROIAL HOUSES
Line_278	SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMOERATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPERTUNITY
Line_279	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER RIGHTING TO BAZER RANDSOME AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICLT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURED HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
Line_280	HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
Line_281	THE WOMAN HE HAD HITHERTWO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLOAWED IN MISSUS LEOWNES SISTER
Line_282	ALIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
Line_283	SHE HAD DIRECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULL OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
Line_284	IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANDSOME MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HER EFECTIAL SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
Line_285	RANDSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT DREMIDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
Line_286	THE STATE OF MISSUCIPY SING TO HIM THE STATE OF DISPARE SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMENENCE OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ELITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLORS IN HIS POCKET AND A NOWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
Line_287	OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THE WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COSED HER TEARS HEADAKES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACCUTIMATION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAR RANDSOMNE WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
Line_288	MISS CHARSELER HERSELF AFFERED SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE AFEOW REMARKS THEND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
Line_289	IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE SERTAIN STEPS TO CONSILIATE THE SHRINKING
Line_290	RA THIS STANDERD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
Line_291	ON RETURNSOLE I WONDERED HOW MISSUS THINDER WOULD TREET THAT BRANCH THE QUESTION
Line_292	HAD WANTS TO BY NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
Line_293	WITH HER INMENCE SYMPATHY FOR REFELLING SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTON WISHING THAT REFOLENES WERE A NITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_294	THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GRAT THE JUST REVOLATION IT WAS TRIUMPTH IT WAS SWEET EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BROUCIAL BLUDSTAINED RAVENING RACE THE LOST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
Line_295	IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW LEAGRAIC REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENCANCHISEMENT OF THOSE SEX FROM EVERY FROM OF BOUNDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
Line_296	SHE WISHED TO ACT IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PRE OCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
Line_297	HOW DID THE NADYS AN BE CONSTRAT FEAL ABOUT THE PATTET
Line_298	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIGH RAKUISE AND IT WAS NOT ROUGH MISSUS FORINDER'S SURPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PESPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRASY
Line_299	THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DO OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DONNED
Line_300	THIS MIGHT SIMON OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
Line_301	THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF LOIN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PARTS OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATHE THAN TO DY FOR IT
Line_302	SAID ALLIVE CHANSOLAR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEED FOR IRREMISTION HIS RESPONSIVILITY
Line_303	THE UNHAPPINESS OF WIMEN
Line_304	IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACREFICZE OF THIS LAST WOULD BEE REQUIRED OF HER THAT SHE SOLD A MUSTERE THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRIZE MISTVIMATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY HIS SUCCESS
Line_305	CHARLEY WAS A LONG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LASTERNICIS THAT THE CARED MUCH THE MOST
Line_306	I HAVE HATED DEAR THAT FIN AVINEOW TALKED AT ART AS IF IT WEARS SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WELL APPROFE OF WORVLEY GLORY
Line_307	WHEN MISS BERD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANS FIGURED HIS FAMILIAR HERCOMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITORY HACK SIM READY A MARSER
Line_308	AND LOOK AFTER THE DEETAILES AS WELL AS THE BUCK CURRENTS MISSUS FAOMENDER ADDED IN A TON AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SECIAL WOMEN AND WERE THE SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
Line_309	OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEAALSO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
Line_310	LIFE CHANSOLAR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND READED WARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPOLCE FOR HERSELF
Line_311	PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MO AND FOR SOME OTHERS
Line_312	THE METALS HA INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIENT A WOMAN AS MISSUS SHAMIENDER WHO LIVED AT DRAKSBERY OUHTMOT TO MIX THINGS UP
Line_313	SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMBLED HER INTO AS MANY CRECESS AS AN OLD GLAZED DESTENDED GLOVE
Line_314	IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDERAR
Line_315	THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOLDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CARELINA OR ALADAMA
Line_316	ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNEW WHATH ONE HAD COME BACK FROLL
Line_317	SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
Line_318	THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OUR LIVE SHOLD NEVER NE THROUGH ANY FARMS
Line_319	HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE ACCULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WITE HAND TO HER VISITER HER REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LEWNER'S INDISCRESSION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTENCE
Line_320	NOW I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
Line_321	I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WERE THEN TO A THIUTER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINED SO EARLY
Line_322	BESIDES I LIF DIDN'T WONT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FARM OF SAYING SO
Line_323	SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RANDSOME A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS BLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
Line_324	HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LEUWINA WITH INTELIGANT INCREDULITY
Line_325	ARE YOU VERY AMBICIOUS YOU'D LOOK AS IF YOU WEARE
Line_326	SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABONNISH IT
Line_327	MISSUS LEWNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSELER THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOTT UP FOR A SEE VOIEAGE
Line_328	HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGH OUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAIST COAT WAS ADDOORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
Line_329	SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENENT ESPECIALLY AT THE LATTER
Line_330	THOSE OF BAZELE RANDSOME WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CALACTER OF ELIVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS TETIOR IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVELE OF THE CROUD ON SOME JUDITIAL BENCH OR PELITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONS MEDDLE
Line_331	HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANSELER'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHEMERLY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXATING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
Line_332	THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE ATTERVENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LIENA
Line_333	HAVE YOU BEEN IN YURUP
Line_334	AND MISSUS LENAR ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
Line_335	AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN EMMENCE STRAT BRIM
Line_336	INSPIGHT OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FIN HEARD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
Line_337	AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRED TO WREATH WITH THE SENCIES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREETED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONTINENCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GILTY OF ELIGIANCE AND INTERPULATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS THIS CAUSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICON IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEAMING EXPOUNDE OF THE COTTINFIELD
Line_338	THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTRESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS THEY CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APPARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAJHES
Line_339	WELL SO IT IS THE ARE OLD WITCHES AND WISERDS MEDIAMS AND SPIRET DRAPPERS AND ROARING RADICLES

Line_678	CERTAINLY MY BOY BOUOMED OUT THE CAPTON HIS BLUE EYES ABROUPTLY KEAN AND PENETRATING
Line_679	GUESS MISTER FINNY WENT TO HIS CORTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
Line_680	THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THI DO
Line_681	THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR CORTERS FIRST
Line_682	WE'VE ALSER IN FRESH STAWLS TO TACK HONE THERE
Line_683	AND PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASSHION AT CRISS STANDING BEFORE HIM
Line_684	CAPTAIN BLISERDS ROUND PINK FACE CREACED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
Line_685	THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
Line_686	IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD BUT HE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO LOOK HIT MY EYES UP AN
Line_687	THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
Line_688	WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
Line_689	CRISS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COOD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
Line_690	THE CAMAFLASE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HE HAD UNDERSTOOD
Line_691	WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CRISS THOUGHT TO ASK
Line_692	HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
Line_693	THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE MOTHER OR FAMILY
Line_694	NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CRISS FELT SUCH CONFIDENTS AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLISERD
Line_695	THIS SHIP ITS CARGO IN ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
Line_696	A LIVIED YELLOW STAINED THE HARISEN BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GLAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
Line_697	THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
Line_698	HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WIKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF HAD
Line_699	THINK IT REALLY MEANS IT HE PERSUED
Line_700	NO ONE NEEDES A JOT BAN THAT'S JAKEY HERS
Line_701	HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOME HOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CRISS INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
Line_702	SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING
Line_703	CRISS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING ABLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHERCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
Line_704	AH SHOKS
Line_705	ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING AND HIM HIMPINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
Line_706	MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED WHAT WANTS WANT OF TRIUMPTH BUT UMPERIS WAS ONLY PARCIALLY ENCOURAGED
Line_707	AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
Line_708	CRISS LOOKED FROM A NICKLE PLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARA JACK AND SPARK PLUG
Line_709	MIKE BECAME UN EASY AND FISHED A NOLESTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMSTREET
Line_710	ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME YOURSELF
Line_711	WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
Line_712	AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHERCH LAINE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE EL SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER'S BOTH HOUSES AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
Line_713	THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL WHEN CRISS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JAB
Line_714	A SUDDEN CAR HOER AND WELCOME FROM THIS DREAM
Line_715	MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE COURDER
Line_716	HOW THEN DID HE TO LIVE AND WHAT DID HE OF HER SELL

Line_719	O KAY HE SAID
Line_720	BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CRISS SAFE AT HOME IN BEAD AND SAILED IMAGINARY VOYIAGES IN THE MIRRABELL
Line_721	CRISS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WAIT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED THE WITDLE
Line_722	NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK GOT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATERSTREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND MISS KCOHNSON AFPFIVIEW HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOLK SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
Line_723	AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S ER

Line_734	WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEAGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STAND POINT ASKED THE CURNAL
Line_735	NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD HIM SCRAP IN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
Line_736	RATHER A HIGPATHETICAL QUESTION CURNAL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
Line_737	I AM WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
Line_738	PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED CURNAL ASHLY
Line_739	AND DONEBONE'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
Line_740	YOURE ON THE DARSEE CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
Line_741	YOU'RE NOT AS SCRIMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMANS
Line_742	YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUFF EDGES ON IT
Line_743	ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
Line_744	PINKES AND DINEVEN HAVEN'T THEY CARL YUP
Line_745	BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT CURNAL BEMAT CAT
Line_746	I HAPPEN TO SEE THOSE CANDELESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGLE FUTTS SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
Line_747	LOOK HERE CURNAL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
Line_748	THE OLD BAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
Line_749	MAY BE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO ONED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREN LENGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
Line_750	GA EXPLAIMED THE CARNAL
Line_751	IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENTES LIKE
Line_752	NO ALIMONEY REPLIED THE CURNAL PUSLED YES JUST THAT
Line_753	SHANGDE FRET WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
Line_754	AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HIT HOPED TO SALVE SOME OF THE PROBLIMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARSEY CASE CURNAL ASHLY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEAD QUOARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
Line_755	NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
Line_756	AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFEAIRS HAD TAKEN
Line_757	THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE CURNAL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
Line_758	AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
Line_759	SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH
Line_760	CARTL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS SEGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
Line_761	IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I AND MY FISH
Line_762	BEFORE THE BIG WIND AND IRLAND SUGGESTED THOUWNG WITH THE NOD OF HIS IRISH COMPATRIET SLITELY WELL HAVE THE CURNAL
Line_763	I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTON THANKS LAPED KENNATH
Line_764	I WANT TO TALK OVER DARSEYE'S CASE WITH YOU THE CURNAL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
Line_765	SOME ONE OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
Line_766	IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS ABIT
Line_767	ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE CURNAL
Line_768	ALL RIGHT BE THERE IN A SECOND
Line_769	I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOUT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
Line_770	BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDELSTICK WONT OF A PAIR
Line_771	GET READY SHAG HE HAS A CURNAL
Line_772	BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
Line_773	IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY KATCH SOMETHING
Line_774	DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
Line_775	AND THE DETECTIVES PROFETIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLYNESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
Line_776	AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
Line_777	SORE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
Line_778	TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BY A LAMP
Line_779	BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
Line_780	AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVBOBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TUTCH HIS BEAR FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TUTCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LED PENCIL
Line_781	WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
Line_782	HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALLIE'S BODY WITH A HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDELSTICK NEAR IT
Line_783	SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUH I HAD NO SUCH SCREAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSL FEE
Line_784	AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
Line_785	BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMARCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
Line_786	IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCLAR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNATH EXPLAINED TO THE CURNAL
Line_787	I SAID I WAS GULFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
Line_788	AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARGE HOTELL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SEEN OF MANY FESTIFICATIONS
Line_789	THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONEY INQUIRED KENNIF
Line_790	IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOONCKEEPER
Line_791	NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SU HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY AL RIGHT
Line_792	CHUCKLED THE CURNAL AS HE SCILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
Line_793	IT WAS HIDE LARCH
Line_794	I WENT OVER THEM HEAR THE DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
Line_795	THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPEN TO BE SO NOW
Line_796	MEANWHILE CURNAL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BISY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARSEY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEEDINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
Line_797	THE CURNAL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
Line_798	LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT APPOSE THE SEPARATION
Line_799	SO KING GOT BAILE WHO PUT IT UP
Line_800	NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
Line_801	BUT HIS A PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOWS TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
Line_802	WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
Line_803	IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBANDS PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BACER SORT
Line_804	AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
Line_805	BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
Line_806	THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARSEY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JULEAR WAS TRIED
Line_807	I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
Line_808	I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE COULTURED TONES HE KNOW SO WELL HOW TO YUSE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE YUSE OF LATE
Line_809	I'M AFRAID MY DAD JEFSEN ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT HAS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
Line_810	SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DETS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
Line_811	TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
Line_812	LARGE HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
Line_813	BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
Line_814	NOW HEARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED CURNAL ASHLY
Line_815	ERIN GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTED GREY CONFIRMED
Line_816	AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIPP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREAEL CURNAL ASHLY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
Line_817	WHY PILLONEIAS SOME ONE ASK
Line_818	DON'T WOURRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
Line_819	THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JORE
Line_820	NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STOR ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
Line_821	STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
Line_822	GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM IN POLITITIONS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFAY
Line_823	THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARGE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECCOWS OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREET HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CROUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEETH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUIT
Line_824	IT'S IT'S AN ODD COINE AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARSY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION CEPT IN THE JUOLRY STOOR SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
Line_825	THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
Line_826	I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT I WILL TAKE TIME
Line_827	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARGE STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL OBUSE DO YOU ASKED THE CURNAL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
Line_828	AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT SYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED
Line_829	IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LOIER THAT THE HOTELL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
Line_830	THANK YOU NO
Line_831	ONLY THAT I DARSHE HESITATED AND GROW RED
Line_832	IT'S HARD FOR MISS MAISON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
Line_833	SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
Line_834	THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HERRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOCXSICATED
Line_835	HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TODAY
Line_836	HE REMEMBERED THAT SYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
Line_837	GOOD EVENING CURNAL HE CALLED GENIALLY WHLL YOU JOINED ME IN A WELSH RABT
Line_838	THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOUGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISSENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WATERED UP CURRANCY IN HIS POCKET
Line_839	THEY TOOK HERRY AWAY WHILE AGO
Line_840	IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
Line_841	FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BORE TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
Line_842	TIME WERE AT ONCE A WEAK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
Line_843	IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMAR IN TOWN BUT SIDNY OFTEN CALLED TIL HIS VECATION CAME AND A VELUMINOUS CORISPONDANCE WITH PALLY BEGILED THE LONG DAYS
Line_844	BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORYS MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY VERIEDE
Line_845	IT WAS HER TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIENT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENSE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF PALLY'S LOIEALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVOLATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOSTE OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECT OF VIRUS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COORNESS AS THE YOUNG MAN DISCUSSED THE FORTONS OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
Line_846	I HOPE MARISLA BAILY IS ALL HE THINKS SOR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
Line_847	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TUNE WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BREAD IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEETED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HELPHY HARTY SOCIAL INFLOUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
Line_848	POOERE PARLEY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
Line_849	IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR INSPIGHT OF MANY FAILORS AND DISCORAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SEENS THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER CIDNY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSEFRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THA CHANGE OF FORTUN MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
Line_850	IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
Line_851	FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUISY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SOURTS OF IMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
Line_852	CRIED PALLIE WITH THE HEARTYEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
Line_853	PITTY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMASFEAR BEHIND THUT THE YOUNG FOLKES DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR ICE WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
Line_854	FOR NEAD WAS SO OBSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE ECKNOWLED THE WHOLE BAILY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
Line_855	NOW I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WETHER MAKES ME CHEST A TWAVER BLUE
Line_856	PALLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WANDERED EAT MOST
Line_857	THANK HEVEN FOR THAT
Line_858	ONCE OR TWICE BUT SOURGHT OF CHOKING LYE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLOUTATION
Line_859	IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
Line_860	I TRY NOT TO DECEIEVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
Line_861	SHE CEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SUN ALONE THAN TO EXCERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHOARS
Line_862	SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TE JUST INQUIER AFTER HIS HEART IN A CHANNEL AWAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
Line_863	BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOME HOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF A SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
Line_864	NONE BET NEEDED HER TULLHAIRE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPOLSCE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SILFARCUSHION LIKE A FULISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
Line_865	FORGIVE ME PALLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
Line_866	SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEDFUL ALL AT ONCE
Line_867	PARLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVERITH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNY THAT UNCLE HAD WEILLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
Line_868	HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
Line_869	WHEN SATURDAY CAME PARLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR VISIT TO BACKE AND BES BUT COULDN'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCIL FOR FEN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
Line_870	TLHET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
Line_871	THIS HAD AN AN ESPECIAL CHARME TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
Line_872	HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT CITY TETTLERS SAY
Line_873	I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
Line_874	HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHENTLERMAN MADE NO FUSS
Line_875	HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLOUENCE OVER HER
Line_876	I'M OUT YOU KNOW AN PREFERED TO BE AN INDIPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
Line_877	AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COOLD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEACIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
Line_878	BUT PALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
Line_879	TAKE HOLD OF MASSAY CHARLEYE'S HEND MISS MAMY AND WALK PRITTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSEY SAID THE MADE
Line_880	I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
Line_881	THE MORE PROPOSED WAS THE MORE CREDIT
Line_882	PERHAPS SHE CHILLED HIM
Line_883	DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
Line_884	WOARLKING TO AND FRO AS YOUSUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
Line_885	SHE PULTD HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HERSGOD BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATTER UNDER HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
Line_886	THANK YOU NOW
Line_887	AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK IED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLE HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SORENDRAINE
Line_888	UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAIED UPON THE SHELF
Line_889	HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROWD AND GENEROUS WRISTOFFE TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS FELL AS HIS OWN
Line_890	MNNY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED YOU WAS A PITHIEN SO SHE COULD PATTLE IN THE PATTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RABARS
Line_891	THAT IS TO WLAY AKED TO THE WRARSE ANSWERED POLLY
Line_892	HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO PALLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BRETH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TITCY HAD NOT THE HARD TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
Line_893	NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED PALLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
Line_894	I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR OUGHT AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
Line_895	TRULY TROULY FAN
Line_896	SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRINKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
Line_897	THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INTOUSITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMTATION WHICH CAME IN A GIZE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPISE OF THE OLD EAVE IN HER COMPOSITION
Line_898	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST IMPERAPSE THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD SHRED HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED ITTEN SILENCE
Line_899	JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
Line_900	SHE RILLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
Line_901	WHAT A SPIGHTFUL THING I AM
Line_902	SO WHEN YOU MADE HER LAST POENT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING YOUR FACE KEANLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WHILE I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUISINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOY IT
Line_903	I'VE TRIED IT UND LIKED IT AND MABY THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
Line_904	ASKED THE AUTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
Line_905	WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
Line_906	PATLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIND IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
Line_907	A FULISH LITTLE SPEACH TO MAKE TO A DARK BUT YOU SEE PALLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYINETO DO HER DUTY
Line_908	NOW AS PALLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DATCHING REFORM HAD SUBCIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESSANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVER OF ROMANS INTO HER DONE HEART WORKING DAYS
Line_909	I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS LOVE ACCOMPLISH MEN'S OPPOSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSESSED A GREATER INFLOUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
Line_910	BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRISE TO MENT HER THOUGHTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
Line_911	IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEAN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
Line_912	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COCETT IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPONT AND STRAIT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WIDE LIKE LEVELLY
Line_913	LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS PARLEY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
Line_914	THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG OFF
Line_915	FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIMINISTER WITH A SHOUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OVE
Line_916	UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISS CONCEPTION AS THE PLATTER BAFP'S GILT
Line_917	CANT YOU GET A STRIKE PERMENT ASK THE ORGONIZER
Line_918	I HAD LONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BY ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELAD WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
Line_919	THE GERY FIND THE PRISONER GILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBEART HAUL
Line_920	THE GERY WISHED TO ADD A RIGTER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ALECTION ISPENDING IN THE PARLIMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMASSIS ON HAND
Line_921	OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
Line_922	A TELEGRAMAS BROUGHT IN
Line_923	THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING OINDIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY ME ESCIIONS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
Line_924	WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
Line_925	IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMITY ROOMS AT NEMASSIS

Line_1824	THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
Line_1825	BUT SURELY SAID MARGRET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
Line_1826	MARGRET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
Line_1827	WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOLD YOU SAY IT ABOUT IT
Line_1828	SHE WAS LATE FOR TEE AT HOME

Line_1835	BETTY DO YOU WISH TO DYE
Line_1836	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
Line_1837	THE MOTHER OF HOME HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGERET
Line_1838	I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGRET
Line_1839	JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLOODE A LITTLE ANNOYENCE
Line_1840	AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRN NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
Line_1841	REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
Line_1842	PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
Line_1843	SHE AND DICKSON HELD MISTERIOUS CONSOLTATIONS IN THE BEDROOM FROM WHICH DICKSON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AN CROSS AS WAS HER COUSTOME WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UP ON HER SYMPATHY
Line_1844	SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH CAREFUL ECANOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
Line_1845	CAN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
Line_1846	MARGUERET SAID MISTER HAIL AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESS DOWN STARS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY

Line_1852	HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
Line_1853	VISITING REGISTER OFFICERS SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGRET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Line_1854	BUT GOOD NIGHT CHAIRLD
Line_1855	WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MACANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRAID AND MAKING MONEY
Line_1856	SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HAL
Line_1857	THE SHARPNESS IN HER I TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGRET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
Line_1858	ONCE MARGRET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DICKSON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER NEES AND AS MARGRET STULL OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PREAIR FOR STRENGTH AND PACIEANCE TO ENDURE SEVIEAR BODILY SUFFERING
Line_1859	WELL BITSY HOW AL YOU
Line_1860	NO ONE CAME FOWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
Line_1861	MARGRET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
Line_1862	MARGRET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOOSOM
Line_1863	ALL HIS FORMAL FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSIERS THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DIS HONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WELTH
Line_1864	I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
Line_1865	AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THOURNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
Line_1866	EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
Line_1867	IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
Line_1868	YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK ANT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF IHAD LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON

Line_1875	THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
Line_1876	MARGRET BENT OVER AND SAID BETSY DON'T BE IN PACIANT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN

Line_2360	WE KNOW WHAT THE PESENTSWULL SAY AREN'T A WORKING MAN LIKE OURSELVES
Line_2361	FOLLOWED HIM LENEN LISTENED TO A NOW WITH ABSEARBING INTENCITY
Line_2362	THE JUMES AND THEM STOVES WERE DROPED
Line_2363	ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YOUNGKERS
Line_2364	IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BERCH TREE
Line_2365	ON THE THIRD DAY SAID DELAD WANTED TO SET OUT

Line_2371	AND THUS THEY JERNEYED ON WARDS A LONG LONG WAY
Line_2372	NOW THEN SAID THE FULL DOEST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2373	THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND SINDERLADS SET OUT ON HIS WAY
Line_2374	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOUL AGAIN ASK DOLST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2375	THEN THE KING PROMISSED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISCED HIS BROTHER
Line_2376	HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
Line_2377	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDERLAD
Line_2378	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOLS RUN WERE THEY CHOSE AND SEETED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE WROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
Line_2379	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDOLAD
Line_2380	THE YOUTHE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
Line_2381	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDERLAD
Line_2382	WHEN HE HAD RUNNE AFTER THE FOLDS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
Line_2383	YES THAT I HAM SAID THE USE

Line_2388	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOOL SAID DOUST THOU SEE ANYTHING
Line_2389	THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
Line_2390	BUT SIGERD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
Line_2391	THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED ATER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWORF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
Line_2392	SO YE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE OURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
Line_2393	ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWORP WAR AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
Line_2394	SO SIGOUD PUT THE HEART OF FAFINER ON A STAKE AND ROSTED IT
Line_2395	GAY THOU FAFONER AND THEN STAFONER DIED
Line_2396	FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DEARED FACE IT
Line_2397	THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BURIENHIL SLEAPES
Line_2398	ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE KNOURTH WHO HAD ONE MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
Line_2399	THEN SIGERD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REAGEN
Line_2400	THEN SIGERD ROAD AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
Line_2401	SIGERD SAID I WOULD TUTCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DYE
Line_2402	THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGAN HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
Line_2403	THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
Line_2404	THERE IS CIGERD ROSTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
Line_2405	BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SERCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
Line_2406	WENBERNHELL'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHERTHEY ROAD AND GUNNER SHET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
Line_2407	NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
Line_2408	THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOAUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
Line_2409	BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
Line_2410	FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURNHELDEN GUNDRIN WERE BAVHING BURNHELD WAITED FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRIN SUPERIOR
Line_2411	SO REGN MADE A SORD AND SIGER TRIED IT WITH A BLOW AND A LUMP OF IRN AND THE SORD BROKE
Line_2412	SO SIGER SAID THAT SORD WOULD DO
Line_2413	THEN SIGER ROADE BACK AND MET REGEN AND REGEN ASKED HIM TO ROSE FAFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
Line_2414	HE IS NO BIGER THAN OTHER JRAGON SAID THE TUTER AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
Line_2415	THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TIL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWARE THE VOW FEARLESS OF BRAKING
Line_2416	AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW T HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FEATTERS AND COOD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
Line_2417	THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE CLOOD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALLIS
Line_2418	CISS ME GAULA SAID THE HEAD
Line_2419	THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DONED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
Line_2420	ON THE FIRST THIRSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITION OF THE PALIS AND BEGGED THE KITION MAIDE WHO SLEPT THERE TO LUNT HER A BRUSH
Line_2421	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
Line_2422	THERE WAS ONCE A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
Line_2423	I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
Line_2424	WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
Line_2425	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FAIRED WORSE AND WORSE
Line_2426	SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOL DROPPED FROM IT
Line_2427	AT LAST THEY CAME INSIDE OF LAND
Line_2428	OUT ON THE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KINGS THIDE ON SAND AN STONES MY BEAD I MAKE AND MY BROTHER'S SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITTYED AND UNWEAPTD
Line_2429	NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HITIOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
Line_2430	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEE
Line_2431	THE SHAPE OF THE DISSHES VERRIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DITSHES ON STEMBS
Line_2432	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCKUMB THAT HAS RISEN
Line_2433	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISSHES
Line_2434	BOILE THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SCIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR YOUSE
Line_2435	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POARS OUT LIKE OIL
Line_2436	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTYED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN ERTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ASCED OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
Line_2437	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
Line_2438	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORENGE AND LIMENSHIOPS ARE PRESERVED
Line_2439	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SHOUOGER FIFTEEN OW THREE
Line_2440	BEFORE SHOOGER WAS IN USE HUNNEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PESERVE MANY VEGITABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUSE OF THE SHOOGER CAN
Line_2441	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONCIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
Line_2442	ISES
Line_2443	AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARSLY DO BE DISPENCED WITH
Line_2444	MARMALEIDES AND JEMS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTANCY MADE BY BOILING THE POLP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINES WITH SHOOGER
Line_2445	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SERAP AND APPLIE TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SERP WILL ON SEPARATING BE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BRAKES THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
Line_2446	FRUIT GATHERED IN WEAT OR FAWGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILLDUED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
Line_2447	THE THOUSAND AND WORN ORNIMENTAL DISSHES THAT ADDOORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PERCHIECED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THAT CAN NOT PROFERABLY BE MADE AT HOME
Line_2448	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SHOUOGER IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SHOUGER IS USED IN CONCIDERABLE QUALITIES THIS SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
Line_2449	THE SPATTEL IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER CEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
Line_2450	MARMALADES GAMS AND FRUIT PAST S ER OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
Line_2451	IT SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PREVOKE INDISPOSITION
Line_2452	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARYIT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VERIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VERIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ICE AND JUSES WHICH ONE BOILED WITH SHOGER WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN FARMASSY AS WELL AS FOR SWEET MEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATENWARD CONFIRSAY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOUD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CRISIENE
Line_2453	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN OW EIGHT
Line_2454	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A CEEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POUTERED SHOGER BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY RETURNED
Line_2455	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FURST BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
Line_2456	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
Line_2457	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGIES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
Line_2458	YES SAW SHE SORLY WAS PLUMB SCARED
Line_2459	ANY WAY HE WOULD FIND DOUBT
Line_2460	ONE DAY THIS KNO COUNT TRIFELING CUSEN OF GRAN POPP BUSERD GET COLD AT HIS FEET
Line_2461	SO WEUNSSTEAD ON THE CHIMNY TOPS WHENEVER OLD JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
Line_2462	THEY LIKED TO CHOKE THAT NO CONBUSER TO DEATH
Line_2463	WHEN HE GET HOME HE TR AND TRY TO BUSH THE SOOT OFF BUT IT DON'T GET INTO THE SKIN AND IF STAY THERE
Line_2464	WHY HE JUST STRETCH HIS FOOLL HAD AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AND LISTEN AND LISTEN
Line_2465	OLD MISTER BUSERD GRIND
Line_2466	NOW OLLE MISTER BUSERD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMIDATING AND WHEN PEATER BAGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
Line_2467	IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROGS
Line_2468	HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUSERD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
Line_2469	WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANPOPP BUSERD HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DUNE FLYES SO HIGH HE SCORCHED THE FETHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRAMPOPP BUSERD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JUST NATURALLY LAZY AND NOW COUCH
Line_2470	EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PEATER AND LAUGHED
Line_2471	WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFULING MEMBER OF THE BUSERD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AN MEDDLE IN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PEATR RABIT CAN AND ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HE HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
Line_2472	LIKE MOST KNOCOUND PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR KNOCENCE OF HIS SELF POKING HIS KNOWS INTO EVERY BODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
Line_2473	PLEASE MISTER BOUSERED PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BAGGED
Line_2474	BUCH HE DON'T MIND THAT
Line_2475	WO YOU ALL PLEASE SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER HE HOLLERD DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT
Line_2476	IT WAS ON THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE A LITTLE OLD TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE
Line_2477	THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
Line_2478	A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
Line_2479	MARGAORIET TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THROUGH HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFULE A SLIGHTE COFF PULL UP HER HANKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
Line_2480	I FANCYED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULL NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
Line_2481	TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
Line_2482	WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUSS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROBLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
Line_2483	NEVER DOL HE GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LOOCRATIVE
Line_2484	WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARIVE
Line_2485	I IMBRACED MARGARIETE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFULED
Line_2486	ONE HAS TOO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
Line_2487	DURING THIS REMARK MARGOUIET LOOKED AT MEET ATTENTIVELY
Line_2488	I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGARIETE WITH ADMARATION
Line_2489	HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
Line_2490	MARGARIET DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I ROAT TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
Line_2491	IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
Line_2492	LOOK HERE PRUDANCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGARIETE
Line_2493	WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
Line_2494	WE STAND FIRST AND THERE SELF ESTEME LAST IN THEIR ESTEME
Line_2495	IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRAGE FROM TIME TO TIME WHERE COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
Line_2496	ON THE SLEEVE DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
Line_2497	IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW

Line_2506	YOU'RE IN THE WAY MARGARIET BUT HOW
Line_2507	WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
Line_2508	WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UN THE PENELTY OF BEING PUTTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
Line_2509	BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SESPITION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
Line_2510	HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
Line_2511	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOXS ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPENED AND MARGARIET APPEARED
Line_2512	HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VODEVIEL
Line_2513	THE MORE GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GARDED
Line_2514	THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
Line_2515	YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
Line_2516	WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAYETY
Line_2517	THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
Line_2518	HE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
Line_2519	THE BOCXSES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
Line_2520	BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO ENSPIRES THIS REDEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DROUT ALL ERTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
Line_2521	NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDEANCE THE COUNT AND MARGORIET GOT INTO THE CARRAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
Line_2522	BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LAYER SONG
Line_2523	MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXHALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EX CHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
Line_2524	WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
Line_2525	I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT ITS SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
Line_2526	DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
Line_2527	THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
Line_2528	NOW GO I CANT KEEP MY EYES OPEN
Line_2529	THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL IT SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAIZE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VAL
Line_2530	THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
Line_2531	EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VEGDULENT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSTALE OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
Line_2532	THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
Line_2533	COME DURING THE THIRD END TRACT
Line_2534	ONLY ONE REMAINED EMTY THE STAGE BOX
Line_2535	WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISCIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
Line_2536	YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
Line_2537	IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGS TO ME I SERCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE EMVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
Line_2538	THERE ARE BOLTS AT THE DOOR REACH
Line_2539	WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINSEAR IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
Line_2540	WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGARIET RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOXS AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
Line_2541	BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
Line_2542	HOW WHY
Line_2543	IN ORDER TO DESTIRB THE LABORARS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIS FOR HELP
Line_2544	WHERE AT HOME
Line_2545	YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
Line_2546	THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMONE
Line_2547	A WOMAN WHO YURNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DIMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
Line_2548	A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SFEAR HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOOM NO TIBE BOWNEDHIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
Line_2549	WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLES VISITED HIM AGAIN
Line_2550	HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT JESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSONO HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMADY BY WHOSE AIDE MANY A WONDERFUL CUR OF BLIND Y HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
Line_2551	THE THREE MOST TRUST WORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMIENTIS THE LEACH CRISCEPIS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROKLIS
Line_2552	IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPITER
Line_2553	HOW LONG HE CEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONSERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
Line_2554	THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIEAL IS RITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDAL DELUSION AND SNABS ME I CAN PROVE
Line_2555	TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTENJURING ITS CONTINUENCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MIS FORTON FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIAM OF SIGHT UN REFER TO NEW CRIATIONS OF ARCTECTURE SCOULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARED HIM
Line_2556	WHEN HERMONE ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMATIOS IN THE PALLIS THE GUESTS HAD AREADY ASSEMBLED
Line_2557	SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANK WOULD MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY OUR
Line_2558	THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALLIS THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
Line_2559	THE KING SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMONE INCREDUOUSLY
Line_2560	HE LONGED WITH ARDANT YURNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORLY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
Line_2561	THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT ARRISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
Line_2562	THE PLACE BY HEARMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHIA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSONNO
Line_2563	THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAFNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORICLE
Line_2564	HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
Line_2565	HERMAN LISTENED TO THE PARIN'S SILENCE
Line_2566	ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISSAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMES CONSIDERATION AND ALTHIA DID NOT WISH TO LOOSE HERMONE'S REGARD
Line_2567	WE WOMAN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEACHIS ENTIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALLIOWES HER INTELECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPANTS IS CERTAINLY YOUNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
Line_2568	SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORICLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DIMETOR MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MERTOLIS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
Line_2569	LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISSING FOL LEAVED ONE
Line_2570	THE RARDIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRASE ARSONO ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CANSURE OF THE SCOLPTUROUS ART ONE CRATES HERMONE'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DIMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PETISTALL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
Line_2571	THE EROIAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST ISTERLY INTEREST AND ALPHIA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
Line_2572	HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROIAL DAMES FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LISIMACOUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
Line_2573	CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISTIONED BY THE CONSPIRITURS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSONO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFETIONAL ASSOSCIATES
Line_2574	YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTON WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ALSONOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASMENT
Line_2575	BUT HERMONE WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REAVAL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY AND HONOUR OF THE SEVENTEETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCOLPTER UFRAINER
Line_2576	WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
Line_2577	HITHER TWO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOIAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROIAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRISY
Line_2578	SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELANQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
Line_2579	SOMETIMES WITH A TUTCHING INTREETY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
Line_2580	SO ARKIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THI CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
Line_2581	AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HAST THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLGIERS
Line_2582	AND Y FUEL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
Line_2583	HONOUR TO MERTALIS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAIL ASCEMBLEGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AT HIS PREAIER FOR RECOVERY
Line_2584	IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ENIOLATION HE HERMOND WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ENIOLATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
Line_2585	HE HIMSELF ON TH WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALLIS AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
Line_2586	SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOTULOS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HEARMOHNE
Line_2587	AUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
Line_2588	YET IT WAS NO ELUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
Line_2589	HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SELISITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FAT INCRECED WHEN FILIPOS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRITERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET END HEADDED BY AMIENTES THE RODIAN CRISCEPOS AND PROLAS HAD PERRISHED BY THE EXCECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
Line_2590	THEN DAFNEY RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DIMETOR IS THE WORK OF MERTOIS
Line_2591	EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATER OF THE DIMEATORE HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPITION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
Line_2592	TOMORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TRETUROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
Line_2593	HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE A TROUOTH IT'S JUST DO
Line_2594	THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMASIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
Line_2595	HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BUIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE POLLUSTR THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWATED HIM SO OBAYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
Line_2596	DAFONEE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
Line_2597	DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
Line_2598	DAFNY AGAIN PLEEDED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT FHILIPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLIMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
Line_2599	BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONCENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONSCEAL IN PAIL IT NOTHING
Line_2600	INSPIGHT OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
Line_2601	LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESHOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILOPIS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALLIS
Line_2602	EVEN DAFONIEY'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
Line_2603	WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
Line_2604	WHAT EVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
Line_2605	BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEAT HIS BERTOLIS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
Line_2606	NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALLYOW YOUR LIVES
Line_2607	I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
Line_2608	CRIED HEREIMONE IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLGER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETALED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALLIS
Line_2609	BUT HEARMONE WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
Line_2610	BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
Line_2611	THE EGIPTION OBAYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STRUINED WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERRECTED FOR THE FEASTAL PERFORMENCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAIND THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COARSING SO WIDELY THROUGH HIS VAINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UN ABLE TO DESTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATERS WHO CROUDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHIEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARINA HERMON
Line_2612	TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HEARMONE PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONNE THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
Line_2613	WAS HE TO BE LEAD TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
Line_2614	WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITES YOU
Line_2615	AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH A WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POORING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HERTOIS HEART
Line_2616	ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBED UP ALMOST TO BUIRSTING

Line_2884	AND THE MARCIAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
Line_2885	HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUSTED IT THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREET INTO THE BACKGROUND

Line_2890	BUT LEVEN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXILENT PERSONS FOR WHOME HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
Line_2891	TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE DE FRESHMAN BAR

Line_197	AND HOW ABOUT THE TOOEREABROAUD ASKED TH FAMLY DOCTOR
Line_198	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
Line_199	SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FUARIOUS
Line_200	OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCE'S COME THIS WAY
Line_201	WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH OF LOWERING IT
Line_202	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS'S
Line_203	BEG PARDON IS THE EULSKEEBRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
Line_204	AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SIENTIPHICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
Line_205	THE PRINCESS WAS DESTORACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SENT AGAINST KITTY
Line_206	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEARFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KETTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEARFUL
Line_207	HE ASKED AH IT IS
Line_208	BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PERILS
Line_209	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FAT SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
Line_210	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
Line_211	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT SHE ADDED
Line_212	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTBY
Line_213	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUVISION AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTONS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCRECED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
Line_214	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
Line_215	AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROUPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
Line_216	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPAOR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DESCENTIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
Line_217	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
Line_218	GOVERNMENT ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
Line_219	THE MEANING OF GAPPRIVIYS SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUEGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOR N FOS BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE INSLAVE TOILING MASSES
Line_220	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
Line_221	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
Line_222	EVERY INCRECE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIME OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCRECE IN THEIR ARMIES
Line_223	THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY AUGHT TO DEFEND
Line_224	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AND A PRESSER
Line_225	AND SO EVERY GOVERMENT KNEADS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGNS
Line_226	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESCENCIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN ATHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTER THERE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTEERS
Line_227	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST
Line_228	THE CHAMPIANS O THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRIED TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF ATTHORITY THAT IS OF VILENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_229	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STAT VILENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION THAT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR SENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHAT EVER KNOW
Line_230	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIALBOARD
Line_231	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AN THE DISPOSITION OF MEN OF VILENCE THE EXISTANCE OF AN ATTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VILENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VILENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CAN NOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
Line_232	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
Line_233	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SANE THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSETSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
Line_234	IN FACT THE WHOLE SGNIFICENT OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSTORINUS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
Line_235	THE RIVALRY OF THE YURAPIAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FOURSES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE
Line_236	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BACSS OF POWER
Line_237	THE GREAT EXTENTION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AIDE IN FORMING SUCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPERATIONS AND CONGRESES FOR SIENTIPIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
Line_238	THE GOVERMET THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
Line_239	WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOLD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
Line_240	THE DESPATISM OF THE GOVERMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPATISM
Line_241	AND THEREFORE THE PPRESSION OF THE OPPRESST ALWAYS GOS ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LEMEN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EX
Line_242	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME SENTORI'S AGO
Line_243	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPPACK WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
Line_244	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
Line_245	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN SEASERS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPRERS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF FAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
Line_246	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
Line_247	GOVERN ATHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VILENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VILENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOBVERMENT
Line_248	THE BACES OF ATHORITY IS BODDILY VILENCE
Line_249	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BRAKE OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
Line_250	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
Line_251	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BOTTLEY VILENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
Line_252	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WANG THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LADE ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE IT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DOMENDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFEUWS TO DO SO
Line_253	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE ATHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURER
Line_254	THEY'RE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VILENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITICONS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
Line_255	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
Line_256	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTANCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
Line_257	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
Line_258	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCOWRECT
Line_259	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL SITIEONS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSERS
Line_260	INTERNAL DESCENTIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF APPRESSION EXERTED BY THE ATHORITY OVER THE DISCNPIAN INDIVIDGUALS
Line_261	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
Line_262	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE HAS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLANTARILY SACREFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE ENTERS OF THE GROUP
Line_263	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
Line_264	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEN
Line_265	BUT THE FAITALGSUGNIFICENCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARANT IN THAT
Line_266	FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF ATTHORITY EXIST IN SPIGHT OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROUPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
Line_267	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
Line_268	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTASCEW POINTED OUT A HUNDERD N FIFTY YEARS AGO
Line_269	WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CAN NOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
Line_270	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERMENT THEIR OTHER GOVERMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VILENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ONSLAVE SUBJECTS
Line_271	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN ETEMPORARY
Line_272	THIS INCOMNSISTANCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MELTARY SERVICE
Line_273	THE POWER OF A STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
Line_274	POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO DEOTION AS AT THAT MOMENT
Line_275	HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS BARE HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEETS
Line_276	HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSICIPIENE FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISSAPPOINTED
Line_277	IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BALES AN RANDSOM HAD RITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLURRISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROIAL HOUSES
Line_278	SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
Line_279	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER RIGHTING TO BAZER RANSOME AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURED HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
Line_280	HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
Line_281	THE WOMAN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLOAWED IN MISSUS LEONE'S SISTER
Line_282	ALIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFFRAID
Line_283	SHE HAD DIRECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RUYLL OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
Line_284	IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RAND SOME MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HER EFECTIAL SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
Line_285	RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMIDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
Line_286	THE STATE OF MISSUCIPY SING TO HIM THE STATE OF DISPARE SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMENENCE OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ELITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A KNOWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
Line_287	OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THE WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS CAUSED HER TEARS HEADAKES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACCUTIMATION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAER RANDSONE WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
Line_288	MISS CHARSELE HERSELF AFFERED SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE AFEUW REMARKS THEN GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
Line_289	IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
Line_290	RAISE THIS STANDERD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
Line_291	ON RETURNSOL I WONDERED HOW MISSUS THINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH THE QUESTION
Line_292	HAD WANTS TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
Line_293	WITH HER MENCE SYMPATHY FOR REFELLING SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFOLENEUS WERE A NITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_294	THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLATION IT WAS TRIUMPTH IT WAS SWEET EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BROUCAL BLUD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LOST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
Line_295	IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW LEGRAIC REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENCANCHISEMENT OF THOSE SEX FROM EVERY FRAM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
Line_296	SHE WISHED TO ACT IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCES OF THE PEOPLE
Line_297	HOW DID THE NADYS N BE CONSTREAT FEAL ABOUT THE PATET
Line_298	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIGH RAKUISE AND IT WAS NOT ROG MISSUS FORINDER'S SURPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
Line_299	THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DONNED
Line_300	THIS MIGHT SMONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SOW
Line_301	THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF LIN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PART OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DY FOR IT
Line_302	SAID ALLIVECHANSOLAR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEED FOR IRREMITTION HIS RESPONCIVILITY
Line_303	THE UNHAPPINESS OF WHIMEN
Line_304	IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE OF THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER THAT SHE SOLD A MUSTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRIZE MISTRVIMATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
Line_305	CHARLEY WAS A LONG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLER IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LASTERNICIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
Line_306	I HAVE HATED DEAR THAT FIN AVINEW TALKED AT ART AS IF IT WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WELL APPROFE OF WORVLEY GLORY
Line_307	WHEN MISS BERD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HIS FAMILIAR HERCOMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITORY HACK SIM OREADY A MARSER
Line_308	AND LOOK AFTER THE DEETAILES AS WELL AS THE BUCK CURRENTS MISSUS FAOMONDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SECIAL WOMEN AND WERE THE SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
Line_309	OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEAR ALSO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
Line_310	ALIFE CHANSOLAR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND REOADED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPELCE FOR HERSELF
Line_311	PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MOO AND FOR SOME OTHERS
Line_312	THE MOSTIALS HAF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS SHAMIENDER WHO LIVED AT DRAKSBERY OUGHTMO TO MIX THINGS UP
Line_313	SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMBLED HER INTO AS MANY CRECIESS AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
Line_314	IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDRAR
Line_315	THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOLDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALDAMA
Line_316	ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNEW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOLL
Line_317	HE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
Line_318	THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OUR LIVE SHOLD NEVER WONE THROUGH ANY FOARMS
Line_319	HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WITE HAND TO HER VISITER HER REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LEWNER'S INDISCRESSION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
Line_320	NOW I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
Line_321	I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WERE THEN TO A THUTOR PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINED SO EARLY
Line_322	BESIDES I LIF DIDN'T WONT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FOARM OF SAYING SO
Line_323	SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RANDSOME A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS BLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
Line_324	HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LEWINA WITH INTELIGANT INCREDULITY
Line_325	ARE YOU VERY AMBICIOUS YOU'D LOOK AS IF YOU WEAR
Line_326	SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABONNISH IT
Line_327	MISSUS LEWNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSELER THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEE VOIIEAGE
Line_328	HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGH OUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
Line_329	SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY AT THE LATTER
Line_330	THOSE OF BAZELE RANDSOME WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CALACTER OF ELIVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS ETIOR IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROUD ON SOME JUDITIAL BENCH OR PELITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONS MEDDLE
Line_331	HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANSELER'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHEMERLY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXALTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
Line_332	THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE ATTERVENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
Line_333	HAVE YOU BEEN IN YURUP
Line_334	AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
Line_335	AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGLY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENCE STRAT BRIM
Line_336	IN SPIGHT OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POORE AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEARDE AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
Line_337	AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRED TO REETH WITH THE SENCIS AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREETED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONTINENCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELIGIANCE AND INTERPULATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS THIS CARSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICON IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEAMING EXPOUND OF THE COTTEINFIELD
Line_338	THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS THEY CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PACES
Line_339	WELL SO IT IS THEY'RE OLD WITCHES AND WISERDS MEDIAMS AND SPIRIT DRAPPERS AND ROARING RADICLES
Line_340	THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
Line_341	JUST AS I AM THE VISITER INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH MOTHER A WERCODAY ASSPECT
Line_342	WHAT WE WANT IS TO GO OUT OF HERE QUIET AND TALK THIS SHOW UP AND SELL THE REST OF THE TOWN

Line_679	GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS CORTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
Line_680	THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THIR DO
Line_681	THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR CORTERS FIRST
Line_682	WE'VE ALSER IN FRESH STAWLS TO TACK HOE THERE
Line_683	NED PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CRISS STANDING BEFORE HIM
Line_684	CAPTAIN BLISERDS ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN IT'S WINNING SMILE
Line_685	THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHIRLE
Line_686	IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD BE HE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO LOOK HIT MY EYES UPN
Line_687	THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
Line_688	WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
Line_689	CRISS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COOD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABEN
Line_690	THE CAMMAFLOASE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HE HAD UNDERSTOOD
Line_691	WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CRISS OUGHT TO ASK
Line_692	HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
Line_693	THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE MOTHER OR FAMILY
Line_694	NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CRISS FELT SUCH CONFIDENTS AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLISEROD
Line_695	THIS SHIP ITS CARGO IN ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
Line_696	A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HARISEN BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GLABY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
Line_697	THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
Line_698	HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WHIKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF AD
Line_699	THINK I REALLY MEANS IT HE PERSUED
Line_700	NO ONE NEEDS A JOT BAN THAT'S JAKE HERRS
Line_701	HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JAB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOME HOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CRISS INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
Line_702	SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING
Line_703	CRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHERCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKR'S HOUSE
Line_704	A SHOAKS
Line_705	ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
Line_706	MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED WHAT WANTS WONT OF TRIUMPTH BUT UMPERIS WAS ONLY PARCIALLY ENCOURAEGED
Line_707	AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
Line_708	CRISS LOOKED FROM A NICKLE PLATED FLASH LIKE TO A CARAGACK AND SPARK PLUG
Line_709	MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED A NOLESTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO EMSTREET
Line_710	ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME YOUSELF
Line_711	WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
Line_712	AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHERCH LAIN GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER'S BOTH HOUSES AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
Line_713	THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL WHAN CRISS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JAB
Line_714	A SUDDEN CAR HOWER AND WELCOM FROM THIS DREAM
Line_715	MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE COURDNER
Line_716	HOW THEN DID HE TO LIVE AND WHAT DID HE OF HER SEL
Line_717	PICTURE AN GOIN AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIN HIM
Line_718	ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY AND BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBEN
Line_719	O KAY HE SAID
Line_720	BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CRISS SAFE AT HOME IN BEAD AND SAILED THIMAGINARY VOIAGES IN THE MIRRABELL
Line_721	CRISS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WAIT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED THE WITTLE
Line_722	NO LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK GOT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND MISS KCOHNSON AFFIVIEW HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOLK SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
Line_723	AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S DER
Line_724	THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEAD QUORTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET SEEN
Line_725	FUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANY HOW HE HAD A PARKER NAMED SHERALLIE

Line_730	THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
Line_731	YES IT STILL HOLDS A GOOD
Line_732	AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T TKNOW
Line_733	AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
Line_734	WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE CURNAL
Line_735	NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD HIM SCRAP IN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
Line_736	RATHER A HIPATHETICAL QUESTION CURNAL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
Line_737	I AM WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
Line_738	PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED GCURNAL ASHLY
Line_739	AND DONBONG'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
Line_740	YOU'RE ON THE DARSE CACE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
Line_741	YOU'RE NOT AS SCRIMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
Line_742	YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
Line_743	ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
Line_744	PINKS AND DINEVEN HAVEN'T THEY CARL YOU P
Line_745	BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT CURNAL BEIMMAT CAT
Line_746	I HAPPEN TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGLE FUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
Line_747	LOOK HERE CIRNAL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
Line_748	THE OLD AGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
Line_749	MAY BE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREN LENGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
Line_750	GAETA EXPLAIMED THE CARNAL
Line_751	IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENTERS LIKE
Line_752	NO ALMONEY REPLIED THE CURNAL PUSLED YES JUST THAT
Line_753	SHANG DE FRET WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
Line_754	AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS I HOPED TO SALVE SOME OF THE PROBLIMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARSY CASE CURNAL ASHLY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEAD QUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
Line_755	NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
Line_756	AND SHAGG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
Line_757	THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE CURNAL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
Line_758	AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
Line_759	SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS SWATCH
Line_760	CART'L WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS SEGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
Line_761	IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I ABBAND MY FISH
Line_762	BEFORE THE BIG WIND AND IRELAND SUGGESTED THOAUWNG WITH NOD OF HIS IRISH COMPATRIET SLITELY E'LL HAVF THE CURNAL
Line_763	I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAPPED KENNITH
Line_764	I WANT TO TALK OVER DARSHEE'S CASE WITH YOU THE CURNAL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
Line_765	SOME ONE OUT THERE TO SEE YOU
Line_766	IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
Line_767	ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE CURNAL
Line_768	ALL RIGHT BE HERE IN A SECOND
Line_769	I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
Line_770	BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDELESTICK WONT OF A PAIR
Line_771	GET READY SHAG HE HAS A CURNAL
Line_772	BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
Line_773	IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
Line_774	DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
Line_775	AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFETIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLYNESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
Line_776	AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
Line_777	SORES HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
Line_778	TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
Line_779	BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
Line_780	AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TUTCH HIS BAR FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TUTCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LED PENCIL
Line_781	WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
Line_782	HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALLI'S BODY WITH A HEAD BUSTED IN AN THIS HEAVY CANDELSTICK NEAR IT
Line_783	SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUH I HAD NO SUCH SCREAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FETE
Line_784	AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT SUP
Line_785	BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMARCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
Line_786	IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCLER WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNATH EXPLAINED TO THE CURNAL
Line_787	I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
Line_788	AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARGE HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SEEN OF MANY FESTIFICATSIONS
Line_789	THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNEFF
Line_790	IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
Line_791	NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGEMENT OH HE'LL PAY AL RIGHT
Line_792	CHUCKLED THE CARNAL AS HE SCILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
Line_793	IT WAS HYGE LARCH
Line_794	I WENT OVER THEM HEART THE DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
Line_795	THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS TO BE SO NOW
Line_796	MEANWHILE CARNAL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BISY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARSEY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEEDINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
Line_797	THE CURNAL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
Line_798	LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
Line_799	SO KING GOT BAILE WHO PUT IT SUP
Line_800	NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
Line_801	BUT HIS A PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
Line_802	WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
Line_803	IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A ACER SORT
Line_804	AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
Line_805	BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
Line_806	THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARSEY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JULEIR WAS TRIED
Line_807	I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
Line_808	I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNOW SO WELL HOW TO YUSE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE YUSE OF LATE
Line_809	I'M AFRAID MY DAD JESEN ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT HAS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
Line_810	SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
Line_811	TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEVY
Line_812	LARGE HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
Line_813	BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
Line_814	NOW SHERRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED CURNAL ASHLY
Line_815	ERN GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTED GLE CONFIERMED
Line_816	AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREAL CURNAL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
Line_817	WHY PILLONIES SOME ONE ASK
Line_818	DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
Line_819	THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE LORE
Line_820	NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
Line_821	STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
Line_822	GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM IN POLITITIONS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAPFAY
Line_823	THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARGE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECCOWS OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUIT
Line_824	IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARSY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION CEPT IN THE JUOLRY STOOR SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
Line_825	THE STOPPER CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
Line_826	I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
Line_827	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARGE STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE CURNAL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
Line_828	AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATHFORD HAD MARRIED
Line_829	IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LOIER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
Line_830	THANK YOU NO
Line_831	ONLY THAT I DARSHE HESITATED AND GROUW RED
Line_832	IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MADJOR
Line_833	HE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
Line_834	THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HERRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
Line_835	HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
Line_836	HE REMEMBERED THAT SIYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
Line_837	GOOD EVENING CURNAL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOINED ME IN A WELSH RABT
Line_838	THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WATERED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
Line_839	THEY TOOK HERRY A WAY WHILE AGO
Line_840	IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
Line_841	FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BORE TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
Line_842	TIME WERE AT ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
Line_843	IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SIDNY OFTEN CALLED TIL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRISPONDANCE WITH PALLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
Line_844	BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORYS MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY VRIEDE
Line_845	IT WAS HER TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENSE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECT OF VERLUS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COORNESS AS THE YOUNG MAN DISCUSSED THE FORTONS OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
Line_846	I HOPE MARIA BAILY IS ALL HE THINKS SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
Line_847	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TUNE WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEETED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HELPHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLOUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
Line_848	POOR PARLEY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
Line_849	IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR INSPIGHT OF MANY FAILORS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SEENS THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER CIDNY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSEFRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUN MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
Line_850	IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
Line_851	FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUISY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEART'S
Line_852	CRIED PALLISE WITH THE HEARTY EST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
Line_853	PITTY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMASFEAR BEHIND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR ICE WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
Line_854	FOR NED WAS SO OBSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE ACKNOWLED THE WHOLE BAILY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
Line_855	NOW I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WETHER MAKES ME CHEST A TWIVER BLUE
Line_856	PALLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WANDERED EDDET MOST
Line_857	THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
Line_858	ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKING LYE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLOATATION
Line_859	IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
Line_860	I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
Line_861	SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SUN ALONE THAN TO EXCERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHEARS
Line_862	SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A CHANE AWAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
Line_863	BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOME HOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF A SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
Line_864	NONE BUT NEEDED HER TULL HAIR FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPOLSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SILFARCUSHION LIKE A FULISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
Line_865	FORGIVE ME PALLY BUT I CA'N'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
Line_866	SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
Line_867	PARLEY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVRETH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNY THAT UNCLE HAD WILLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
Line_868	HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
Line_869	WHEN SATURDAY CAME PARLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR VISIT TO BACKE AND BES BUT COULDN'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FEN THOUGH IT WAS CAWLING TIME
Line_870	LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
Line_871	THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
Line_872	HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT KITTY TETTLERS SAY
Line_873	I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
Line_874	HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHAENTLERMAN MADE NO FUSS
Line_875	HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
Line_876	I'M OUT YOU KNOW AND PREFERED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
Line_877	AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COOD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEACIANT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
Line_878	BUT PALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
Line_879	TAKE HOLD OF MASSY CHARLEY'S HEND MISS MAMMY AND WALK PRITTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAIDE
Line_880	I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
Line_881	THE MORE PROPOSED WAS THE MORE CREDYIT
Line_882	PERHAPS SHE D CHILLED HIM
Line_883	DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
Line_884	WALKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
Line_885	SHE PUT HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HERSGOD BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATTER UNDER HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
Line_886	THANK YOU NOW
Line_887	AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK VIED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLE HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SORENDRAINE
Line_888	UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
Line_889	HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROWED AND GENEROUS WRISTOFFED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS FELL AS HIS OWN
Line_890	MINNY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED YOU WAS A PITHIEN SO SHE COULD PATTLE IN THE PATTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RABRS
Line_891	THAT IS TO WRAY AKED TO THE WARSE ANSWERED POLLY
Line_892	HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO PALLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TITTY HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
Line_893	NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED PALLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE A PROPOSED
Line_894	I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR AUGHT AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
Line_895	TRULY TRULY FAIN
Line_896	SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRINKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
Line_897	THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INTOUSITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIE OF THE OLD EAVE IN HER COMPOSITION
Line_898	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST IMPERAPSE THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED ITENSILENCE
Line_899	JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
Line_900	SHERILLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
Line_901	WHAT A SPIGHTFUL THING I AM
Line_902	SO WHEN YOU MADE HER LAST POTENT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING YOUR FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WHILE I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOY IT
Line_903	I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MABLY THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
Line_904	ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
Line_905	WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
Line_906	PATLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY KOIND IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
Line_907	A FULISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DARK BUT YOU SEE PALLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYIN TO DO HER DUTY
Line_908	NOW AS PALLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DATCHING REFORM HAD SUBCIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESSANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVER OF ROMANS INTO HER DONN HEART WORKING DAYS
Line_909	I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS LOVE ACCOMPLISH MEN'S OPPOSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLOENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
Line_910	BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIS TO MENT HER THOUGHTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
Line_911	IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED BE WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
Line_912	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COCETT IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPONENT AND STRAIT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WIDE LIKE LEVELLY
Line_913	LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS PARLEY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
Line_914	THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG OFF
Line_915	FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIMMINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OV
Line_916	UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OUR MISS CONCEPTION AS THE PLATTER BAFTE'S GILT
Line_917	CANT YOU GET A STRIKE PERMET ASK THE ORGONIZER
Line_918	I HAD LONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BY ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITH HELD OR EVEN DELADD WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
Line_919	THE GERY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBART HAWL
Line_920	THE GERY WISHED TO ADD A RIGHTER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY LECTION ISPENDING IN THE PARLIMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMASSIS ON HAND
Line_921	OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
Line_922	A TEMLEGRAMAS BROUGHT IN
Line_923	THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING INDIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY ME SCCIONS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
Line_924	WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BANDS
Line_925	IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMITY ROOMS AT NEMESSIS
Line_926	OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERSISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
Line_927	HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELIGRAM RADRAS IN TO NIGHT
Line_928	THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARSORATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL

Line_1689	I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
Line_1690	I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SIRPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE METTLES OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUT DO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE GALICANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEME IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARKY KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLASSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCOLPTOR'S CRAFT
Line_1691	I BEGGED HIS MOST LUSTROUS EXCILENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
Line_1692	NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCOLPTER IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BUNE OF FINISHING MY PERSIOUS FOR THAT NOBLE PEATSA OF HIS MOST LUSTRIOUS EXCLENCY
Line_1693	WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNADONAY WHO WAS FOURSED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENEUS HE AND ANTONIA LANDEY WITH HIM
Line_1694	I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGE DECK CORTONNA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
Line_1695	I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOR TO TAKEN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
Line_1696	THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLKE THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
Line_1697	YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGIELAE
Line_1698	IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICITIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LEAPS INTO SOME ERROR
Line_1699	I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISRACE
Line_1700	AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PEO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
Line_1701	GIEORGIOE CAME FOR THEM HIS HELPH
Line_1702	A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
Line_1703	I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOR CORN THE STONE'S
Line_1704	THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MENDER'S
Line_1705	WE KNOW THE FOOT STEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRAICED
Line_1706	THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTWOARDED CANNOT BE ENIHELATED
Line_1707	MAN JUDGES HIMSELF

Line_1718	IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
Line_1719	DID HE ALOPE TIRANTS TO SHEAD THE BLOOD OF PATRIATS

Line_1727	CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVEL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
Line_1728	WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORM THEN HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIATIC THE INSANE
Line_1729	HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEATS ON LIFE
Line_1730	LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
Line_1731	CAN MECUERE DESIESE BY SUPLICATTION
Line_1732	WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HAUNGORIEE OR OUSPIA

Line_1734	THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
Line_1735	HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT THE EAVOAR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BIGHT IS DEATH
Line_1736	WE KNOW THE PARTS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
Line_1737	IT IS A RESAUNT

Line_1748	LIPS PRELITIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMPINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM

Line_1750	THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DEILIGENTLY REAT DERIN
Line_1751	FEAR BE ITS LEOLTER ENOUGH WAS THE SACREFIZKED

Line_1764	IT FOLLOWS THAT NONENTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATER
Line_1765	THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNEDUOLTORATED CURSE
Line_1766	THIS FREES WOMEN
Line_1767	IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPEORETE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONIST
Line_1768	RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT HIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PREYER THAT HIS MASTER PURNISHES AND REWOARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAZSE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
Line_1769	MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNETUROO

Line_1787	THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COODNOUT
Line_1788	COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN RISTIANITY
Line_1789	THEY LEAVE BY FROAWDS AND VILENCE AND BEQUEATHED THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
Line_1790	RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
Line_1791	POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHINLESS
Line_1792	DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EIRCE AND SWOLLOW TO THOUSAND OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN ALL THAT WITH THE VALCADOS HE HAS OVER WELLMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE

Line_1795	CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURE IT FOR EVER
Line_1796	WE MUST HAVE GORN THE STOINS
Line_1797	IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELIGENCE ANY DESINE BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
Line_1798	AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OCCON LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR IN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GUD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEAST
Line_1799	IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FEENDISH JUST AS IN FAMOUS AS THE CATALICSPIRIT
Line_1800	SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GUASTLY PALE
Line_1801	A SERVANT GIVE DICKSON PERMINAT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SERCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
Line_1802	NO MAMA THAT AUNT BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
Line_1803	HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
Line_1804	BETTY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
Line_1805	BUT WHOS COME AT LAST AND WHOS WELCOME AS LONG AS WHO WILL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS NOT ABOUT
Line_1806	I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
Line_1807	I BELIEVE WE SEE AND NO MORE
Line_1808	MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
Line_1809	BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
Line_1810	I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF LATHER IS NOT THERE
Line_1811	BUT THE GIRL ANNE PLAIDED THE MORE WITH MARGRET
Line_1812	PERSONA'LY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
Line_1813	I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
Line_1814	I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS ITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
Line_1815	ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BETTY HIGENS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
Line_1816	HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISCROACE
Line_1817	NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
Line_1818	NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACH TOO
Line_1819	PRESENTLY OF THE SPASM THAT FORE SHATDERED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BITTY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
Line_1820	THE FEVERISH COLLOUR CAME INTO A CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO A ARY
Line_1821	NOT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
Line_1822	PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
Line_1823	YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
Line_1824	THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
Line_1825	BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
Line_1826	MARGERET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
Line_1827	WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOLD YOU SAY IT ABOUT IT
Line_1828	SHE WAS LATE FOR TREE AT HOME
Line_1829	AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SCOLLED STREET BETTY SAID
Line_1830	HIS FATHER DYING IN MISORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
Line_1831	I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING THAT MARGRET'S GROWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
Line_1832	THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEAL ANON
Line_1833	I'M SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
Line_1834	BETTY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAFT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
Line_1835	BETTY DO YOU WISH TO DAH
Line_1836	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
Line_1837	THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
Line_1838	I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGREIT
Line_1839	JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYEENCE
Line_1840	AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRE NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
Line_1841	REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
Line_1842	PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLAICE
Line_1843	SHE AND DICKSON HELD MISTERIOUS CONSOLTATIONS IN THE BEDROOM FROM WHICH DICKSON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOME WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UP ON HER SYMPATHY
Line_1844	SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH CAREFUL ECOANOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
Line_1845	CAN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
Line_1846	MARGARET SAID MISTER HAL AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
Line_1847	BUT WHAT WAS IT
Line_1848	SO THEY LEFT MELTIN
Line_1849	OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDERDS OF WELPH
Line_1850	I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
Line_1851	TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF FORTUNE PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
Line_1852	HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
Line_1853	VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGRET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Line_1854	BUT GOOD NIGHT CHARLDE
Line_1855	WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MACANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRAIDI AND MAKING MONEY
Line_1856	SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE
Line_1857	THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGRET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
Line_1858	ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DICKSON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER NEES AND AS MARGARET STALL OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PREAIR FOR STRENGTH AND PACIEANCE TO ENDURE SVIEAR BODILY SUFFERING
Line_1859	WELL BITSY HOW ALLE YOU
Line_1860	NO ONE CAME FOWRADS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
Line_1861	MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
Line_1862	MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOOSEM
Line_1863	ALL HIS FORMAL FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSIERS THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
Line_1864	I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
Line_1865	AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
Line_1866	EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
Line_1867	IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
Line_1868	YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I HAD LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
Line_1869	SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LISTEN THE EVIL INFLOUBENCE OF THE MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
Line_1870	YOU WILL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPAKES A BIT GROUEFISH AT FIRST
Line_1871	I HAD FORGOT TO KNOW WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
Line_1872	IT'S SIMPLE ARE NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
Line_1873	BUT MICLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
Line_1874	I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PEACES BY COFFING OF NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIDE OF MILTON AND IN LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BULA AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
Line_1875	THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
Line_1876	MARGRET BENT OVER AND SAID BETSY DON'T BE INPACIANT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
Line_1877	THERE WAS SEVERAL OTHER SIUENS OF SOMETHING RONG ABOUT MISSUS HAIL
Line_1878	BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES IN FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLAD ON HER FORMALLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITH HELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
Line_1879	MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HAL QUIETLY
Line_1880	HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
Line_1881	DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS

Line_1906	NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES
Line_1907	THE FORMAR WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGAED COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INCINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTENDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISS CONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS
Line_1908	FIERAND FURY

Line_1954	AND PUTTING THE PEAS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBERARY
Line_1955	AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEVES MUST BE VERY PARTICUAL IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP IN AN ENTIRLYKNEW PLAN

Line_2343	ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH ACCURED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WE SHOULD REVEAL THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EGRIDIAN PROGRAM OF THE BLSHIEVIKY AND THE LIFE SOCIALIST REVOLITIONARIES
Line_2344	HE SPOKE TO THE ROUM CONVENTION
Line_2345	MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STRATOARS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMITY WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
Line_2346	BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINSCIBLE
Line_2347	WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLICIONIST A PROVOCATER THEY BELOVED AT HAIME
Line_2348	EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT BALE AND WATERY AT NOON
Line_2349	THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BRAKE WITH THE VEAL OF THE PEOPLE

Line_2357	BY DECLINING THEIR ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLAN TO PLUG THAR DREACTION OF THE EXECUTED COMMITTY
Line_2358	HAVEN'T I GOD SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVERERS
Line_2359	YOU CALL YOURSI'VES THE PEOPLE OF RUSHIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSHIA
Line_2360	WE KNOW WHAT THE PESENTSWILL SAY AREN'T A WORKING MAN LIKE OURSELVES
Line_2361	FOLLOWED HIM LENEN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSHARBING INTENCITY
Line_2362	THE FUMES AND THEM STOVES WERE DROPPED
Line_2363	ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YOUNGSKERS
Line_2364	IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
Line_2365	ON THE THIRD DAY SAID DELAD WANTED TO SET OUT
Line_2366	COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COME YOUR HAIR
Line_2367	SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE TO LIVE LONG DAG
Line_2368	AND NOW INQUIRE THE POLL SEEST THOU NOTHING KNOW
Line_2369	I AM WALKING ABOUT IN ER TO A PLACE SAID SENDER LAD
Line_2370	HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
Line_2371	AND THUS THEY RERNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
Line_2372	NOW THEN SAID THE FULL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2373	THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND SINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
Line_2374	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOLLE AGAIN ASK DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2375	THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
Line_2376	HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
Line_2377	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDERLAND
Line_2378	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOLDS RUN WERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
Line_2379	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERLAD
Line_2380	THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
Line_2381	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDERLADE
Line_2382	WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOLDS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
Line_2383	YES THAT I HAME SAID THE YUSE
Line_2384	THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOOL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
Line_2385	SCIMBORLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITTURE AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WHEAL THE SORD WITH PERFECT EASE
Line_2386	FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
Line_2387	WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOWLS ASKED THE KING
Line_2388	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOOL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
Line_2389	THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
Line_2390	BUT SIGERD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRALED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
Line_2391	THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED ATER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWORFI WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
Line_2392	SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
Line_2393	ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWORP WAR AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
Line_2394	SO SIGOUD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STAKE AND ROUSTED IT
Line_2395	AY THOU FAFONER AND THEN SAFONER DAIED
Line_2396	FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
Line_2397	THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRENHILL SLEAPES
Line_2398	ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE KNORTH WHO HAD WONE MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
Line_2399	THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REAGIN
Line_2400	THEN SIGERD ROAD AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
Line_2401	SIGNER SAID I WOULD TUTCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DY
Line_2402	THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGAN HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
Line_2403	THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
Line_2404	THERE IS CIGERD ROSTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
Line_2405	BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEAL'D
Line_2406	WENBERNHEL'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY ROAD AND GUNNER SHET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
Line_2407	NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
Line_2408	THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
Line_2409	BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
Line_2410	FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURNHELDEN GUNDRIN WERE BAVHING BURNHELD WAITED FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRAIN SUPERIOR
Line_2411	SO REGEN MADE A SORD AND SIGER TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRN AND THE SORD BROKE
Line_2412	SO SIGERT SAID THAT SORD WOULD DO
Line_2413	THEN SIGIER RODE BACK AND MET REGEN AND REGEN ASKED HIM TO ROSE FAFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
Line_2414	HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTER AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
Line_2415	THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEARE THE VOW FEARLESS OF BRAKING
Line_2416	AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAWGHT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
Line_2417	THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE LOOD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALLIS
Line_2418	CISS ME GAU SAID THE HEAD
Line_2419	THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BOWERED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DONNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
Line_2420	ON THE FIRST THIRSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITION OF THE PALIS AND BEGGED THE KITION MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LUNT HER A BROUSH
Line_2421	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
Line_2422	THERE WAS ONCE AT A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
Line_2423	I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
Line_2424	AND WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
Line_2425	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
Line_2426	SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOIL DROPPED FROM IT
Line_2427	AT LAST THEY CAME INSIDE OF LANDO
Line_2428	OUT ON THE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KINGS THIDE ON SANDON STONES MY BEAD I MAKE AND MY BROTHER'S SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITTYED AND UNWEPT
Line_2429	NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HITIOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
Line_2430	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEE
Line_2431	THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VERRIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DITCHES ON STEMBBS
Line_2432	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCHUMB THAT HAS RISEN
Line_2433	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISSHIES
Line_2434	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR OUSE
Line_2435	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON PORES OUT LIKE OIL
Line_2436	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTYED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ASCED OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
Line_2437	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSIARY
Line_2438	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LIMENSHOPS ARE PRESERVED
Line_2439	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SHOUGER FIFTEEN O THREE
Line_2440	BEFORE SHOOGER WAS IN USE HUNNEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE USE OF THE SHOOGER CAN
Line_2441	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
Line_2442	IES
Line_2443	AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARSLY TO BE DISPENSCED WITH
Line_2444	MARMALEIDES AND JEMS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SHOGER
Line_2445	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SERP WILL ON SEPARATING BE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BRAKES THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
Line_2446	FRUIT GATHERED IN WHEAT OR FAUGY WETHER WILL SOON BE MILLDUED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
Line_2447	THE THOUSAND AND WORN ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PERCHICED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THAT CAN NOT PROFEABLY BE MADE AT HOME
Line_2448	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SHOUOGER IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SHOUOGER IS USED IN CONCIDERABLE QUALITIES THIS SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
Line_2449	THE SPATTEL IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER CEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
Line_2450	MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTS ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
Line_2451	IT SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
Line_2452	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VERIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VERIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS UCE AND JUSES WHICH ONE BOILED WITH SHOGER WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN FARMASSY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATENWARD CONFIRSAY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOUD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CRISIENE
Line_2453	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
Line_2454	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A CEAEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POUTED SHOGER BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY RETURNED
Line_2455	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FURS BY SERP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
Line_2456	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
Line_2457	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERT'S
Line_2458	YES SAW SHE SORELY IT WAS PLUMB SCAIRED
Line_2459	ANY WAY HE WOULD FIND OUT
Line_2460	ONE DAY THIS KNO COUNT TRIFLING COUSEN OF GRAN POP BUSERD GET COLD AT HIS FEET
Line_2461	SO WE UNS STEAD ON THE CHIMNEY TOPS WHENEVER OLD JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
Line_2462	THEY LIKED TO CHOKE THAT NO CONBURSER TO DEATH
Line_2463	WHEN HE GET HOME HE TRY AND TRY TO BUSH THE SOOT OFF BUT IT DON'T GET INTO THE SKIN AND IF STAY THERE
Line_2464	WHY HE JUST STRETCH HIS FOLL HAD AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AND LISTEN AND LISTEN
Line_2465	OLD MISTER BUSER GRIND
Line_2466	NOW OLLE MISTER BUSERD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMIDATING AND WHEN PETER BAGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
Line_2467	IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHERS FROGS
Line_2468	HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUSER VERY CURIOUS INDEED
Line_2469	WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANPOPP BUSERD HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DUNE FLYES SO HIGH HE SCORCHED THE FETHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRAMPOPP BUSERD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JUST NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUCH
Line_2470	EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PETER AND LAUGHED
Line_2471	WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE BUSERD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AN MEDDLE IN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABIET CAN AND ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HE HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
Line_2472	LIKE MOST NO COUNT PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NOCENCE OF HIS SELF POKING HIS KNOWS INTO EVERY BODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
Line_2473	PLEASE MISTER BOUSERD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BAGGED
Line_2474	BUCH HE DON'T MIND THAT
Line_2475	WOH YOU ALL PLEASE SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER HE HOLLERED DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT
Line_2476	IT WAS ON THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE A LITTLE OLD TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE
Line_2477	THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER'S STORY
Line_2478	A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
Line_2479	MARGARIET TIRED OUT WITH HIS LONG CONFESSION THROUGH HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHTE COFF PULL UP HER HANKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
Line_2480	I FANCYED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
Line_2481	TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
Line_2482	WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROB'LY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
Line_2483	NEVER DOES HE GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LEOCRATIVE
Line_2484	WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE LARIVE
Line_2485	I IMBRACED MARGARET UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFULED
Line_2486	ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
Line_2487	DURING THIS REMARK MARGOUIETE LOOKED AT MEET ATTENTIVELY
Line_2488	I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGARIETE WITH ADMAIRATION
Line_2489	HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
Line_2490	MARGRIET DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I ROAT TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
Line_2491	IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
Line_2492	LOOK HERE PRUDEANCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGARIETE
Line_2493	WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
Line_2494	WE STAND FIRST AND THERE SELF ESTEME LAST IN THEIR ESTEME
Line_2495	IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME WHERE COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATURE
Line_2496	ON THE SLEEVE DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
Line_2497	IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
Line_2498	I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME

Line_2503	I FELT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
Line_2504	I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
Line_2505	SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTEXS NOR CONSOLS
Line_2506	YOU'RE IN THE WAY MARGARET BUT HOW
Line_2507	WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
Line_2508	WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UND THE PENALTY OF BEING HUTTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
Line_2509	BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPITION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
Line_2510	HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
Line_2511	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPENED AND MARGARIET APPEARED
Line_2512	HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VOUDEVIEL
Line_2513	THE MORE GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
Line_2514	THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKEN
Line_2515	YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WYAT
Line_2516	WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAYETY
Line_2517	THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
Line_2518	HE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
Line_2519	THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
Line_2520	BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO ENSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DROUBT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
Line_2521	NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGORIET GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
Line_2522	BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LATER SONG
Line_2523	MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXHEALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
Line_2524	WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
Line_2525	I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT'S SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
Line_2526	DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
Line_2527	THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOFS TO GIVE
Line_2528	NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
Line_2529	THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAZE A CORNER OF THE MISTERY VALE
Line_2530	THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOAVES HIM
Line_2531	EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VEGDULENT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSTAL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
Line_2532	THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUS LY
Line_2533	COME DRING THE THIRD END TRACTS
Line_2534	ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY THE STAGE BOX
Line_2535	WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
Line_2536	YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
Line_2537	IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGS TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE EMNVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
Line_2538	THERE ARE BOLTS AT THE DOOR WREACH
Line_2539	WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SNSEAR IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
Line_2540	WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGARIETE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOXS AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
Line_2541	BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
Line_2542	HOW W'Y
Line_2543	IN ORDER TO DESTIRB THE LABORERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
Line_2544	WERE AT HOME
Line_2545	YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
Line_2546	THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMOHINE
Line_2547	A WOMAN WHO YURNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
Line_2548	A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SFEAR HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIME BOWNEDHIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
Line_2549	WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCELES VISITED HIM AGAIN
Line_2550	HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSONO HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMADY BY WHOSE AIDE MANY A WONDERFUL CUR OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN ROADS
Line_2551	THE THREE MOST TRUST WORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMIENTIS THE LEAH CRISCEPIS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROKLIS
Line_2552	IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPRITER
Line_2553	HOW LONG HE CEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONSERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHTS
Line_2554	THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS RITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDEAL DELUSION AND SNABS ME I CAN PROVE
Line_2555	TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTENJURING ITS CONTINUENCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MIS FORTUON FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIAM OF SIGHT UN REFER TO NEW CRIATIONS OF ARCTECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEARED HIM
Line_2556	WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMATIS IN THE PALLIS THE GUESTS HAD AREADY ASSEMBLED
Line_2557	SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANK WORLD MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
Line_2558	THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALLIS THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
Line_2559	THE KING SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
Line_2560	HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YURNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SOURLY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
Line_2561	THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT ARRISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
Line_2562	THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ELTHIA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSONO
Line_2563	THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAFFNEY AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORCLE
Line_2564	HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CRATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
Line_2565	HERMAN LISTENED TO THE PARIAN'S SILENCE
Line_2566	ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMES CONSIDERATION AND ALTHIA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMONE'S REGARD
Line_2567	WE WOMAN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEACH IS ENTIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ARTS WHICH GAVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALLOWES HER INTELECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPANTS IS CERTAINLY YOUNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
Line_2568	SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORICLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETOR MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MERTOLIS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
Line_2569	LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISSING FOL LEAVED ONE
Line_2570	THE RARDIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSONO ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CANSURE OF THE SCOLPTUROUS ART ONE CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PETISTALL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATU
Line_2571	THE AROIAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALPHIA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
Line_2572	HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROIAL DAMES FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LISIMACIUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
Line_2573	CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRITURS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFETIONAL ASSOCIATES
Line_2574	YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ALRLSONOW IN MANY AN EMBARRASMENT
Line_2575	BUT HERMIONE WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REAVAL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY AND HONOUR OF THE SEVENTEETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCOLPTER UFRANER
Line_2576	WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
Line_2577	HITHER TWO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROIAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRAISY
Line_2578	SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
Line_2579	SOMETIMES WITH TUTCHING INTREETY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
Line_2580	SO BARKIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
Line_2581	AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDERS
Line_2582	AND MY FUL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
Line_2583	HONOUR TO MERTALIS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAIL ASCEMBLEGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND ATE HIS PREIER FOR RECOVERY
Line_2584	IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ENIOLATION HE HERMOON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ENIOLATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
Line_2585	HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALLIES AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
Line_2586	SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOULIS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HEAREMOHNE
Line_2587	AUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTAOLS
Line_2588	YET IT WAS NO ELUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
Line_2589	HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SELISITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FAIT INCRECED WHEN FILIPOS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRITERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET END HEADED BY AMINTES THE RODIAN CRISCEPOS AND PROQLAS HAD PERRISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISES
Line_2590	THEN DAFNY RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DMETOR IS THE WORK OF MERTOIS
Line_2591	EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DIMETORE HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPITION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
Line_2592	TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TORETUROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
Line_2593	HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH IT'S JUST DOO
Line_2594	THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMSIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
Line_2595	HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE POLLUSTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBAYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
Line_2596	DAFFNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
Line_2597	DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
Line_2598	DAFNY AGAIN PLEEDED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT FHILIPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLIMATION THE ORDEAR OF THE KING
Line_2599	BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSCENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL IN PAIL IT NOTHING
Line_2600	IN SPIGHT OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRAPTITUDE
Line_2601	LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PILOPIS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALLIS
Line_2602	EVEN DAFONIEY'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
Line_2603	WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS HEART
Line_2604	WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
Line_2605	BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BERTOLIS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
Line_2606	NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALLWOW YOUR LIVES
Line_2607	I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
Line_2608	CRIED HERMOHNE IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLGER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETALED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALLIS
Line_2609	BUT HEARMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
Line_2610	BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
Line_2611	THE EGIPTION OBAYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STRUINED WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMENCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAIN THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WIDELY THROUGH HIS VAINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DESTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATERS WHO CROUDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARINA HERMONE
Line_2612	TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HEARMONE PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONER THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
Line_2613	WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
Line_2614	WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
Line_2615	AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH A WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND PORING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HERTOHIS HEART
Line_2616	ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBED UP ALMOST TO BRIRSTING
Line_2617	HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORRISTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONNINSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWARS HAD SCARSE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREEN WOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATELESTAINE WAS LAID

Line_2645	MEANWHILE THE BLACK NIGHT HAD LED ITS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VEGOUROUS WAS THEIR SOULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN

Line_2876	IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FIND ME NOW TO MOR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
Line_2877	HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MARDEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LEOKWAGGET WAS WANTED TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOKS THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DROARS ALLDAY
Line_2878	RACE LEAK LARE LEAQS WHAT ARE YOU NOW

Line_2881	SO YOU EVEN A WITCH FROUWNED
Line_2882	SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARCIEL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ADO A BALLETT
Line_2883	THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARCIAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TUTCHING TO LEVEN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLYY MAN
Line_2884	AND THE MARCIL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
Line_2885	HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUSTED IT THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREET INTO THE BACKGROUND
Line_2886	TOTS PLEASE BEASLY
Line_2887	ON LOANING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT CLERVOFF TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN THE SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPT GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOCCICATED TO THE MEETING

Line_2889	LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DOSITION ABOUT FLEIRVOF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
Line_2890	BUT LEVEN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXOLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
Line_2891	TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE E FRESHMAN BAR

Line_2928	HE'S SUCH A BLANK GAR'D
Line_2929	THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TWREETED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY

Line_0	HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
Line_1	OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
Line_2	THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR

Line_7	THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
Line_8	DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
Line_9	AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HAROLD I SHOULD JUDGE
Line_10	ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
Line_11	OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
Line_12	THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
Line_13	YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
Line_14	WHAT CAN IT HAVE BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
Line_15	YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
Line_16	AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL AROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
Line_17	THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
Line_18	HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING INTO HIS STATE ROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
Line_19	A VENTRILOQUIST ABOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
Line_20	THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
Line_21	NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
Line_22	WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
Line_23	TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DALYS WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
Line_24	NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
Line_25	THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
Line_26	SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
Line_27	AND HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAS ANSWERED OUR PETITIONS
Line_28	YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
Line_29	THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS ON THE MIND
Line_30	A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
Line_31	AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TO
Line_32	AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
Line_33	LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
Line_34	WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMEN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
Line_35	AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
Line_36	BESIDE OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING
Line_37	IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
Line_38	IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
Line_39	THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
Line_40	THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
Line_41	NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
Line_42	WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND THAT BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
Line_43	NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
Line_44	OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
Line_45	THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREENBACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
Line_46	I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
Line_47	AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
Line_48	NO SIR HE IS NOT HERE
Line_49	MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
Line_50	HENCE A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
Line_51	THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
Line_52	THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKLEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
Line_53	I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
Line_54	BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
Line_55	FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GOD'S
Line_56	A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
Line_57	HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
Line_58	AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
Line_59	WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE
Line_60	IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
Line_61	IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOURSELF
Line_62	IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
Line_63	THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THAT MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
Line_64	WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
Line_65	THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
Line_66	WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
Line_67	BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
Line_68	WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN T'OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
Line_69	I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN'T BUT THEMSELVES
Line_70	INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
Line_71	HERE ARE SOME VERSES OF COWLEY'S TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
Line_72	BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRIT BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
Line_73	SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
Line_74	DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
Line_75	YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
Line_76	HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
Line_77	MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
Line_78	IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
Line_79	WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
Line_80	HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
Line_81	I SEE YOU CAN CHIDE WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
Line_82	I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT HASTENED
Line_83	FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
Line_84	MY POOR LADY VAVASOUR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
Line_85	I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
Line_86	YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
Line_87	BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
Line_88	IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
Line_89	THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
Line_90	I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
Line_91	WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
Line_92	THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
Line_93	DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
Line_94	WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
Line_95	YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE ERE THIS THAT I SCAPED DROWNING
Line_96	NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
Line_97	YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
Line_98	BUT I AM CALLED UPON
Line_99	EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEAS COD WITH NINE PEAS IN'T UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
Line_100	IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
Line_101	MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
Line_102	I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
Line_103	IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE IT
Line_104	I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
Line_105	ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THREE S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
Line_106	WELL THE BEST ON'T IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
Line_107	IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
Line_108	HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
Line_109	BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
Line_110	WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GARLAND
Line_111	WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
Line_112	WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
Line_113	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEKE MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
Line_114	HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THESE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
Line_115	I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
Line_116	I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
Line_117	TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
Line_118	BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
Line_119	AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
Line_120	HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
Line_121	I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
Line_122	MISTER FISH IS THE SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
Line_123	THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN'T UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
Line_124	I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
Line_125	YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
Line_126	BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
Line_127	DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
Line_128	BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
Line_129	NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
Line_130	THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
Line_131	AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
Line_132	THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
Line_133	HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
Line_134	PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
Line_135	HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
Line_136	WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
Line_137	UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
Line_138	WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
Line_139	BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
Line_140	TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
Line_141	AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BASSORAH
Line_142	EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
Line_143	BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
Line_144	HAPLY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
Line_145	NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
Line_146	THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
Line_147	KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
Line_148	I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
Line_149	SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
Line_150	WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
Line_151	I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
Line_152	HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
Line_153	SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
Line_154	SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
Line_155	THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
Line_156	WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
Line_157	FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
Line_158	I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
Line_159	WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
Line_160	THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ AWHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WHOSO COMETH HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
Line_161	BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLOMB TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
Line_162	THEN SIGHING FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND COMORIN ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
Line_163	SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
Line_164	PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
Line_165	BY ALLAH O MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY
Line_166	QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY
Line_167	AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT AND MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
Line_168	WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
Line_169	SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
Line_170	BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER

Line_179	THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
Line_180	AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH

Line_189	YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
Line_190	BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
Line_191	FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
Line_192	THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
Line_193	IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
Line_194	OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES

Line_199	SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
Line_200	OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
Line_201	WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
Line_202	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
Line_203	BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
Line_204	AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
Line_205	THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
Line_206	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
Line_207	HE ASKED AH IT IS
Line_208	BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
Line_209	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
Line_210	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
Line_211	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
Line_212	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
Line_213	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
Line_214	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
Line_215	AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
Line_216	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
Line_217	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
Line_218	GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
Line_219	THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
Line_220	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
Line_221	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
Line_222	EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
Line_223	THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
Line_224	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES AN OPPRESSOR
Line_225	AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
Line_226	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
Line_227	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
Line_228	THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_229	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
Line_230	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
Line_231	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
Line_232	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
Line_233	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
Line_234	IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
Line_235	THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
Line_236	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
Line_237	THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
Line_238	THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
Line_239	WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
Line_240	THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
Line_241	AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
Line_242	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
Line_243	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
Line_244	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
Line_245	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
Line_246	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
Line_247	GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
Line_248	THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
Line_249	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
Line_250	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
Line_251	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
Line_252	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
Line_253	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
Line_254	THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
Line_255	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
Line_256	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
Line_257	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
Line_258	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
Line_259	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
Line_260	INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
Line_261	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
Line_262	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
Line_263	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
Line_264	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
Line_265	BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
Line_266	FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
Line_267	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
Line_268	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
Line_269	WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
Line_270	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
Line_271	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
Line_272	THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
Line_273	THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
Line_274	POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
Line_275	HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
Line_276	HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
Line_277	IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
Line_278	SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
Line_279	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
Line_280	HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
Line_281	THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
Line_282	OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
Line_283	SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
Line_284	IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
Line_285	RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
Line_286	THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
Line_287	OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
Line_288	MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
Line_289	IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
Line_290	RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME A THOUSAND NAMES
Line_291	OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS FARRINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
Line_292	I WANT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
Line_293	WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_294	THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
Line_295	IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
Line_296	SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
Line_297	HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
Line_298	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
Line_299	THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
Line_300	THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
Line_301	THEY WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
Line_302	SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
Line_303	THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
Line_304	IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
Line_305	CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
Line_306	OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
Line_307	WHEN MISS BIRDSEYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
Line_308	I LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRENTS MISSUS FARRINDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
Line_309	OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
Line_310	OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
Line_311	PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
Line_312	ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
Line_313	SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
Line_314	IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
Line_315	THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
Line_316	ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
Line_317	SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
Line_318	THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
Line_319	HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
Line_320	NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
Line_321	I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
Line_322	BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
Line_323	SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
Line_324	HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
Line_325	ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
Line_326	SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
Line_327	MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
Line_328	HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
Line_329	SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
Line_330	THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
Line_331	HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
Line_332	THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
Line_333	HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
Line_334	AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
Line_335	AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
Line_336	IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
Line_337	AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
Line_338	THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
Line_339	WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
Line_340	THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
Line_341	JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK A DAY ASPECT
Line_342	WHAT WE WANT IS TO GO OUT OF HERE QUIET AND TALK THIS SHOW UP AND SELL THE REST OF THE TOWN
Line_343	EVERYBODY SINGS OUT SOLD
Line_344	WHEN I WAKED UP JUST AT DAYBREAK HE WAS SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWIXT HIS KNEES MOANING AND MOURNING TO HIMSELF
Line_345	JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN
Line_346	WELL IT DON'T BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREED I RECKON THEY'RE ALL ALIKE
Line_347	YOU BET IT IS THE JEDGE IS RIGHT EVERYBODY SINGS OUT
Line_348	BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS HOLD ON

Line_352	ANDBUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JUST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
Line_353	WELL THEY ALL DO JIM
Line_354	WE NEVER SHOWED A LIGHT TILL WE WAS ABOUT TEN MILE BELOW THE VILLAGE

Line_356	GREENHORNS FLATHEADS
Line_357	JIS AS LOUD AS I COULD YELL
Line_358	WELL HENRY HE TAKES A NOTION HE WANTS TO GET UP SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS COUNTRY
Line_359	WE STRUCK THE RAFT AT THE SAME TIME AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS WE WAS GLIDING DOWN STREAM ALL DARK AND STILL AND EDGING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOBODY SAYING A WORD
Line_360	TAKE THEM ALL AROUND THEY'RE A MIGHTY ORNERY LOT IT'S THE WAY THEY'RE RAISED
Line_361	IT DON'T SEEM NATURAL BUT I RECKON IT'S SO
Line_362	THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
Line_363	HE WAS OFTEN MOANING AND MOURNING THAT WAY NIGHTS WHEN HE JUDGED I WAS ASLEEP AND SAYING PO LITTLE LIZABETH
Line_364	THE DUKE SAYS YES
Line_365	TWENTY PEOPLE SINGS OUT

Line_377	IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE BUT I SAYS
Line_378	I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
Line_379	WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
Line_380	SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH
Line_381	WHY CHILD IT LL BE STOLE
Line_382	WELL IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HURT
Line_383	I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
Line_384	THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAYS
Line_385	I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS IT
Line_386	UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
Line_387	MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS
Line_388	YOU MUST A MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU OLDISH MAN WITH A
Line_389	BEING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER

Line_391	PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILLS STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS

Line_395	I OUT WITH A YES'M BEFORE I THOUGHT
Line_396	I SEE I WAS IN A FIX NOW
Line_397	THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
Line_398	PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
Line_399	I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS

Line_425	THEY GIVE A GLANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NODDED THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHAT D I TELL YOU
Line_426	SO THEN THEY WAITED FOR A STEAMBOAT
Line_427	HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME DOWN THE RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS
Line_428	I'M GOING IN A SHIP NEXT WEDNESDAY FOR RYO JANEERO WHERE MY UNCLE LIVES
Line_429	WAS PETER WILKS WELL OFF
Line_430	OLD PETER HAD FRIENDS AND THEY AIN'T GOING TO LET THEM COME TO NO HARM
Line_431	SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
Line_432	THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
Line_433	HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS

Line_493	BUT SAID FRANZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
Line_494	WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE

Line_507	MY DEAR FRANZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
Line_508	FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
Line_509	WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
Line_510	AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE

Line_512	MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND EXCELLENT NEIGHBOR REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
Line_513	THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
Line_514	TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINCTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY

Line_522	TO SOME WITH A SMART SOUSE ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFF SWAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOMEPUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
Line_523	ALTHOUGH THE PLAGUE WAS THERE IN THE MOST PART OF ALL THE HOUSES THEY NEVERTHELESS ENTERED EVERYWHERE THEN PLUNDERED AND CARRIED AWAY ALL THAT WAS WITHIN AND YET FOR ALL THIS NOT ONE OF THEM TOOK ANY HURT WHICH IS A MOST WONDERFUL CASE
Line_524	LORD GOD DA MIHI POTUM
Line_525	CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID IT

Line_527	HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SANCT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT IF THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE

Line_531	LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE
Line_532	WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
Line_533	BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
Line_534	TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPONDYLES OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BALAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOWER
Line_535	HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
Line_536	ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATI ILU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
Line_537	THE SHIFTY MATI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHARDURIS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
Line_538	DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URARTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
Line_539	SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHALLUM
Line_540	HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
Line_541	JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE

Line_546	IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHUR BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
Line_547	THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
Line_548	UKINZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
Line_549	NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENAHEM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
Line_550	TIGLATH PILESER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE URARTIAN ARMY IN QUMMUKH
Line_551	ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
Line_552	TIGLATH PILESER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
Line_553	ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
Line_554	HE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
Line_555	AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING

Line_610	LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
Line_611	ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
Line_612	OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
Line_613	IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
Line_614	CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
Line_615	CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
Line_616	HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
Line_617	NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
Line_618	THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
Line_619	HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
Line_620	THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
Line_621	I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
Line_622	WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
Line_623	THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
Line_624	THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
Line_625	MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
Line_626	YES SIR HE SAID
Line_627	WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
Line_628	MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
Line_629	WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
Line_630	THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
Line_631	SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
Line_632	THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
Line_633	I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
Line_634	A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
Line_635	BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
Line_636	THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
Line_637	WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
Line_638	HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
Line_639	JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
Line_640	FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
Line_641	A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
Line_642	THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES
Line_643	HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY
Line_644	THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
Line_645	UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
Line_646	HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
Line_647	SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
Line_648	IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
Line_649	ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
Line_650	CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
Line_651	WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
Line_652	CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
Line_653	BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
Line_654	HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
Line_655	HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
Line_656	THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
Line_657	MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
Line_658	SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
Line_659	THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
Line_660	THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
Line_661	THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
Line_662	WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
Line_663	HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
Line_664	MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED
Line_665	CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
Line_666	IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
Line_667	HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
Line_668	DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY
Line_669	THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
Line_670	HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
Line_671	YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
Line_672	MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
Line_673	I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
Line_674	NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
Line_675	I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
Line_676	THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
Line_677	HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
Line_678	CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
Line_679	GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
Line_680	THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
Line_681	THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
Line_682	WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
Line_683	HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
Line_684	CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE
Line_685	THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
Line_686	IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
Line_687	THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
Line_688	WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
Line_689	CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
Line_690	CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
Line_691	WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK
Line_692	HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
Line_693	THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
Line_694	NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
Line_695	THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
Line_696	A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
Line_697	THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
Line_698	HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
Line_699	THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
Line_700	KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAD THAT'S JAKEY HARRIS
Line_701	HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
Line_702	SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN
Line_703	CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
Line_704	AW SHUCKS
Line_705	ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
Line_706	MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
Line_707	AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
Line_708	CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
Line_709	MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
Line_710	ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
Line_711	WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
Line_712	AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
Line_713	THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB
Line_714	A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
Line_715	MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
Line_716	HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
Line_717	BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM
Line_718	ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
Line_719	O K HE SAID
Line_720	BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
Line_721	CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
Line_722	THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
Line_723	AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE
Line_724	THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET SEE
Line_725	PHUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHERE ALI
Line_726	ANYHOW HE AND PHUT DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
Line_727	BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YO FIGGER ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AN GIVE UP FISHIN
Line_728	AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
Line_729	WE'VE GOT OUR MAN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
Line_730	THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
Line_731	YES IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
Line_732	AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
Line_733	AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
Line_734	WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
Line_735	NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
Line_736	RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
Line_737	I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNG MAN
Line_738	PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
Line_739	AND DONOVAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SKEPTICAL
Line_740	YOU'RE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
Line_741	YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HAND AND IN A WOMAN'S
Line_742	YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
Line_743	ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
Line_744	PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YEP
Line_745	BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
Line_746	I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
Line_747	LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
Line_748	THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
Line_749	MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
Line_750	GAD EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
Line_751	IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
Line_752	NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
Line_753	SINGA PHUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
Line_754	AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
Line_755	NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
Line_756	AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
Line_757	THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
Line_758	AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
Line_759	SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH
Line_760	CARROLL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
Line_761	IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I'LL LAND MY FISH
Line_762	BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
Line_763	I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAUGHED KENNETH
Line_764	I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
Line_765	SOME ONE OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
Line_766	IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
Line_767	ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
Line_768	ALL RIGHT BE THERE IN A SECOND
Line_769	I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
Line_770	BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
Line_771	GET READY SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
Line_772	BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
Line_773	IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
Line_774	DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
Line_775	AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
Line_776	AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
Line_777	SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
Line_778	TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
Line_779	BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
Line_780	AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEADPENCIL
Line_781	WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
Line_782	HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
Line_783	SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
Line_784	AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
Line_785	BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
Line_786	IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
Line_787	I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
Line_788	AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
Line_789	THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
Line_790	IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
Line_791	NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
Line_792	CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
Line_793	IT WAS HIGH LARCH
Line_794	I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
Line_795	THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
Line_796	MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
Line_797	THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
Line_798	LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
Line_799	SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT UP
Line_800	NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
Line_801	BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
Line_802	WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
Line_803	IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT
Line_804	AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
Line_805	BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE
Line_806	THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
Line_807	I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
Line_808	I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
Line_809	I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
Line_810	SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
Line_811	TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
Line_812	LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
Line_813	BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
Line_814	NOW HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
Line_815	AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
Line_816	AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
Line_817	WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKED
Line_818	DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
Line_819	THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
Line_820	NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
Line_821	STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
Line_822	GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
Line_823	THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
Line_824	IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
Line_825	THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
Line_826	I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
Line_827	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
Line_828	AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED
Line_829	IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
Line_830	THANK YOU NO
Line_831	ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
Line_832	IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
Line_833	SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
Line_834	THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
Line_835	HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
Line_836	HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
Line_837	GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH RABBIT
Line_838	THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
Line_839	THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
Line_840	IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
Line_841	FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
Line_842	TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
Line_843	IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
Line_844	BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
Line_845	IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
Line_846	I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
Line_847	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
Line_848	POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
Line_849	IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
Line_850	IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
Line_851	FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
Line_852	CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
Line_853	PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
Line_854	FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
Line_855	NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
Line_856	POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
Line_857	THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
Line_858	ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
Line_859	IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
Line_860	I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
Line_861	SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS
Line_862	SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
Line_863	BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
Line_864	NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
Line_865	FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
Line_866	SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
Line_867	POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
Line_868	HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
Line_869	WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAWS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
Line_870	LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
Line_871	THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
Line_872	HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SILLY TATTLERS SAY
Line_873	I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
Line_874	HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
Line_875	HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
Line_876	I M ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
Line_877	AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
Line_878	BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
Line_879	TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAID
Line_880	I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
Line_881	THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
Line_882	PERHAPS SHE LL JILT HIM
Line_883	DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
Line_884	WAGGING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
Line_885	SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PUTTEL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
Line_886	THANK YOU NO
Line_887	AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
Line_888	UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
Line_889	HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
Line_890	MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
Line_891	THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROTHS ANSWERED POLLY
Line_892	HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N'T THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
Line_893	NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N'T HE PROPOSED
Line_894	I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
Line_895	TRULY TRULY FAN
Line_896	SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
Line_897	THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
Line_898	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
Line_899	JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
Line_900	SHE REALLY COULD N'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
Line_901	WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
Line_902	SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BRILLIANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
Line_903	I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
Line_904	ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
Line_905	WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
Line_906	POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
Line_907	A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
Line_908	NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
Line_909	I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
Line_910	BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
Line_911	IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
Line_912	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE CLEVERLY
Line_913	LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
Line_914	THE CHIEF ORGANISER RANG OFF
Line_915	FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
Line_916	UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAFF'S GUILT
Line_917	CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER
Line_918	A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
Line_919	THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
Line_920	THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
Line_921	OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
Line_922	A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
Line_923	THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
Line_924	WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
Line_925	IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ROOMS AT NEMESIS
Line_926	OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
Line_927	HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADPROP IS IN TO NIGHT
Line_928	THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
Line_929	DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
Line_930	THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
Line_931	HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
Line_932	HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
Line_933	SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
Line_934	THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
Line_935	POLL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
Line_936	ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
Line_937	THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
Line_938	LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER
Line_939	THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
Line_940	NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTERBAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
Line_941	HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO
Line_942	THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MAJORITY
Line_943	AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
Line_944	HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
Line_945	SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
Line_946	IS PLATTERBAFF OUT YET
Line_947	EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WILL VOTE THE OTHER WAY

Line_1218	ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LEXINGTON WEEKLY
Line_1219	MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
Line_1220	EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
Line_1221	WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
Line_1222	THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL PITTS CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
Line_1223	AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
Line_1224	ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
Line_1225	THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
Line_1226	WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
Line_1227	WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
Line_1228	GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
Line_1229	CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
Line_1230	IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
Line_1231	AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
Line_1232	MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
Line_1233	J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
Line_1234	I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
Line_1235	WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
Line_1236	DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
Line_1237	CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
Line_1238	THE MAN REPLIED COMPLETELY
Line_1239	THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
Line_1240	THE GRAVE DIGGER YES
Line_1241	STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE
Line_1242	THE MAN REPLIED
Line_1243	YOU I
Line_1244	MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
Line_1245	THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
Line_1246	MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOWN HALL
Line_1247	IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
Line_1248	THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
Line_1249	SO FATHER MESTIENNE IS DEAD
Line_1250	BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
Line_1251	FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS THAT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
Line_1252	SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
Line_1253	A MOURNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
Line_1254	FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
Line_1255	THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN TO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
Line_1256	A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
Line_1257	THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTE BOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTIENNE DIED
Line_1258	FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST
Line_1259	THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
Line_1260	FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
Line_1261	ONE MUST EAT
Line_1262	THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
Line_1263	FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
Line_1264	HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
Line_1265	THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
Line_1266	HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
Line_1267	FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIBIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
Line_1268	THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
Line_1269	RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
Line_1270	IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
Line_1271	THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
Line_1272	IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
Line_1273	AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
Line_1274	DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
Line_1275	TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
Line_1276	ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
Line_1277	HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
Line_1278	HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
Line_1279	BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
Line_1280	BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
Line_1281	THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
Line_1282	HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTIENNE
Line_1283	THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY PERE LACHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
Line_1284	DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR IS HE IS A JUG OF RED WINE
Line_1285	ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
Line_1286	JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
Line_1287	BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
Line_1288	FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
Line_1289	FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
Line_1290	YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
Line_1291	HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
Line_1292	WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
Line_1293	IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
Line_1294	WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
Line_1295	THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
Line_1296	ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
Line_1297	IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
Line_1298	TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
Line_1299	FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
Line_1300	WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
Line_1301	NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
Line_1302	JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING
Line_1303	ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
Line_1304	YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
Line_1305	BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
Line_1306	YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
Line_1307	THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
Line_1308	FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
Line_1309	EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
Line_1310	AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
Line_1311	FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
Line_1312	THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
Line_1313	HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
Line_1314	ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
Line_1315	NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
Line_1316	JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
Line_1317	AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
Line_1318	IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
Line_1319	I SHALL BE HUNGRY I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
Line_1320	HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
Line_1321	COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
Line_1322	THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
Line_1323	WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
Line_1324	THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
Line_1325	JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
Line_1326	THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
Line_1327	I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
Line_1328	WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
Line_1329	I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
Line_1330	THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
Line_1331	THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
Line_1332	THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
Line_1333	ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
Line_1334	YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
Line_1335	WHO SPREADS THE PALL OVER IT
Line_1336	COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
Line_1337	THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
Line_1338	ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
Line_1339	AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
Line_1340	AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED AH
Line_1341	YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
Line_1342	FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
Line_1343	YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
Line_1344	WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
Line_1345	YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
Line_1346	THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
Line_1347	A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
Line_1348	THIS OFFERS THE MEANS BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
Line_1349	BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
Line_1350	IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
Line_1351	BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
Line_1352	BE QUICK THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I WANT TO GET AWAY AT ONCE
Line_1353	YOU LAUGHED AND FLEERED AT ME WHEN I WAS ON THE CUTTER'S DECK
Line_1354	THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
Line_1355	WON'T DO SAID RAM GRINNING
Line_1356	THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
Line_1357	IT WAS YOU FATHER KICKED FOR SHIRKING AND MY WELL I HARDLY KNOWED YOU
Line_1358	A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS BREAST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN
Line_1359	NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED ITSELF
Line_1360	STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY NANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
Line_1361	I'M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
Line_1362	NONSENSE
Line_1363	I TOLD YOU A FISHER BOY CRIED ARCHY IMPATIENTLY BUT TRYING NOT TO OFFEND HIS VISITOR WHO POSSESSED THE POWER OF CONFERRING FREEDOM BY SPEAKING SHARPLY
Line_1364	IT WAS YOUR TURN YESTERDAY IT'S MINE TO DAY WHAT A GAME
Line_1365	RAM SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE BURST OUT WITH A LONG LOW FIT OF LAUGHTER
Line_1366	HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
Line_1367	HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
Line_1368	NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE
Line_1369	ARCHY STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
Line_1370	BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
Line_1371	OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
Line_1372	BEEN PLAYING THE SPY THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING WHO LOCKED YOU IN
Line_1373	GO ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE
Line_1374	I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AND WONDERED WHOSE BOY YOU WAS
Line_1375	WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
Line_1376	ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
Line_1377	HULLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU
Line_1378	GUINEA SAID THE BOY THINK I'D DO IT FOR A GUINEA WELL THEN TWO
Line_1379	WHY YOUR CLOTHES DON'T FIT YOU AND YOUR CAP'S PUT ON ALL SKEW REW
Line_1380	NOT YOU LOOK LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE LIKE A MONKEY YOU INSOLENT
Line_1381	ARCHY CHECKED HIMSELF AND THE BOY LAUGHED
Line_1382	NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
Line_1383	YOU ROPE'S END ME HE SAID
Line_1384	WHY I COULD TIE YOU UP IN A KNOT AND HEAVE YOU OFF THE CLIFF ANY DAY WHAT A GAME
Line_1385	RAM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
Line_1386	THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU MISTER ORFICER
Line_1387	TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
Line_1388	SHALL I COME TOO FATHER NO
Line_1389	WON'T DO SAID RAM QUICKLY I KNOW YOU
Line_1390	BUT I'LL YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT
Line_1391	AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
Line_1392	AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
Line_1393	WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
Line_1394	NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
Line_1395	BIT OF A MIDDY FED ON SALT TACK AND WEEVILLY BISCUIT TALK OF GIVING ME ROPE'S END
Line_1396	SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
Line_1397	I SAY YOU DO LOOK A RUM UN JUST LIKE A BIG MONKEY IN A SHOW
Line_1398	NOT YOU ONLY A SHAM
Line_1399	TO HIS ASTONISHMENT THE BOY DID NOT FLINCH BUT THRUST HIS OWN ARMS THROUGH PLACING THEM ABOUT THE MIDDY'S WAIST CLENCHING HIS HANDS BEHIND AND UTTERING A SHARP WHISTLE
Line_1400	THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
Line_1401	ONCE MORE WILL YOU COME AND LET ME OUT NO
Line_1402	SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
Line_1403	IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
Line_1404	THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAEME HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
Line_1405	FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
Line_1406	COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
Line_1407	HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
Line_1408	A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
Line_1409	BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
Line_1410	THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
Line_1411	DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
Line_1412	I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
Line_1413	THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
Line_1414	A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
Line_1415	NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
Line_1416	PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHY WAS SILENT
Line_1417	THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
Line_1418	NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
Line_1419	HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
Line_1420	NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
Line_1421	AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
Line_1422	TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
Line_1423	I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
Line_1424	YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
Line_1425	HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
Line_1426	I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
Line_1427	YES SIR OF COURSE
Line_1428	HE SWUNG ROUND WALKED AFT AND BEGAN SWEEPING THE SHORE AGAIN WITH HIS GLASS WHILE THE MASTER AND DICK EXCHANGED GLANCES WHICH MEANT A GREAT DEAL
Line_1429	WHAT FOR THERE AREN'T A PUBLIC HOUSE FOR TEN MILES DIDN'T MEAN THAT
Line_1430	BEG PARDON SIR DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM

Line_1467	GURR TURNED AWAY IMPATIENTLY AGAIN AND SIGNING TO HIS MEN TO FOLLOW THEY ALL BEGAN TO TRAMP UP THE STEEP TRACK LEADING TOWARD THE HOZE WITH THE RABBITS SCUTTLING AWAY AMONG THE FURZE AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE COTTONY TAILS FOR A MOMENT AS THEY DARTED DOWN INTO THEIR HOLES
Line_1468	I HOPE NOT DICK I HOPE NOT BUT SMUGGLERS DON'T STAND AT ANYTHING SOMETIMES
Line_1469	I SAID A LAD BOUT SEVENTEEN IN A RED CAP LIKE YOURS SAID GURR VERY SHORTLY

Line_1487	I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SHIP MOST ESPECIALLY IN MODERATE WEATHER
Line_1488	THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH
Line_1489	I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIKES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
Line_1490	I DOUBT IF WE TOUCHED A MAN IN THE NEAREST PROA

Line_1493	I SANG OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
Line_1494	AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE ONE FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT
Line_1495	MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
Line_1496	THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
Line_1497	HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
Line_1498	THE PROAS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
Line_1499	PROAS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY SHIPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
Line_1500	ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERN MOST PROA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
Line_1501	MISTER MARBLE HE I DO BELIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HEN COOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BARELY ASLEEP
Line_1502	AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
Line_1503	THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
Line_1504	KITE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
Line_1505	THE JOHN BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TOP
Line_1506	THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
Line_1507	NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JOHN WAS HURT
Line_1508	ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
Line_1509	AS OUR SHEETS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
Line_1510	I SOON SAW BOTH PROAS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
Line_1511	ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION
Line_1512	ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
Line_1513	EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
Line_1514	THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
Line_1515	SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
Line_1516	WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
Line_1517	THEY HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
Line_1518	THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGULATION QUOTED OF SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
Line_1519	BLACKBURN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
Line_1520	SOMETIMES TOBACCO WAS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTING OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES
Line_1521	PARR WAS SUCH A CONTINUAL SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
Line_1522	LET THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
Line_1523	ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITCHFIELD HE HAD AN EXTRA PIPE AND JOSHUA THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING IMPATIENT
Line_1524	GOING TO CHURCH AT HAYES IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXCITING EXPERIENCE
Line_1525	DAVID DEANS HOWEVER DID NOT AT ALL APPROVE THIS IRREVERENCE
Line_1526	LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
Line_1527	WAS MOSES JUSTIFIED IN RESISTING THE EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER
Line_1528	THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
Line_1529	NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
Line_1530	THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURAL INEVITABLE
Line_1531	THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
Line_1532	HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
Line_1533	NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
Line_1534	THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES
Line_1535	THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS
Line_1536	THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
Line_1537	MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
Line_1538	FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C
Line_1539	THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
Line_1540	HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUST AND STRONG GOD ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
Line_1541	HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
Line_1542	THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
Line_1543	IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
Line_1544	THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
Line_1545	THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUHIT
Line_1546	THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
Line_1547	AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
Line_1548	LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
Line_1549	THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
Line_1550	THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
Line_1551	WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM A DESPOTIC RULER OF THAT LAND AND DAY
Line_1552	DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
Line_1553	A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
Line_1554	EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
Line_1555	ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
Line_1556	IS PEONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
Line_1557	HOLD ON HOLD FAST HOLD OUT PATIENCE IS GENIUS
Line_1558	THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
Line_1559	THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
Line_1560	THE LATER TRADITIONS TEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
Line_1561	MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
Line_1562	THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
Line_1563	THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
Line_1564	THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
Line_1565	IT CANNOT BE THE MOOR ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE FOR THOSE UNDER ENCHANTMENT DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN BY ANYONE
Line_1566	I SAY SO CONTINUED DON QUIXOTE BECAUSE I HATE TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S GOOD NAME
Line_1567	SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
Line_1568	TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
Line_1569	MINE COULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
Line_1570	DIDN'T I SAY SO WORSE LUCK TO MY LINE SAID SANCHO
Line_1571	THEN THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
Line_1572	DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
Line_1573	IF THEY DON'T LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN THEY LET THEMSELVES BE FELT SAID SANCHO IF NOT LET MY SHOULDERS SPEAK TO THE POINT
Line_1574	THOUGH YOUR WORSHIP WAS NOT SO BADLY OFF HAVING IN YOUR ARMS THAT INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY YOU SPOKE OF BUT I WHAT DID I HAVE EXCEPT THE HEAVIEST WHACKS I THINK I HAD IN ALL MY LIFE
Line_1575	SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
Line_1576	SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
Line_1577	THE OFFICER TURNED TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
Line_1578	AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
Line_1579	IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
Line_1580	I SWEAR IT ANSWERED SANCHO
Line_1581	I SAY REPLIED SANCHO THAT I SWEAR TO HOLD MY TONGUE ABOUT IT TILL THE END OF YOUR WORSHIP'S DAYS AND GOD GRANT I MAY BE ABLE TO LET IT OUT TOMORROW
Line_1582	UNLUCKY ME AND THE MOTHER THAT BORE ME
Line_1583	SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANTED TO CURE ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
Line_1584	THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
Line_1585	HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
Line_1586	RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY SHELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH BUTTER TO FINISH THE SOUP
Line_1587	PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES
Line_1588	GOBEY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
Line_1589	A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
Line_1590	ALL OF THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM
Line_1591	ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSOMME AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR
Line_1592	WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
Line_1593	IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DELMONICO
Line_1594	TAKE THIRTY CRAWFISH FROM WHICH REMOVE THE GUT CONTAINING THE GALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TAKE FIRM HOLD OF THE CRAWFISH WITH THE LEFT HAND SO AS TO AVOID BEING PINCHED BY ITS CLAWS WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND PINCH THE EXTREME END OF THE CENTRAL FIN OF THE TAIL AND WITH A SUDDEN JERK THE GUT WILL BE WITHDRAWN
Line_1595	SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOF BRAU HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
Line_1596	PUT THESE INGREDIENTS INTO A STEWPAN AND FRY THEM TEN MINUTES THEN THROW IN THE CRAWFISH AND POUR ON THEM HALF A BOTTLE OF FRENCH WHITE WINE
Line_1597	SOAK THE CRAB MEAT IN THE SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING
Line_1598	SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH THIN SLICES OF DRY TOAST
Line_1599	ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT

Line_1601	LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG
Line_1602	THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
Line_1603	LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
Line_1604	KING OF SHELL FISH

Line_1606	ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELL FISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
Line_1607	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBEY'S OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
Line_1608	BISQUE OF CRAWFISH
Line_1609	LOBSTER IN MINIATURE
Line_1610	THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE
Line_1611	THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
Line_1612	SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
Line_1613	TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL OF THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
Line_1614	GOBEY'S CRAB STEW

Line_1617	CHOP FINE THE ONION SWEET PEPPER AND TOMATO WITH THE ROSEMARY
Line_1618	PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
Line_1619	I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
Line_1620	SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
Line_1621	FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
Line_1622	AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
Line_1623	IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
Line_1624	ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
Line_1625	WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
Line_1626	HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM
Line_1627	THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
Line_1628	MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
Line_1629	THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
Line_1630	SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE CISEAUX
Line_1631	BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
Line_1632	WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
Line_1633	THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND TO BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
Line_1634	IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
Line_1635	I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
Line_1636	THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
Line_1637	THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
Line_1638	IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
Line_1639	AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
Line_1640	HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTON
Line_1641	THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
Line_1642	TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
Line_1643	AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
Line_1644	A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
Line_1645	BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
Line_1646	BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
Line_1647	IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
Line_1648	BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
Line_1649	HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
Line_1650	THE STORY OF FRIDOLIN AND RETZCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
Line_1651	WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
Line_1652	SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
Line_1653	HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
Line_1654	AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
Line_1655	THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
Line_1656	IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
Line_1657	IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
Line_1658	WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
Line_1659	HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
Line_1660	ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
Line_1661	MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
Line_1662	REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
Line_1663	HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
Line_1664	MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
Line_1665	THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
Line_1666	THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
Line_1667	HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
Line_1668	THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
Line_1669	THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
Line_1670	NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
Line_1671	I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
Line_1672	HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
Line_1673	THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
Line_1674	WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1675	SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
Line_1676	TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
Line_1677	DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
Line_1678	HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
Line_1679	HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
Line_1680	YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
Line_1681	WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
Line_1682	HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
Line_1683	I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
Line_1684	AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
Line_1685	HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
Line_1686	WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
Line_1687	BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BANDINELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
Line_1688	AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
Line_1689	I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
Line_1690	I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTORS CRAFT
Line_1691	I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
Line_1692	NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
Line_1693	WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
Line_1694	I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DA CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
Line_1695	I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
Line_1696	THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
Line_1697	YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO
Line_1698	IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
Line_1699	I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
Line_1700	AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
Line_1701	GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIMSELF
Line_1702	A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
Line_1703	I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
Line_1704	THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
Line_1705	WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
Line_1706	THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
Line_1707	MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
Line_1708	WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
Line_1709	ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
Line_1710	THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
Line_1711	THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
Line_1712	PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
Line_1713	FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
Line_1714	WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
Line_1715	NATURE PRODUCES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
Line_1716	EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS

Line_1718	IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
Line_1719	DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
Line_1720	FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
Line_1721	THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
Line_1722	WHAT IS THIS POWER
Line_1723	IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
Line_1724	THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
Line_1725	THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
Line_1726	WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAILED
Line_1727	CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
Line_1728	WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
Line_1729	HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
Line_1730	LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
Line_1731	CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
Line_1732	WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
Line_1733	CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS
Line_1734	THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
Line_1735	HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
Line_1736	WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
Line_1737	IT IS A RESULT
Line_1738	WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
Line_1739	OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACES TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
Line_1740	WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
Line_1741	DID THIS GOD ALLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
Line_1742	A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND

Line_1747	A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
Line_1748	LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
Line_1749	WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
Line_1750	THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
Line_1751	FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
Line_1752	RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED
Line_1753	IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
Line_1754	THEY HATED PLEASURE
Line_1755	HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL

Line_1763	IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
Line_1764	IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
Line_1765	THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
Line_1766	THIS FREES WOMAN
Line_1767	IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
Line_1768	RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE

Line_1770	DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE

Line_1777	MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
Line_1778	AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
Line_1779	LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
Line_1780	WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
Line_1781	FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
Line_1782	IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
Line_1783	IN THE INFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
Line_1784	THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
Line_1785	MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
Line_1786	WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
Line_1787	THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
Line_1788	COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
Line_1789	THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
Line_1790	RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
Line_1791	POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDLESS
Line_1792	DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE

Line_1794	THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
Line_1795	CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
Line_1796	WE MUST HAVE CORNER STONES
Line_1797	IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
Line_1798	AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
Line_1799	IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
Line_1800	SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
Line_1801	A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
Line_1802	NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
Line_1803	HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
Line_1804	BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
Line_1805	BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
Line_1806	I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
Line_1807	I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
Line_1808	MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
Line_1809	BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
Line_1810	I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
Line_1811	BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
Line_1812	PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
Line_1813	I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
Line_1814	I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
Line_1815	ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
Line_1816	HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
Line_1817	NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
Line_1818	NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
Line_1819	PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
Line_1820	THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
Line_1821	NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
Line_1822	PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
Line_1823	YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
Line_1824	THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
Line_1825	BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
Line_1826	MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
Line_1827	WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
Line_1828	SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
Line_1829	AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
Line_1830	HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
Line_1831	I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YO WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
Line_1832	THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
Line_1833	I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
Line_1834	BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
Line_1835	BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
Line_1836	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
Line_1837	THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
Line_1838	I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
Line_1839	JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
Line_1840	AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
Line_1841	REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
Line_1842	PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
Line_1843	SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
Line_1844	SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
Line_1845	AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
Line_1846	MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
Line_1847	BUT WHAT WAS IT
Line_1848	SO THEY LEFT MILTON
Line_1849	OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
Line_1850	I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
Line_1851	TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
Line_1852	HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
Line_1853	VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Line_1854	BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
Line_1855	WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
Line_1856	SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE
Line_1857	THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
Line_1858	ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
Line_1859	WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1860	NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
Line_1861	MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
Line_1862	MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
Line_1863	ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
Line_1864	I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
Line_1865	AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
Line_1866	EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
Line_1867	IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
Line_1868	YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON
Line_1869	SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
Line_1870	YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
Line_1871	I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
Line_1872	IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
Line_1873	BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
Line_1874	I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
Line_1875	THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
Line_1876	MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
Line_1877	THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
Line_1878	BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
Line_1879	MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
Line_1880	HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
Line_1881	DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
Line_1882	BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
Line_1883	NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
Line_1884	HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR
Line_1885	WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
Line_1886	WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
Line_1887	I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
Line_1888	VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
Line_1889	AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
Line_1890	MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
Line_1891	GASPED BESSY AT LAST
Line_1892	BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_1893	I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
Line_1894	I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
Line_1895	I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
Line_1896	WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
Line_1897	IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE FORMED LONG AGO
Line_1898	NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF BAD AS I AM
Line_1899	HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY
Line_1900	AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
Line_1901	CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE SAID
Line_1902	I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU
Line_1903	VAIN HOPE I FEAR
Line_1904	WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WORRY HER TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM
Line_1905	I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
Line_1906	NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES
Line_1907	THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON TO OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS
Line_1908	FIRE AND FURY
Line_1909	MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISTER HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
Line_1910	BUT HANG IT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT
Line_1911	YOU NEVER TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
Line_1912	NOW DON'T BURST INTO A TEMPEST AT THAT
Line_1913	I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS THEM
Line_1914	IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE
Line_1915	BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR SONS TO BE LIKE MISTER HUNTINGDON OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF
Line_1916	WHERE'S MILICENT
Line_1917	NOT YEARS FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE AND TWENTY
Line_1918	I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT D N ME IF I DON'T
Line_1919	OH NO I COULDN'T STAND THAT
Line_1920	NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
Line_1921	NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING HER ROUND AND PUSHING HER TOWARDS ME
Line_1922	GOD HELP ME THEN FOR I'M SURE I NEED IT
Line_1923	MILICENT FLEW TO THANK ME OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE
Line_1924	UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
Line_1925	I SHALL NOT TELL HIM
Line_1926	YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
Line_1927	SUPPOSE I DO
Line_1928	I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
Line_1929	THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
Line_1930	IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
Line_1931	I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
Line_1932	YES YES
Line_1933	GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
Line_1934	BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
Line_1935	FOR NONE COULD INJURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
Line_1936	I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
Line_1937	I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY
Line_1938	SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
Line_1939	I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
Line_1940	HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
Line_1941	YOU USE HARD WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
Line_1942	I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
Line_1943	WILL YOU OBLIGE ME HELEN CONTINUED SHE
Line_1944	AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
Line_1945	IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
Line_1946	AND MILICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
Line_1947	SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER TEETH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
Line_1948	THEY HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
Line_1949	I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
Line_1950	NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
Line_1951	IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KEYS MY DEAR WHAT KEYS
Line_1952	I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
Line_1953	THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
Line_1954	AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
Line_1955	AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREAVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
Line_1956	THAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
Line_1957	NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
Line_1958	THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
Line_1959	MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP STAIRS
Line_1960	I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
Line_1961	MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S THE VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE
Line_1962	HERE BENSON ENTERED WITH THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
Line_1963	HAVE I ATTEMPTED TO DEFRAUD YOU
Line_1964	WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
Line_1965	I SHALL PUT YOU UPON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
Line_1966	I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
Line_1967	A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
Line_1968	THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
Line_1969	I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
Line_1970	LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
Line_1971	I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
Line_1972	I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED
Line_1973	IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
Line_1974	THEY WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
Line_1975	I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
Line_1976	SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
Line_1977	FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVES WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE
Line_1978	PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
Line_1979	THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
Line_1980	I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
Line_1981	THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
Line_1982	OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
Line_1983	I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
Line_1984	MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
Line_1985	WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
Line_1986	I ASKED NO QUESTIONS
Line_1987	ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
Line_1988	THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
Line_1989	THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
Line_1990	IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
Line_1991	I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
Line_1992	THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HOWEVER IS WITH THE KINE AND WHY IS IT NOT WITH THE RICH
Line_1993	IT IS NO LONGER TRUE THAT THE POOR ARE BLESSED
Line_1994	WHAT DO I HERE SEEK
Line_1995	WHO HATH NOT AT PRESENT HIS HEART HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES FULL OF DISGUST
Line_1996	HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
Line_1997	FOR THEY ARE THY WARMEST FRIENDS AND PRECEPTORS
Line_1998	THOU KNOWEST IT THYSELF BETTER EVEN THAN I
Line_1999	THE KINE HOWEVER GAZED AT IT ALL AND WONDERED
Line_2000	THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THE HEART
Line_2001	THUS SPAKE THE PEACEFUL ONE AND PUFFED HIMSELF AND PERSPIRED WITH HIS WORDS SO THAT THE KINE WONDERED ANEW
Line_2002	THOU DOEST VIOLENCE TO THYSELF THOU PREACHER ON THE MOUNT WHEN THOU USEST SUCH SEVERE WORDS
Line_2003	ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH

Line_2070	THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
Line_2071	THEN THE BRAHMAN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
Line_2072	THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE

Line_2074	OH FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
Line_2075	IS IT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
Line_2076	THREE OUT OF THE SIX HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMAN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
Line_2077	THEN SHUT AND BOLT IT SAID THE JACKAL
Line_2078	AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
Line_2079	AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
Line_2080	WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE JACKAL SAID NOW BRAHMAN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
Line_2081	WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
Line_2082	IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
Line_2083	WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
Line_2084	THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID THE JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN
Line_2085	SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMAN
Line_2086	BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME

Line_2311	IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
Line_2312	DO COME ANNIE DO
Line_2313	SHE UTTERED HER STRANGE REMARK STANDING UP
Line_2314	BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LESLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
Line_2315	I'M NOT COMING SAID ANNIE
Line_2316	I KNOW YOU DON'T QUITE MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SAID LESLIE BUT OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY WISH ME

Line_2319	REFUSES TO COME SHE CRIED
Line_2320	WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
Line_2321	HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH
Line_2322	THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
Line_2323	YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Line_2324	WHERE THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHOULD DISCOVER IT
Line_2325	THE CASE OF LORD MOUNTNORRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
Line_2326	IT IS NOW FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
Line_2327	MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
Line_2328	THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
Line_2329	LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
Line_2330	IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
Line_2331	THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
Line_2332	YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
Line_2333	A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
Line_2334	THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THIS HALL
Line_2335	UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
Line_2336	THESE LAST WERE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
Line_2337	WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
Line_2338	THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
Line_2339	THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
Line_2340	BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
Line_2341	DOWN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED
Line_2342	HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
Line_2343	ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
Line_2344	HE SPOKE TO THE RUMP CONVENTION
Line_2345	MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
Line_2346	BUT THE PRESENT MOVEMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
Line_2347	WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THEY BELLOWED AT HIM
Line_2348	EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
Line_2349	THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
Line_2350	THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND LAND OWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
Line_2351	WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
Line_2352	THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
Line_2353	WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN
Line_2354	I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
Line_2355	FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
Line_2356	THESE MEN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
Line_2357	BY DECLARING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Line_2358	HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVILS
Line_2359	YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU'RE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
Line_2360	WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKINGMEN LIKE OURSELVES
Line_2361	FOLLOWED HIM LENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
Line_2362	THE DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS WERE DROPPED
Line_2363	ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
Line_2364	IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
Line_2365	ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT
Line_2366	COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
Line_2367	SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
Line_2368	AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
Line_2369	I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD
Line_2370	HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
Line_2371	AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
Line_2372	NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2373	THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
Line_2374	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2375	THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
Line_2376	HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
Line_2377	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDERLAD
Line_2378	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
Line_2379	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED CINDERLAD
Line_2380	THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
Line_2381	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDERLAD
Line_2382	WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
Line_2383	YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
Line_2384	THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
Line_2385	CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
Line_2386	FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
Line_2387	WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
Line_2388	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
Line_2389	THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
Line_2390	BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
Line_2391	THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
Line_2392	SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
Line_2393	ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
Line_2394	SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNIR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT
Line_2395	DIE THOU FAFNIR AND THEN FAFNIR DIED
Line_2396	FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
Line_2397	THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS
Line_2398	ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
Line_2399	THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN
Line_2400	THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
Line_2401	SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
Line_2402	THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
Line_2403	THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
Line_2404	THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
Line_2405	BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
Line_2406	THEN BRYNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
Line_2407	NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
Line_2408	THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
Line_2409	BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
Line_2410	FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRYNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRYNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUIRUN'S SUPERIOR
Line_2411	SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
Line_2412	SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
Line_2413	THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
Line_2414	HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
Line_2415	THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
Line_2416	WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
Line_2417	THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
Line_2418	KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
Line_2419	THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
Line_2420	ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
Line_2421	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
Line_2422	THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
Line_2423	I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
Line_2424	WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
Line_2425	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
Line_2426	SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
Line_2427	AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
Line_2428	OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
Line_2429	NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
Line_2430	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
Line_2431	THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
Line_2432	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
Line_2433	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
Line_2434	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
Line_2435	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
Line_2436	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
Line_2437	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
Line_2438	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
Line_2439	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
Line_2440	BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
Line_2441	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
Line_2442	ICES
Line_2443	AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
Line_2444	MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
Line_2445	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
Line_2446	FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
Line_2447	THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
Line_2448	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
Line_2449	THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
Line_2450	MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
Line_2451	THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
Line_2452	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
Line_2453	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
Line_2454	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
Line_2455	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
Line_2456	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
Line_2457	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
Line_2458	YES SAH SHE SHO'LY WAS PLUMB SCARED
Line_2459	ANYWAY HE WOULD FIND OUT
Line_2460	ONE DAY THIS NO COUNT TRIFLING COUSIN OF GRANDPAP BUZZARD GET COLD IN HIS FEET
Line_2461	SO WE UNS SIT ON THE CHIMNEY TOPS WHENEVER OL JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
Line_2462	THEY LIKE TO CHOKE THAT NO COUNT BUZZARD TO DEATH
Line_2463	WHEN HE GET HOME HE TRY AN TRY TO BRUSH THAT SOOT OFF BUT IT DONE GET INTO THE SKIN AN IT STAY THERE
Line_2464	WHY HE JES STRETCH HIS FOOL HAID AS FAR DOWN THAT CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AN LISTEN AN LISTEN
Line_2465	OL MISTAH BUZZARD GRINNED
Line_2466	NOW OL MISTAH BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BEGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
Line_2467	IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S
Line_2468	HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OL MISTAH BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
Line_2469	WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDPAP BUZZARD HAD HIS LIL FALLING OUT WITH OL KING EAGLE AND DONE FLY SO HIGH HE SCO'TCH THE FEATHERS OFFEN HIS HAID HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRANDPAP BUZZARD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JES NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUNT
Line_2470	EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PETER AND LAUGHED
Line_2471	WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE BUZZARD FAM'LY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AND MEDDLE IN HE COULD ASK MO QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AN ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
Line_2472	LIKE MOST NO COUNT PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NUISANCE OF HISSELF POKING HIS NOSE INTO EV'YBODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
Line_2473	PLEASE MISTER BUZZARD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BEGGED
Line_2474	BUT HE DON'T MIND THAT
Line_2475	WILL YO' ALLS PLEASE SPEAK A LIL LOUDER HE HOLLER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JES LIKE THAT
Line_2476	IT WAS ON A LIL OL HOUSE A LIL OL TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE
Line_2477	THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
Line_2478	A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION WENT AROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
Line_2479	MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
Line_2480	I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
Line_2481	TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
Line_2482	WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
Line_2483	NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
Line_2484	WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
Line_2485	I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
Line_2486	ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
Line_2487	DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
Line_2488	I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
Line_2489	HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
Line_2490	MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
Line_2491	IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
Line_2492	LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
Line_2493	WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
Line_2494	WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
Line_2495	IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
Line_2496	HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
Line_2497	IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
Line_2498	I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
Line_2499	MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
Line_2500	YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
Line_2501	MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
Line_2502	WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
Line_2503	I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
Line_2504	I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
Line_2505	SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
Line_2506	YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
Line_2507	WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
Line_2508	WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
Line_2509	BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
Line_2510	HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
Line_2511	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
Line_2512	HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
Line_2513	THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
Line_2514	THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE
Line_2515	YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
Line_2516	WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
Line_2517	THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
Line_2518	YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONICAL AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
Line_2519	THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
Line_2520	BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
Line_2521	NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
Line_2522	BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISON
Line_2523	MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
Line_2524	WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
Line_2525	I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
Line_2526	DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
Line_2527	THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
Line_2528	NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
Line_2529	THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL
Line_2530	THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
Line_2531	EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSELS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
Line_2532	IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
Line_2533	COME DURING THE THIRD ENTR'ACTE
Line_2534	ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY THE STAGE BOX
Line_2535	WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
Line_2536	YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
Line_2537	IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
Line_2538	THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH
Line_2539	WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
Line_2540	WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
Line_2541	BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
Line_2542	HOW WHY
Line_2543	IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
Line_2544	WHERE AT HOME
Line_2545	YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
Line_2546	THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMON
Line_2547	A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
Line_2548	A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
Line_2549	WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
Line_2550	HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
Line_2551	THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS
Line_2552	IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
Line_2553	HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
Line_2554	THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARES ME I CAN PROVE
Line_2555	TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
Line_2556	WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
Line_2557	SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
Line_2558	THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
Line_2559	THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HERMON INCREDULOUSLY
Line_2560	HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
Line_2561	THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
Line_2562	THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE
Line_2563	THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
Line_2564	HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
Line_2565	HERMON LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
Line_2566	ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMON'S REGARD
Line_2567	WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
Line_2568	SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
Line_2569	LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
Line_2570	THE RHODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
Line_2571	THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
Line_2572	HIS SON HAD BEEN THIS ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
Line_2573	CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
Line_2574	YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOE IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
Line_2575	BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR
Line_2576	WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
Line_2577	HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
Line_2578	SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
Line_2579	SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
Line_2580	SO ARCHIAS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
Line_2581	AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
Line_2582	AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
Line_2583	HONOUR TO MYRTILUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
Line_2584	IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
Line_2585	HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
Line_2586	SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOTELES IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PAINFUL WALK HERMON
Line_2587	OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS
Line_2588	YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
Line_2589	HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMYNTAS THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
Line_2590	THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTILUS
Line_2591	EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
Line_2592	TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
Line_2593	HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
Line_2594	THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
Line_2595	HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
Line_2596	DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
Line_2597	DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
Line_2598	DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPUS SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
Line_2599	BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
Line_2600	IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
Line_2601	LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
Line_2602	EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
Line_2603	WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
Line_2604	WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
Line_2605	BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
Line_2606	NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
Line_2607	I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
Line_2608	CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
Line_2609	BUT HERMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
Line_2610	BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
Line_2611	THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON
Line_2612	TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
Line_2613	WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
Line_2614	WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
Line_2615	AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
Line_2616	ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
Line_2617	HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATHELSTANE WAS LAID
Line_2618	YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
Line_2619	EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN HO
Line_2620	THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
Line_2621	AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
Line_2622	SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
Line_2623	HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THEIR WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
Line_2624	AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
Line_2625	AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
Line_2626	BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
Line_2627	RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
Line_2628	BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
Line_2629	SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
Line_2630	AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
Line_2631	THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
Line_2632	HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
Line_2633	EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
Line_2634	LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ULRICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
Line_2635	THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL RUNG WITH THEIR FURIOUS BLOWS
Line_2636	THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
Line_2637	THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
Line_2638	TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME
Line_2639	TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
Line_2640	DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
Line_2641	HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
Line_2642	REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN
Line_2643	WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
Line_2644	HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
Line_2645	MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
Line_2646	POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
Line_2647	IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE
Line_2648	AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
Line_2649	THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
Line_2650	WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
Line_2651	DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_2652	THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
Line_2653	AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL
Line_2654	THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
Line_2655	BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TO THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
Line_2656	SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEETMEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BHANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHEST AND ALL TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
Line_2657	BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST I HAVE ZAYNAB ALSO NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
Line_2658	WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
Line_2659	AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
Line_2660	KNOWEST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
Line_2661	ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT SELLER WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
Line_2662	REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER O THOU DAUGHTER OF A DOG
Line_2663	NOW THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
Line_2664	AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM DO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
Line_2665	PRESENTLY HASAN SHUMAN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THE GEAR O ALI
Line_2666	HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
Line_2667	QUOTH AL RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
Line_2668	THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAR DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS ALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
Line_2669	THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
Line_2670	SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
Line_2671	SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
Line_2672	SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
Line_2673	BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
Line_2674	HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
Line_2675	YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
Line_2676	SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JOUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
Line_2677	I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
Line_2678	I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
Line_2679	I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
Line_2680	AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PET PLANS
Line_2681	SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
Line_2682	IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
Line_2683	I REMEMBER ALL THE RUBENSES AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
Line_2684	BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
Line_2685	THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
Line_2686	SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
Line_2687	ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
Line_2688	PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY

Line_2695	THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ONTO THE BENCH
Line_2696	IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOR BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORIZED PRECINCT HOUSE
Line_2697	GORDON HAD HEARD OF THE FRIENDLY INTEREST CHARGED ON THE SIDE HERE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WRONG IZZY
Line_2698	GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
Line_2699	THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET
Line_2700	ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
Line_2701	SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
Line_2702	YOU OWE ME SOME BILLS GOV'NOR
Line_2703	LIKE THIS SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM
Line_2704	ELEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CREDITS
Line_2705	AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HALEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
Line_2706	NOW SHOW ME WHERE I SIGNED ANY AGREEMENT SAYING I'D PAY YOU BACK
Line_2707	GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARSPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
Line_2708	WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCH TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT IT
Line_2709	GO ON ACCEPT DAMN IT

Line_2718	WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GOV'NOR
Line_2719	FOR A SECOND IZZY'S FACE WENT BLANK THEN HE CHUCKLED
Line_2720	YOU DIDN'T PAY UP YOUR PLEDGE TO THE CAMPAIGN FUND SO I HADDA FILL IN
Line_2721	HE PULLED OUT THE BILLS AND HANDED THEM OVER

Line_2723	THAT'S MARS GORDON ECHOED THE OTHER'S COMMENT WHY DON'T YOU PULL OFF THE PLANET FATS YOU COULD GO BACK TO EARTH I'D GUESS THE OTHER NODDED
Line_2724	HE GRABBED GORDON'S HAND AND WADDLED DOWN THE LANDING PLANK IZZY SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_2725	THERE WAS A GRIN ON THE OTHER'S FACE

Line_2736	WE SENT TWENTY OTHERS THE SAME WAY AND THEY FAILED
Line_2737	FATS PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
Line_2738	GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
Line_2739	CREDIT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AGAIN AND THE BUSINESSES WERE OPEN
Line_2740	I I OH DRAT IT I'M GETTING OLD IZZY YOU TELL HIM

Line_2777	BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
Line_2778	THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONEWALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
Line_2779	WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAYNE WILL BE RE ELECTED
Line_2780	THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
Line_2781	THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
Line_2782	NO THE COPS THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
Line_2783	THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
Line_2784	MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
Line_2785	THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON FELT
Line_2786	IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
Line_2787	HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
Line_2788	BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
Line_2789	TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON
Line_2790	THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
Line_2791	HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
Line_2792	FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
Line_2793	YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
Line_2794	BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
Line_2795	BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
Line_2796	THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
Line_2797	THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPS STARTED OFF
Line_2798	GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
Line_2799	SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
Line_2800	EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
Line_2801	AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
Line_2802	GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
Line_2803	BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAYNE WAS RE ELECTED
Line_2804	IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
Line_2805	THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
Line_2806	THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCH WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
Line_2807	THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
Line_2808	TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
Line_2809	WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
Line_2810	BUT NOW GO TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
Line_2811	SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFAL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DANDAN
Line_2812	WHY DIDST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS THY COMPANION
Line_2813	SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
Line_2814	THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRTHING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
Line_2815	SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STOKER GIRTHED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
Line_2816	AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR AL HIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
Line_2817	AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND NUZHAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
Line_2818	THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS
Line_2819	ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANT HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM HOW HE HAD FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
Line_2820	I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES ET ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
Line_2821	BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGHDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHALL BETIDE THEE

Line_2823	THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
Line_2824	AND ALSO THESE
Line_2825	THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN
Line_2826	ZAU AL MAKAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THIS POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
Line_2827	WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
Line_2828	WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
Line_2829	MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
Line_2830	SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
Line_2831	LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAU AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE SANS PEER
Line_2832	AFTER AWHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
Line_2833	KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAU AL MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
Line_2834	HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
Line_2835	AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
Line_2836	I SAY WHAT MADE MY IGNOMY WHATE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FRO ME THAT LAND TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WOULD DEAL ME SHAME
Line_2837	BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HIM
Line_2838	RETURN QUICKLY AND LINGER NOT
Line_2839	BUT SHE SAID WHOMSOEVER THOU SEEST AWAKE HE IS THE RECITER
Line_2840	THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAU AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
Line_2841	THEN THE EUNUCH WENT OUT TO ZAU AL MAKAN AND SAID TO HIM RECITE WHAT VERSES THOU KNOWEST FOR MY LADY IS HERE HARD BY LISTENING TO THEE AND AFTER I WILL ASK THEE OF THY NAME AND THY NATIVE COUNTRY AND THY CONDITION
Line_2842	WE WILL DO THEE NO UPRIGHT O MY SON NOR WRONG THEE IN AUGHT BUT OUR OBJECT IS THAT THOU BEND THY GRACIOUS STEPS WITH ME TO MY MISTRESS TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER AND RETURN IN WEAL AND SAFETY AND THOU SHALT HAVE A HANDSOME PRESENT AS ONE WHO BRINGETH GOOD NEWS

Line_2844	WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY THIRD NIGHT
Line_2845	BY ALLAH REPLIED THE FIREMAN I TELL THEE THE TRUTH
Line_2846	TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED QUOTH ZAU AL MAKAN
Line_2847	REPLIED HE OF A TRUTH I HEARD HIM NOT AND I WOT HIM NOT AND FOLKS ARE ALL SLEEPING
Line_2848	BUT TAKE THESE HUNDRED DINERS AND GIVE THEM TO THE SINGER AND BRING HIM TO ME GENTLY AND DO HIM NO HURT
Line_2849	REJOINED THE EUNUCH WHO THEN WAS THE RECITER POINT HIM OUT TO ME
Line_2850	NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAU AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT
Line_2851	THEN SAID THE EUNUCH ART THOU HE WHO REPEATED POETRY BUT NOW AND MY LADY HEARD HIM
Line_2852	HE WHO RECITED THE FIRST TIME HATH RECITED A SECOND TIME AND I HEARD HIM HARD BY
Line_2853	BY ALLAH AN THOU FETCH HIM NOT TO ME I WILL ASSUREDLY ROUSE THE CHAMBERLAIN ON THEE AND HE SHALL BEAT THEE AND CAST THEE OUT
Line_2854	THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED A ROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
Line_2855	AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISTICHS
Line_2856	WHAT AILS THEE THEN THAT THOU MUST NEEDS RECITE VERSES SEEING THAT WE ARE TIRED OUT WITH WALKING AND WATCHING AND ALL THE FOLK ARE ASLEEP FOR THEY REQUIRE SLEEP TO REST THEM OF THEIR FATIGUE
Line_2857	WHEN NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WHILOME HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED AT THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE
Line_2858	O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
Line_2859	THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
Line_2860	WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
Line_2861	LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDEAWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
Line_2862	STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN
Line_2863	LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CROWN
Line_2864	THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LEER IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
Line_2865	I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
Line_2866	THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
Line_2867	BRIGHT AND NATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF HIS CAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
Line_2868	CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDY NOW
Line_2869	OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
Line_2870	HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
Line_2871	LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WYLDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOG CART FOR MARK BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
Line_2872	OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL
Line_2873	BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
Line_2874	AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
Line_2875	A SLAVE ONLY THINK A SLAVE
Line_2876	IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
Line_2877	HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGOT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
Line_2878	RACHEL LAKE RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
Line_2879	HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2880	THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
Line_2881	SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
Line_2882	SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ORDER A BALLOT
Line_2883	THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTEE BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
Line_2884	AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
Line_2885	HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
Line_2886	VOTES PLEASE BEASTLY
Line_2887	ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
Line_2888	IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
Line_2889	LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
Line_2890	BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
Line_2891	TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
Line_2892	THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
Line_2893	THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
Line_2894	BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
Line_2895	WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
Line_2896	IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
Line_2897	HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
Line_2898	THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
Line_2899	LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
Line_2900	THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
Line_2901	TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
Line_2902	THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
Line_2903	A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
Line_2904	HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
Line_2905	SANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
Line_2906	HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
Line_2907	THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
Line_2908	WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
Line_2909	THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES
Line_2910	YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
Line_2911	LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
Line_2912	BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
Line_2913	WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
Line_2914	THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
Line_2915	I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
Line_2916	THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHTN'T TO DO
Line_2917	IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
Line_2918	HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
Line_2919	SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
Line_2920	WHY WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
Line_2921	OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
Line_2922	WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PARKS FOR TIMBER
Line_2923	LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
Line_2924	IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
Line_2925	OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
Line_2926	THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
Line_2927	AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
Line_2928	HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
Line_2929	THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
Line_2930	AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
Line_2931	THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
Line_2932	WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING
Line_2933	SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
Line_2934	YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
Line_2935	SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE
Line_2936	HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
Line_2937	TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
Line_2938	THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE'RE THE LANDOWNERS

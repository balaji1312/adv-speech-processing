Line_234	HE CANT SUCKOL HIM CENEY
Line_235	I DO NOT SUPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRIVILIAN
Line_236	IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSEL TO CARY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO CEPE IT AT HOME
Line_237	AND HE DID GOW AWAY LEAVING BOSLE STANDING IN THE MILE OF STONY WALK

Line_950	I DO NOT BELIVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OFE REALY HAPPEND I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRME THAT THESE SUPPOSED DMOCRASCIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFERENT ELLIMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING INCOMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT HEIR NAME
Line_951	I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARRISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
Line_952	IN ARISTOCRECIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOL OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PERSCUS BUT AMONGXST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTANCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEXE THIS SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYSE EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY HOLY FORON TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT KNOTIONS OF EACH
Line_953	THEN THERE ARERE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEAN CONSTANTLY OCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFAIRS OF THE GOVERMENT AND THOSEWHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMON WELTH ARE HOLLY ENGROSED BY THE ACQUASITION OF A PRIVATE FORTON
Line_954	THESE PERSONS THEN DESPLAYD TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURIL GELISSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRASIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMOALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIRE EAQUAL'S CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PEARAD OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSESION
Line_955	AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEASUR HOUR TO DANCE MERILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELOWS OF HIS COAWLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUH OUT THE GREATER PART OF YUROUP SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
Line_956	THEY STAND UN MOVED IN THEIR SOLLITARY GRATNESS WELL ASURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF ANDTHAT KNO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
Line_957	THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAINE A CALM SENCE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEAGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AD KNO ONE CONTESTS AND THEASE THINGS ARE NOT SUFICIENTLY KNEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
Line_958	IN ARRISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREATE POSESS IMENCSE PRIVLEAGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEKING TO RELYE UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ECRUSERDOM
Line_959	WHERE AN ARISTOCRASY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALY ASUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFERENT AND HOURTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
Line_960	IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE Y HER REPLIDSE THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
Line_961	IN ARRISTOCRATIC COMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BIRSTS OF TMOLTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAIETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES AND DEMOCRASIES ARE KNOT FOND OF BEING THUS VILENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND HEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGREATT

Line_1210	I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGTED IN AND REVERAENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDED TIPE A COMPOUND OF AL THAT IS BEST IN AGIPTION GRIK AND ATTALLIAN

Line_1865	ONELY I'L DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
Line_1866	THEN YOU DON'T KOW WHAT YORE TALKING ABOUT
Line_1867	HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
Line_1868	OVER THE FIR PLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASIONED GILT MIROR
Line_1869	BUT HEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
Line_1870	ON THE LAST SATTERDAY IN APRIL THE KNEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALLEXANDER'S KEW GERSY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEAR HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFIS ON WEST TENTH STRET
Line_1871	I'VE BEEN UP IN CANIDA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO KEW YORK UNTILL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
Line_1872	OF COURSE I KOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YO WON'T OW ME THE LIEAST CONSCIDERATION BUT WE SALE ON TSDAY
Line_1873	OH BARTLY DID YOU RIGHT TO ME
Line_1874	I SAW THAT INTERVIW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO S YOU THATS ALL GOD NIGHT IM GOING NOW
Line_1875	ALLEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
Line_1876	HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROM QUICKLY
Line_1877	LET ME TAKE OF YOUR COATE AND YOUR BOTS THEIRE OSING WATER
Line_1878	I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
Line_1879	I THINK I HADE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
Line_1880	IN THEIR IYES GESUS OF NASEORITH WAS A MEARE MORTAL THE LAGITTIMATE SON OF GOSIF AND MEARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTROMENTS TO RESTORE UPON ERTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DETY
Line_1881	YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BN TERIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS A POLINARISS WAS HEARD TO MUTER IN SOME FAINT ACENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLINATION
Line_1882	NORE COULD IT SEME STRANGE OR INCREADIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE EONS  THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EIRTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
Line_1883	THE SONE OF A VERGIAN GENERATED BY THE INEPFIABLE OPORATION OFTHE HOLLY SPIRITE WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXSAMPLE OR RESEMBLENCE SUPERIORE IN EVERY ATRBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
Line_1884	THEIR MURMORS WERE VEARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTORIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SISTOM OF CARIENTHIS
Line_1885	HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN CKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRTIS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIDGION AND JUSTIS AND AL THOUGH THE STOWICK OR THE HEROW MAY DISTAINE THE HUMBLE VIRTUS OF JESS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHEAD OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEAMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
Line_1886	HE ACQUEESED IN THE OLD DESTINCTION OF THE GREK FHILOSOFER S BETWEN THE RATIONAL AND SENCITIVE SOLL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOAWGOS FOR INTILECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPALE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
Line_1887	A LAUDBLE REGARD FOR THE ONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELIGHTE HAS COUNTEINANCED THE BELIEFE THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIANIGHTS OR AT LEAST THE NASORINS WERE DESTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICS OF THE MOSAYIC RIGHTS
Line_1888	WHEN THE MESIA WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS F THE GJES THE CRIST AND IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FOR SOK HIS ERTHLY TABERNACAL FLEW BACK TO THE PLARMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLLITARY GESES TO SUFFER TO COMPLAINE AND TO EXPIRE
Line_1889	UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABIT SERAPIAN HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATICABLE ARDER THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PORUSED THE FOUR GOSPALES THE CATHOLIC APPISSTALES AND THEOPPITLE TO THE ROMANS
Line_1890	THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHENASIS THE WORTHY ANTAGANIST OF GJULIAN HE BRAVELY RESSLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLITHIEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGUR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALGORICAL SENCE OF THESCRIPTURES
Line_1891	THEIR CHERCHES HAVE DISSPPEARED TEIR BOKS ARE OBLITTERATED THEIRE OBSCURE FREDOM MIGHT ALOW A LATTITUDE OF FATH AND THE SOTNESS OF THEIR INFINT CREED WOULD BE VERIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE SEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THRE HUNDRAD YEARS
Line_1892	BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCASIONAL ALYIEANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WESIL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANCIAL INDESCOIABLE AND EVERLASTING YUNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOL AND HUMAN FLESH
Line_1893	MANY AMONG THE GENTIL PROSELIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A SELESTIAL SPIRIT AND UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEN PERSIONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR SEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY OBDURED THE HUMANITY OF CRIST
Line_1894	YET THE MOST CHARITIBLE CRITISISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTORIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPPAR DIVINITY OF CRIST
Line_1895	HIS PROGRESS FROM INFENCY TO YOTH AND MANHOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCRECE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXSPIRED ON THE CROSS
Line_1896	BUT THE JUSTIESS AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INOCENT MARTER AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFAINE
Line_1897	A PFEDIST THAT COULD INCRECE FROM AN INVISBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAINE THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOD WITHOUT DIRIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SORSES MIGHT CONTINOUW TO EXIST WITHOUT REPARING A DAILY WAST BY A DAILY SUPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
Line_1898	BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRIN OF THE ATTURNITY AND ENHARENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHUERCHES OF THE EAST
Line_1899	HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDEN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPTAENTE TO IMITATE THE FACOLTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ELUSION ON THE SENCES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
Line_1900	BUT THE RASHNESS OFTHESE CONCESIONS HAS ENCURADGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSETS WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CRIST WAS A FANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASIBLE AND INCORUPTABLE BODY
Line_1901	WRETURNE TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAD YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUS REPARE THE MISCHIF AND SCANDL OF YOUR MEATING
Line_1902	WITHOUT ANY LEAGAL SENTANCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATERIARKE AT THE DOUHNE OF THE DAY LED A CIDITCIOUS MOLTITUDE TO THE ATACK OF THE CINNEGOGS
Line_1903	BUT THE VATICON RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSONGERS OF EAGIPT
Line_1904	A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMIS OR KNUBIANS INVATED HIS SOLLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETRETE THEY DISMISED A CROUD OF YOUSELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SNER HAD MISTURIOUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NIL THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AN ORTHEDOCS CITTY TO THE MILD OR SERVITUDE OFTHE SAVAGES

Line_1908	SIXTY AIGHT BISHOUPS TWENTY TWO OF METRAPOLITIN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODUST AND TEMPARATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNTCILES OF THEIR BRETHERIN

Line_1911	AT THESE BLASTFOMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLERS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
Line_1912	BY THE VIGULENCE OF MEMBNONE THE CHERCHES WERE SHOT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHIADRAL
Line_1913	ARDANT IN THE PRSECUTION OF HERISY CARIL OSPITIOUSLY OPENED HIS RAINE BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIONS THE MOST INOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTORIES

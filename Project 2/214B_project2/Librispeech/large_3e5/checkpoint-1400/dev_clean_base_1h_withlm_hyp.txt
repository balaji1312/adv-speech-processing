Line_179	WHAT IS IT CORELY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
Line_180	SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
Line_181	HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROTSKIN
Line_182	DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALISE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
Line_183	THERE IS NOTHING MAGJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
Line_184	THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALIS
Line_185	THEREFORE I AM A MER AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GARD THE WELLFAIR OF MY SUBJECTS
Line_186	SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTENBRIGHTS OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CATENBILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
Line_187	NOW OUR WAY IS BEST
Line_188	THEY SEEM VERY IGNOURENT POR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
Line_189	THESE INTRUDEORS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROUD

Line_196	YET THE PHYSIOGNMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXIBITING THE INDIFFERAENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MANERVA
Line_197	IT HAD BEEN BILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASILS WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCTECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESINING A DOMESTIC RESIDENTS
Line_198	IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOWS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VOLTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLY
Line_199	IT WAS ABOUT NON WHEN CAPTIN WAIVERLY ENTERED THE STRAGLING VILLADGE OR BRATHER HAMOLET OF TULEY VAL NE CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETER
Line_200	NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
Line_201	THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
Line_202	THIS AVINOW WAS STRATE AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE RO A VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESNOUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SICOMORS WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HITS AND NURISHED SO LUURIANTELY THAT THEIR BOWS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROADE BENEATH
Line_203	THE COURT WAS PACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITER

Line_206	THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN ACCOUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
Line_207	STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
Line_208	AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAGIESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOR
Line_209	MISSUS BOSELE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BISNESS WAS BISNESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BISNESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
Line_210	DOS ONE MISTER SAMIOUL BOSELE LIVE HERE ASKED TRAVILIOAN
Line_211	BUT TRIVILLION WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISCUSTED AND REVULTED MOST UN REASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTERS DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
Line_212	THE PATURNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFENTS NO DOUT THAT WAS BOSELE'S LAW
Line_213	IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBARA SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OF WITH HIM TO NAPOLES
Line_214	OF COURSE IT ANT SAID MISSOUS BAL
Line_215	ITS THAT MAKES HIM AND I WON'T SAY WHAT
Line_216	HE IS UP IN OWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLAMENTORY DUTIES
Line_217	A DISTINCT PROMISS OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRIVILLIAN ON TRIVILIAN'S ARRIVALE IN ENGLAND
Line_218	THEN BASE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
Line_219	AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFLING GATE AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
Line_220	I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BE EXCLAIMED MISSUS BASELE ITS MY BELIEFE AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSOUS BASELE TUTCHED HER FOREHEAD
Line_221	PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TRIVILLION
Line_222	BASELE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOS
Line_223	AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBONDS EXERTIONS SHE WOLD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LOYIORS
Line_224	AND ALL WORK HAD SEED WITH HIM
Line_225	WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWARS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE RONG SIDE OF THE POST TO OR IT AIN'T PROVED GA HIM THAT HE DO THE NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
Line_226	IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME SEAL
Line_227	AND BASE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
Line_228	DR THEM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
Line_229	BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD BE
Line_230	TRIVILLIAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN I WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIMEMINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIMEMINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
Line_231	I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
Line_232	IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SCKINT SIR SUGGESTED BASEL
Line_233	MISSUS BEL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAM T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADIES LOVER
Line_234	HE CAN'T SUCK HIM KEY
Line_235	I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRIVILIAN
Line_236	IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSEL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
Line_237	AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOSLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
Line_238	AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOL REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMIUAL BOSELE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
Line_239	BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEVEBEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
Line_240	BOSELE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BISNESS WITH HIS COAT BUTENED OVER HIS BREST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
Line_241	ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISTION BY OBAYING ME A SECOND TIME TODAY

Line_244	DORA FORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED

Line_736	ONE OF THE YOUNG FEARIES OVER HEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HOLE SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FARIY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
Line_737	IT IS TRUE I CAN NOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
Line_738	THE TURN OF THE OLD FARY HAD KNOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALIS BUT THE PRINCE SHOULD PEARSE HER HAND WITH A SPINDL AND DYE OF THE WOUND
Line_739	SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDL THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PEARSED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
Line_740	BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROASY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WIN LEFT
Line_741	HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTL BUT BEHOLD

Line_745	BUT MEN CEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POARING DOWN AND THE S WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
Line_746	SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DUCALION
Line_747	WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID UKALIAN TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITH OUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
Line_748	WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PITRO
Line_749	IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DUCALIAN AND HE WAS THE SON OF PORMITHIUS
Line_750	THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SORE OF TROUBLE
Line_751	NO ONE BUT TOUCALIAN THE SON OF PROMITHIOUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
Line_752	IS THERE ANY THING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
Line_753	GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOLDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
Line_754	BUT DUCALIAN AND PIRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
Line_755	WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL LEAR TO SERVE THEM
Line_756	THEY PERSADED ELLEQUENTLY
Line_757	I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
Line_758	BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLLED PROBLOM
Line_759	HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
Line_760	RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARDS A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMORAD HAD FALLEN IN IT
Line_761	HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLOW BOYS WHAT IS IT BS

Line_770	WE HAD BEAF FOR SUPER THAT NIGHT
Line_771	A YANKE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
Line_772	WE SAW THE UNITED STATS FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE A SLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
Line_773	THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT GIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LOW THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
Line_774	A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS GIMS REGIMENT
Line_775	A MAN IN THE WELL
Line_776	WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COST WAS CLEAR
Line_777	HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLASED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN HEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
Line_778	YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
Line_779	WE PASSED AROUND ATLANA CROSSED THE CHATHOUCHI AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME RUT ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARGUS CAMPAINE UNDER GOE JONSON
Line_780	WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENS SIDE OF TENS RIVER
Line_781	HOW EVERY PULSE D BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY A KIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLGENCE OF OUR ON WARD MARCH TOWARDS THE LAND OF PROMIS AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
Line_782	WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BROAD CHETOM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
Line_783	I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOLDER
Line_784	AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVER TOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
Line_785	THE YANKES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
Line_786	BUT IT COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MAN'S SHOES
Line_787	BAD GENERAL SHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CRISMOUS
Line_788	I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
Line_789	BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKIES PPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
Line_790	HE DEVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MIST ITS AM
Line_791	WE WE NOT TWENTY YARDS OF FROM THE YANKIES AND HEY WERE PORING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN SEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN

Line_793	THE FETDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHFVILL THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
Line_794	HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GRONE
Line_795	THE LEAN HAIL STORM SWEPD THEM OF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REFORMED
Line_796	I CALL LOTENANT CURNAL FRIRSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKIES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKIES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME IN OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
Line_797	I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABED AT MY GUN
Line_798	OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED THE NIGHT ATTACK
Line_799	I THINK WE MUST HVE KID A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
Line_800	I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONCIBILITY RESTING ON ME
Line_801	MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
Line_802	HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED AT FOOT QUICK
Line_803	OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MERFERES BURROW
Line_804	THE PRIVAT GOOD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
Line_805	OKLY COLARBAROR OF THE FOURTH TENS REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDSTE OF THE ANY LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
Line_806	WE CEPT FALLING BACK AND WE FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
Line_807	WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKY LINE ON THE WILCARSON TURN PIPE
Line_808	WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
Line_809	WE REMANED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
Line_810	I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND E WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS CONTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
Line_811	I LOKD AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOOD
Line_812	FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGUMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICK DUTY
Line_813	THE YANKY PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OF
Line_814	LINE OF BAL WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKY SIDE
Line_815	SHI LOW
Line_816	ON MONDAY MORNING I TO CAPTURED ME A MEUL
Line_817	IT WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONSET
Line_818	I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MEAL AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS KNOW
Line_819	THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BAL IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
Line_820	THE FACT WAS CEPTD FROM THE TROPS
Line_821	ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMORS BREAD RELIEVED GLADENS
Line_822	ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOKS BUT YOU ARE A LIL TO SMART
Line_823	THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENS GIVE AM A HALL COLUMBIA
Line_824	ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
Line_825	OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEAN TO KEEP IN LINE
Line_826	THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULS KNOW AND HE WAS FINLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROAP TO CROSS THE CREEK
Line_827	WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
Line_828	ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
Line_829	I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIEALDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIEALDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STRONE WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
Line_830	SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROAP TID ONE END AROUND THE MEUL'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CASE ON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
Line_831	SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFR YOU TO HISTORY
Line_832	I DID NOT PRETEND TO TELL IN WHAT COMAND DESTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROS OF BLOOD AND WONDS OF SHREKS AND GRONS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANON CAPTURED AT CETERA
Line_833	WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALIBAMA BRGADE
Line_834	MEULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
Line_835	ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPFED OF DRAGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEORATE LINES
Line_836	BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN OUTOMTONE AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
Line_837	AS GLADN ROAD BY US A CURIER ROAT UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
Line_838	I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHIP BUT WHEN THEY ORDER D CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
Line_839	A THOUSAND PLANES WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
Line_840	BUT EACH WEAK ADDED TO HIS LONLINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR METAL AND HIS FORISTS
Line_841	SPRING CAME IN PASS AND THEN SUMMER
Line_842	THREE DAYS LATER MINETALKY BECAME NUSON'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
Line_843	ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOLD MEAT ROD AT SPROUSEWOD ON THE BLACK STERGIAN RIVER
Line_844	NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER IN THE FOLLOWING WEAK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
Line_845	ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WILBIGAND'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE OBDUCTION OF THE PRINCES
Line_846	CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABY RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOR FATHERS WHILE MINATALKY AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELYNESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WELTH OF SOFT GET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK YES CONTRASTING WITH THE LITER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
Line_847	WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
Line_848	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND KNEUSOM INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINTAKY
Line_849	THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S ES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
Line_850	WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCOP TAKEN
Line_851	ONE OF NEUSOMS CHIF PLEASURS IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDJUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINTOKE AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
Line_852	A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOUNGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
Line_853	BUT THIS POWER OF DESCTERNMENT WAS DENID THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRSIDS CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
Line_854	WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN INTO CROYT IN THREE YEARS
Line_855	CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHE AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EJUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTORY SCOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN POR ARTHER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROULY EQUIPED SCOLS
Line_856	BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABY WENT BACK TO THE PRINCES MOTHER TO MINETAKEY AND TO HIS FORISTS
Line_857	FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OFTHE MOST SANGUINARY FUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FED WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
Line_858	WABY ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCOSENS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWORTHY SINUY AND AGILE AS A LINK AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
Line_859	THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPORATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECET OF WABY'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WORL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
Line_860	MEAN WHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY YUNIAN OF KNUSOM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
Line_861	THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALY BRIGHT PUPLES AND BY THE TIME WABY WAS SIXTEEN AND MINTOKY TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MAR OF SPEACH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VAINS
Line_862	IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME I THEIR LIVES THAT THE WUNGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPRIDATIONS
Line_863	THREE WEEKS LATER CAME L BIGOHONSORPLY
Line_864	AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINTIAL GOVERMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST KNOTORIOUS FOLOWERS
Line_865	MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
Line_866	HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISILATED FARM SOME SOLLITARY BUR OR ISLANDCOUSE BIT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGERS ON THE HI WAY OF LIFE
Line_867	I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS KNOW AN THEN TUTCHNG THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FED SENTAR
Line_868	A FEW STRAKE HOWS AND SHIP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
Line_869	SNOW TEMPESTD IMPRACTICABLE RODS ROCKS ICEBIRGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
Line_870	I SHOULD HAVE A VILENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXURSISE
Line_871	HANDS OUREXTRORDINARY GIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVERYING STEP
Line_872	HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
Line_873	I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDNER WAS TO BE FOUND
Line_874	BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO WATE
Line_875	I THOROLY UNDERSTOOD AND PPRICIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FORDFORE THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEE AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
Line_876	THESE SACRED ETTIFISES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
Line_877	LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTICLE WHICH AWATED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNIFFLES WHERE AGLARMORATIONS OF NATOURES RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CAYIOSS
Line_878	TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME OBSRD
Line_879	WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POR AND SPARE MEDOWS WHICH MADE A DESPRAT EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
Line_880	IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELIGENCE THAN THEIRS
Line_881	WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GIDE
Line_882	I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXILLIRATING DELIGHTE OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
Line_883	THEY VERY RARELY SUCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
Line_884	OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITH OUT REQUIRING WIP OR SPUR
Line_885	GEOGROFORS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH WEST QUORTER WHICH IN THE VENACULAR IS CALLD SUDVESTE FORTINGER
Line_886	IT CONSIST SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
Line_887	AT LENGTH THE STIRTY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARAT STONE LIKE THE COLOSSIS OF RODS
Line_888	ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG ORS OF THE BOAT MEAN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCALMOTION
Line_889	THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOME HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
Line_890	THEN WITHOUT FIRTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWATED US
Line_891	ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BORD THE GOOD SHIPS VULCORY
Line_892	THE FACT IS THE CASTAL IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROICE PRINCE OF DE MARK
Line_893	ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SITED APE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MIDRILS YOAKL WHICH THE WETHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
Line_894	WHEN THEREFORE HE ADRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORIS WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
Line_895	NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
Line_896	HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A SIVLE SERVANT A MAGISTRET THE GOVERNOR OF THE ILAND BARON TRAMP
Line_897	MY UNCLE WAS DELIGTED FOR MYSELF MY AND DISATISFIED I PPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GOAST OF HAMLET
Line_898	THE VULCARY CREPTD OF THE COST STARING TO THE WEST WARD
Line_899	I HAVE NOT THE SLIGTEST DOUT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS READ TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANOYENCEOF THE PASTER AND CONGREGATION
Line_900	THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
Line_901	NOW HEARY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS ON GOS WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
Line_902	BUT NO GOST OR ANYTHING ELSE PPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
Line_903	THE FACT WAS THAT SCARSLY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICALE VESSLE
Line_904	WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
Line_905	ON ALL SIDS WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCOLS OF WALLS AND SHARKS
Line_906	NO MISTER HARD WIG SAID THE CAPTIN NO FEAR OF THAT
Line_907	VERY LIKELY I MIGHT FIND THERE SOME MANOUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SUCNUSM
Line_908	THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HARED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MEAN EXILES OF A HIR SCALE IN THE LATER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESCMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
Line_909	THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR SENTURIES
Line_910	IN THE MEAN TIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
Line_911	I SAW BUT FEW INHABITENTS DURING MY EXCERSION BUT I MET A CROUD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODE FISH THE PRINCIPALE ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
Line_912	I SH BE GLAD TO CONSULTE THEM
Line_913	THIS MODESTSCOLLOR SPOKE NO LANGUEGES SAVE ICELANDICK AND LATIN
Line_914	THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS IN THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY

Line_920	I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SOTA AND A BAG OF POP CORN WITHIN EASY REACH
Line_921	SOME HOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE IS IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHACES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE S NOT BIRDY SLEEPING
Line_922	YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANY WAY

Line_941	ITS THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
Line_942	WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHULD TURNAGISED TEBY PROGRAM OF IN THE MIDDLE WITH OUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
Line_943	I HAFE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
Line_944	PUMP GOES RIGHT ON TING HIS CHANNEL
Line_945	I LOOK AT MY WATCH ITS A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
Line_946	THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIANT O THE SMALLEST SENTURE AND INSACIABLE OF PRAYS
Line_947	IF I APPLOAWD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITENTS ENJOY HE ANSERS FREDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
Line_948	CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICAN'S IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
Line_949	THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMUNITIES
Line_950	I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRME THAT THESE SUPPOSED DIMOCRASCIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELLIMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LETTER EXCEPT HEIR NAME
Line_951	I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARRISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
Line_952	IN ARRISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOL OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PERS BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTANCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THIS SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY HOLY FORON TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT KNOTIONS OF EACH
Line_953	THEN THERE ARERE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEAN CONSTANTLY OCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFAIRS OF THE GOVERMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON WELTH ARE HOY ENGROSED BY THE ACQUASITION OF A PRIVATE FORTON
Line_954	THESE PERSONS THEN DESPLAYD TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PURIL GELISSIES WHICH ANIMATED THE MEAN OF DEMOCRASIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIRE EAQUAL'S CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PERAD OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSESION
Line_955	AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEASURE OUR TO DANCE MERILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESULT AS THE FELOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUED TO DO THROUH OUT THE GREATER PART OF YUROUP SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
Line_956	THEY STAND UN MOVED IN THEIR SOLLITARY GRATNESS WELL ASURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF ANDTHAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
Line_957	THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAINE A CALM SEN OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEAGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEVES A NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
Line_958	IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSES IMMENSE PRIVLEAGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEKING TO RELYE UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ECRUSERDOM
Line_959	WHERE AN ARISTOCRASY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFERENT AND HOURTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
Line_960	IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE Y HER REPLIDSE THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
Line_961	IN ARISTOCRATIC COMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BIRSTS OF TMOLTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAITY WHICH SHAKE OF AT ONCE THE RECOLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES AND DEMOCRASIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VILENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND HEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
Line_962	MY GRAND MOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TON OF FORENERS AS IF THEY WERE DEATH
Line_963	THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN CAKES AND SORGAM MALASSS FOR THREE DAYS
Line_964	HER SKIN WAS BROWN TWO AND IN HER CHEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
Line_965	IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRETS I REMEMBER IN VERGINIA
Line_966	SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAR
Line_967	WHEN I CAME UP HE TUTCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
Line_968	EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
Line_969	NOW WHY IS THAT AUTO
Line_970	WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
Line_971	WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RIVEN LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BOSHES THAT GROW BELOW US
Line_972	OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG BUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODING IN TIME TO HIS BIGHTS AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARDS THEM
Line_973	AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE WHO IN THE BANK
Line_974	VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED
Line_975	SHE GOT UP ON HER NEES AND RUNG HER HANDS

Line_1207	BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
Line_1208	IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND CALLED VILENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME INSPIGHT OF MANIFESTD EFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
Line_1209	IN ABOUT FOR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GIDS MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INCLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
Line_1210	I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGTED IN AND REVERANCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDED TIP A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN AGIPTION GRIK AND ATTALLIAN
Line_1211	EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROTH OF SHOPLITS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGITATED SOME HOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEKEST
Line_1212	HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MAR
Line_1213	EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMLY AND THE OLD GREAT HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAGESTY OF THEIR OWN
Line_1214	THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVILESSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
Line_1215	THE VINE GROW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SINDBORDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FELL MUCH AT HOME
Line_1216	THE MEAN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WIMAN BEAUTIFUL
Line_1217	THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY COULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
Line_1218	WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THEREWERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
Line_1219	THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TON THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPORATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIF AND KNODED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TON QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
Line_1220	AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARAGE WHOSE WALLS INSPIGHT OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESINED ORIGINALLY FOR IURN RAILS
Line_1221	THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
Line_1222	THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
Line_1223	THE CHILDREN WERE INFINEATE IN NUMBER AND EXCEDINGLY MARRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
Line_1224	THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE IRTHLY
Line_1225	EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED ILIDS ILASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVERIBLY PERFECT
Line_1226	MY GIDS HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLIHTNESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIANCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP YING ME NOR THEM
Line_1227	SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPPLES WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DIS LIKE
Line_1228	I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMORATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GIDS AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
Line_1229	I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
Line_1230	THE DESINE WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
Line_1231	SURFICED THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
Line_1232	ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER

Line_1234	I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVERABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALMAL GASET OF APRIL TWELFH AND THE SECOND IND THE SPECTATER OF APRIL TWENTIETH
Line_1235	THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS

Line_1237	I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF ROW THAT WERE REPEATEDLYRERITEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COOD
Line_1238	THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS INSPIHT OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
Line_1239	I ALSO ROAT ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ALTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRILE OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMTION
Line_1240	PRES TO THE SECOND ADDITION

Line_1245	THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAS
Line_1246	BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF RECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
Line_1247	I SEE FOR MY SECOND PREFIS THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MISURS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS OPTAINED THE HIEST RANK AMONG LIVING RIHTERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNAR EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
Line_1248	I REGRET THAT REVIUWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TRET THE CHAPTERS ON MASHENS AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN OBSERDITY

Line_1504	HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY

Line_1506	HE WAS IN A FEAVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFES ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
Line_1507	HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANY HOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW

Line_1511	HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
Line_1512	HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAJERIAL POSITION
Line_1513	FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE AUNVLOPS HAD BEEN SAND AND NOTHING SUSPIIOUS KNOTISED

Line_1617	THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
Line_1618	AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASCONING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND

Line_1626	WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARRY AN SHE ROAT AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HUNYMON IN HER COTTEAGE OR PIGSTY AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
Line_1627	HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
Line_1628	AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
Line_1629	HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR GERNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COPANDS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTELL ITS A WEADING PRESENT
Line_1630	SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
Line_1631	IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
Line_1632	I HAVE DROWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO AUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY AUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FOLT IF I DON'T GET IT
Line_1633	A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH AND I WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
Line_1634	HERS HAS BEEN PRODIDGIOUS
Line_1635	WE GOING FOR OUR HUNEYMON TO ITTOLY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
Line_1636	THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
Line_1637	SHE HAS A NACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULIS
Line_1638	OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH HOME YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MAR OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
Line_1639	A SECOND COSON OF MARRYANS IS IN THE COOKS TORS LINE
Line_1640	I KNOW WHAT MAMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES IT
Line_1641	BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SE THE COPONDS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T YOSE
Line_1642	THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIYANA WEDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RENCORAS SCIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
Line_1643	WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARRY AND PRESENCE AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WIDING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TO
Line_1644	BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
Line_1645	I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE ITHER NEXT WEAK OR THE WEAK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE ERLYEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOUDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARRY ANDS THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
Line_1646	THE GIRL IS FREADING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
Line_1647	I SHALL MAKE POPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
Line_1648	I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
Line_1649	AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SCHERKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS ITHER
Line_1650	FROM A COUSON OF OURS WHO IS IN THAT LINE
Line_1651	I CAN NOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOUCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
Line_1652	IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPITION SPRINGS
Line_1653	I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSON GOT A PROFHET OUT OF MERYAN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HAND OVER THE AMOUNT
Line_1654	AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MICK PERSON HAS MERIAN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
Line_1655	IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFTORBLLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
Line_1656	THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION ACCRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
Line_1657	THAT WAS WHAT MISSOUS MICK PERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
Line_1658	I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINDS
Line_1659	THERE SHE ONES A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTIE FOR ALINO
Line_1660	THERE WERE NO SINS OF FOLTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
Line_1661	AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
Line_1662	BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
Line_1663	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
Line_1664	PEES THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEADING
Line_1665	I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BISNESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
Line_1666	I RUBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
Line_1667	HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
Line_1668	NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
Line_1669	TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTOURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OVE
Line_1670	AS FOR THE UCORIST TRAND SUBSTANCIATION THE REAL PRESENTS IT WAS ALL NO MISTORY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENTS AND YET THEY WERE NOT GESOITS
Line_1671	WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
Line_1672	BESIDS I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECTATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL FENOMANA THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELECT CAN NOT UNDERSTAND
Line_1673	THERE WAS NO COURDLY TRATOR AMONGST US ALL THOUGH WE WERE ALL POR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTOURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
Line_1674	I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GANDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
Line_1675	THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODUST SILENCE
Line_1676	YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHE YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GANDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
Line_1677	IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENCE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSER
Line_1678	WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
Line_1679	UN WILLING TO HERT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSESED A CERTAIN NEUMORAL CALCULIST WHICH GAVE ANSERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKE TO PUT
Line_1680	I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEME NOR CONCIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LA ING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECLESIASTICK AND AS AN OFFISOR IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HI YEST SOCIETY
Line_1681	THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CRISTIONS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHERCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTIES AND FULL OF SCROPLES
Line_1682	BUT ALL THOUGH BELIVING FULLY IN MY ORICLES THEY WERE TO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVLE AND IT STED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSORS INSPIRED BY SOME HEVONLY SPIRIT
Line_1683	I OBAYID IMPLICITELY AND MEAT YOUR EXCLENCSY
Line_1684	YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISOR IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
Line_1685	HE INTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
Line_1686	BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHAT EVER IT MIGHT BE AUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POR PAY OF AN OFFISOR WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFIIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WONTS THAN THOSE OF OFFISORS AND GENERAL
Line_1687	HE ROAT THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COLD NOT UNDERSTAND ITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSER
Line_1688	THE WATER OF THE MAGASIENO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DO ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENLTY OF DEATH
Line_1689	YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DEACEN'T WAY
Line_1690	I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HIPOCRESY AND I SHOULD HAVEBEEN DISPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOLDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIONC
Line_1691	AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN OUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPARED TO THE TWO SORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
Line_1692	MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BAD US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FATH
Line_1693	WE WOULD VERY OFTON SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY IN VENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXCECUTION THE MOST IMPERTAINATE PRACTICAL JOKES
Line_1694	IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PERISHES OF THE CITY OF VENUS THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGASINOW
Line_1695	THE POSITION WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TER HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY OPPLYING A MEURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ON RAISED ANY OBJECTION
Line_1696	THEY ALL ASK ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE ROLLS OF MY SUBLIME CALCULISTS
Line_1697	WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
Line_1698	I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISH TO FOLLOW THE RULS OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT ITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTEMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
Line_1699	WITH AN EJUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONORABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME ENTELEGENCE WHICH GOOD LITERARY AND SIENTIPIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRATY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
Line_1700	I JUMPED OUT OF THE GANDOLLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RISETA SUCH A FORSIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SIRGION AT THE FIRST COPY HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
Line_1701	THEY BELIEVE THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSESSED THE FILOSOFRSTON THE UNIVERSAL PANCIA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELLIMENTORY HEVENLY AND INFIRNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUT WHATEVER THAT THAN TO MY SUBLIME SINCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERMENT IN YUROUP
Line_1702	DELITED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
Line_1703	WE DID THE SAME WITH PISITIONS HOME WE OFTON SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME KNOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCOLENT HEALTH
Line_1704	I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRASEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE

Line_1710	TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHSITION WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLOOD AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
Line_1711	I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
Line_1712	I THROW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ESURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
Line_1713	THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
Line_1714	WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHIERCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FOUND TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PEARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELLROPS SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHIRCH WORDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS

Line_1842	SOMETHING OF THEIR CHUBLING SWETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TWO
Line_1843	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_1844	ITS UNBERABLE IT TORCURES ME EVERY MITE
Line_1845	AFTER THE VERY FIRST
Line_1846	ITS GOT TO BE A CLEAN BRAKE HILLDA
Line_1847	I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOME THING
Line_1848	HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
Line_1849	WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
Line_1850	SHE MERELY BROUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY END JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
Line_1851	HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER CEMBLING AND SCARSLY BRETHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER YES
Line_1852	IMERGING AT OSTERN AT HALF PAST THREE CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALLEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORDS SQUAIR
Line_1853	SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
Line_1854	A COLLE FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GREAT AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
Line_1855	SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
Line_1856	I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
Line_1857	AND I SHE WISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FALLING THAT
Line_1858	I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LUNDON
Line_1859	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOULD BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AR'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
Line_1860	IF YOULD SEND ME A KNOT OR TELLIFONE TO ME OR ANYTHING
Line_1861	THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
Line_1862	ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
Line_1863	YES I KNOW VERY WELL
Line_1864	HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
Line_1865	ONLY I DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
Line_1866	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YORE TALKING ABOUT
Line_1867	HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
Line_1868	OVER THE FIRE PLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASIONED GILT MIRROR
Line_1869	BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
Line_1870	ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALLEXANDER'S KNEW GERSY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
Line_1871	I'VE BEEN UP IN CANIDA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
Line_1872	OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OW ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAL ON TOSDAY
Line_1873	OH BARTLY DID YOU RIGHT TO ME
Line_1874	I SAW THAT INTERVIW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO S YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT IM GOING NOW
Line_1875	ALLEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
Line_1876	HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
Line_1877	LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOTS THERE OSING WATER
Line_1878	I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
Line_1879	I THINK I HAD FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
Line_1880	IN THEIR YES JESUS OF NASEORITH WAS A MER MORTAL THE LAGITTIMATE SON OF GOSIF AND MARRY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTROMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEATY
Line_1881	YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF HIS OWN RASHNESS A POLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTER IN SOME FAINT ACENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLINATION
Line_1882	NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE ONES THE LOGS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERRR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
Line_1883	THE SON OF A VERGIAN GENERATED BY THE INEPIABLE OPPORATION OFTHE HOLLY SPIRITE WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLENCE SUPERIORE IN EVERY ATRBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
Line_1884	THEIR MURMORS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTORIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SISTOM OF CARENTHIS
Line_1885	HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN KIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRTIES HAD LIKE WISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIDGION AND JUSTIS AND ALL THOUGH THE STOWICK OR THE HEROW MAY DISTAINE THE HUMBLE VEIRTUS OF JESS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHEAD OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEAMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
Line_1886	HE ACQUEESED IN THE OLD DESTINCTION OF THE GREK FHILOSSOFER S BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENCITIVE SOL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LAWGOS FOR INTILECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPALE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
Line_1887	A LAUDIBLE REGARD FOR THE ONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELIGHTE HAS COUNTINCED THE BELIEFE THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIANIGHTS OR AT LEAST THE NASORINS WERE DESTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAYIC RIGHTS
Line_1888	WHEN THE MESSIA WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS F THE GEES THE CRIST AND IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FOR SOOK HIS ERTHLY TABERNACAL FLEW BACK TO THE PLARMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLLITARY JESS TO SUPER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
Line_1889	UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABIT SERAPIAN HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATICABLE ARDER THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PORUSED THE FOUR GOSPALES THE CATHOLIC APPISTALES AND THE PILE TO THE ROMANS
Line_1890	THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHENASIS THE WORTHY ANTAGANIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY RESSLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLITHIEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGUR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMENTARIES REVELED THE LITERAL AND ALGORICAL SENCE OF THE SCRIPTURES
Line_1891	THEIR CHERCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FATH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFINT CREED WOULD BE VERIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE SEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
Line_1892	BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALYIEANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WEASEL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANCAL INDESCOLIABLE AND EVERLASTING YOUNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOL AND HUMAN FLESH
Line_1893	MANY AMONG THE GENTIL PROSELIGHTS REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A SELESTIAL SPIRIT AND UNDEVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR SEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY OBDURED THE HUMANITY OF CRIST
Line_1894	YET THE MOST CHARITIBLE CRITISISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTORIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CRIST
Line_1895	HIS PROGRESS FROM INFENCY TO YOTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCRECE IN STATUE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
Line_1896	BUT THE JUSTIESS AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FAT OF AN INOCENT MARTER AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFAINE
Line_1897	A FIST THAT COULD INCRECE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAINE THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOD WITHOUT DRIVING ANY NURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SORSES MIGHT CONTINU TO EXIST WITHOUT REPARING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
Line_1898	BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRIN OF THE ATTURNITY AND INHARENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
Line_1899	HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDEN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPTAENTE TO IMITATE THE FACOLTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ELUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
Line_1900	BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESIONS HAS ENCURADGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOSETS WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CRIST WAS A FANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASIBLE AND INCORUPTABLE BODY
Line_1901	RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAD YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUS REPAIR THE MISCHIF AND SCANDL OF YOUR MEETING
Line_1902	WITHOUT ANY LEAGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATERIARKE AT THE DONE OF THE DAY LEAD A CIDITCIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SINGS
Line_1903	BUT THE VATICON RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSONGERS OF EAGIPT
Line_1904	A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMIS OR KNUBIANS INVATED HIS SOLLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETRETE THEY DISMISED A CROWD OF YOUSELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD MISTURIOUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NIL THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AN ORTHEDOCS CITY TO THE MILD OR SERVITUDE OF HE SAVAGES
Line_1905	THE VANITY OF KELISTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE OPPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MOUNK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POP WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLEARGY WAS IGNORENT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THIOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
Line_1906	EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERITICXS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
Line_1907	AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVINIEW OF THE THROWN WAS SALTED WITH GOLD
Line_1908	SIXTY EIGHT BISHOUPS TWENTY TWO OF METRAPOLITIN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODUST AND TEMPERAT PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNTCILES OF THEIR BRETHERIN
Line_1909	THIS DEAL OF CARL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENELTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEBLE GOVERMENT AND A SUPERSTITCIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRASE
Line_1910	THE PAST HE REGRETED HE WAS DIS CONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS OWN POPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECRECED THE NUMBER OF THE SCISMATICS WHO REVEARED NISTORIOUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FATHE
Line_1911	AT THESE BLASTFOMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLERS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
Line_1912	BY THE VIGULENCE OF MEMBNOHNE THE CHERCHES WERE SHOT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHIADRAL
Line_1913	ARDANT IN THE PRSECUTION OF HERISY CARIL OSPITIOUSLY OPENED HIS RAIN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIONS THE MOST INCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTORIES
Line_1914	ARESTIS COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TWO QUICKLY FORGOTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THE ADOSIAS AND TWO DEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PREFECT OF EAJGIPT
Line_1915	THE FEBLE SON OF ARCADIOS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAIDED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE UNICXS AND WOMEN OF THE PALIS SUPERSTITION AND AVERIS WERE THEIR RULING PASIONS AND THE ORTHEDOCXS CHIFS WERE ASIDUUS IN THEIR ENDEVERS TO ALARM THE FORMAR AND TO GRATIFY THE LATER
Line_1916	BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHERCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERCEDED BY A MORE SOUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DAUTY
Line_1917	WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITINTS OF YUROUP AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCKNALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DISIS BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
Line_1918	NISTORIOUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR PPROACH OF HIS ESTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDICESOR CRISSTOME TO DESCLAME THE GURISTICTION IN END TO DISSOBAY THE SUMMENDS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS OCCUSOR PROSIDED IN THE SET OF JUDGMENT
Line_1919	SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMATE VERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PREMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERESED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLLINY
Line_1920	DURING A BISY PERIAD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPOROR TRIED EVERY METHOD ACCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONSIL THIS THIOLOGICAL QUORRAL
Line_1921	A ROMOUR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CRISTIONS THAT THE DAUGTER OF THEN WAS THE ONLY OBSTICALE TO THE RECONSILIATION OF THE PREFECT IN THE ARCH BISHOP AND THAT OBSTICALE WAS SPEDILY REMOVED
Line_1922	HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUISIDE
Line_1923	OUST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
Line_1924	HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFTOBLE CHAT
Line_1925	WHEN WE TOOK OUR SETS AT THE BRECFOST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
Line_1926	AS HER QUITE FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEET WATER STOOL A GLANCE AT MISTER GRICE
Line_1927	THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
Line_1928	WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELTSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MAR AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBY BELOW
Line_1929	AND SHE SPEAK OF NO WEAPON
Line_1930	I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
Line_1931	SWEET WATER SOME ONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
Line_1932	AND THE GLANCE SHE CASTD HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS Y SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMITION
Line_1933	JUST IN EVERY DAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITCIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOUROW
Line_1934	I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIOND VERY I SHOULD SAY
Line_1935	A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
Line_1936	ITS THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
Line_1937	JORGE HE NODED
Line_1938	WHO CAME NEXST ON THE SEN SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LABY
Line_1939	THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ON AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TUTCH HER
Line_1940	NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
Line_1941	HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
Line_1942	NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BILDING
Line_1943	YES MANY TIMES
Line_1944	ITS A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRICE
Line_1945	A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORADOR BEHIND AT THE FOR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
Line_1946	NO DOUT
Line_1947	WHERE EVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
Line_1948	THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE S BUNDLED UP LAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
Line_1949	INSTANTLY THEY OBSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DEARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
Line_1950	THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
Line_1951	I ASKED AS SOON AS JEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
Line_1952	WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
Line_1953	YES MISTER SLATOR THE ASSISTANT MAJOR WHO WAS IN THE LUBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
Line_1954	SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PERPOSS WHICH LEAD HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
Line_1955	NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
Line_1956	I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
Line_1957	THERE WAS NO POIIARD IN THE WOUND
Line_1958	IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPF OVER JEORGE
Line_1959	YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
Line_1960	SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
Line_1961	WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRACE
Line_1962	DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALENER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
Line_1963	YES HE'S MORE CURIARL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
Line_1964	WELL WELL THATS OUST AT ALL EVENTS
Line_1965	THEIR GRETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATERS FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT Y OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
Line_1966	I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESKYOU SPEAK OVE AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
Line_1967	HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE IT STILL HAS ITS ALERNMENT FOR HIM
Line_1968	THE BOYS LOOK QUITE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT

Line_1970	I'LL WATE HERE TILL YOURE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER IM AN OLD AND ROMATICK INVILLID WHO HAS BEEN YOUSED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
Line_1971	BENT OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
Line_1972	IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
Line_1973	VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
Line_1974	NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I WAS SHOULD SAY
Line_1975	THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
Line_1976	THE BOY'S LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
Line_1977	WHAT DOS HE WANT
Line_1978	HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO JEORGE
Line_1979	THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR ANT
Line_1980	BUT VICKUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELLIVATER
Line_1981	THE NEXT MINNETE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
Line_1982	ING KNOW IT SOUNDS FOULLISH BUT THE ALTURNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
Line_1983	YES
Line_1984	BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
Line_1985	BUT NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
Line_1986	THIS SWEET WATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTAGAS AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAIVERIT
Line_1987	CORE
Line_1988	IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBY AND THERE IT ITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
Line_1989	I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
Line_1990	SWEET WATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
Line_1991	ANY BODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
Line_1992	THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UN CONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
Line_1993	THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
Line_1994	I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
Line_1995	I INQUIRED OF JEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FIRTIVE WATCHER
Line_1996	VERY WELL THEN YOURE IN A POSITION TO PRE NEAR ME
Line_1997	HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBAY ANY SUMONDS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
Line_1998	ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSITIONS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
Line_1999	OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
Line_2000	I EMPHCISED COMPLAANTLY
Line_2001	THERE WAS NO DOUTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
Line_2002	AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
Line_2003	BUT I AM IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
Line_2004	BUT CLUES THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
Line_2005	I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
Line_2006	FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINET BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSITION'S GALLORY
Line_2007	HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRICE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLIMS AS THESE
Line_2008	MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENTS PERPLEXCITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
Line_2009	IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
Line_2010	MARK SOWOERBY AND CLOUSE HINTERBERG
Line_2011	NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ONE OR NEAR HER IN THE MESNINE WHAT FOLLOWS
Line_2012	THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOR CONTAINED A CHERIET TRIUMPFUL ON TWO WEALS WHICH BY A GRIFFNS NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
Line_2013	BY HIS DEFALT SHORT WHILE HE SUJURNED HERE BY HIS DEFALT TO WEAPING AND TO TOILE HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LATER AND SWEET PLAY
Line_2014	YOU KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETURNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
Line_2015	TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELYEANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFLICTED
Line_2016	THE GOOD SUPREME SOL IN ITSELF DELIGTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANDFUL OF ETURNAL PIECE
Line_2017	AND I BEHELLD THE FLAMELITS ON WARD GLOW LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENS HAD THE SEMBLENCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DESTINCT WITH SEVEN FOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLORS WHENCE THE SONDS BOW IS MADE AND DILIAS GIRL
Line_2018	AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SOUBBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PEARSED ME THROUGH AIRE FROM MY BOY HOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
Line_2019	DOUNTAY BECAUSE VIRDILLIOUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEAP YET DO NOT WEAP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SORD THOU NEADST MUST WEAP
Line_2020	SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL OPPLYGEANCES FOR HIS SELVATION WERE ALL READY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PREDICTION
Line_2021	BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BIRDON TO THEIR RIMS
Line_2022	BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MIND WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
Line_2023	TO SAY UNTO VERGILIOUS NOT A DRUM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
Line_2024	THIS EVERY OTHER SAVER DOTH TRANSEND AND NOT WITH STANDING SLAKEDE SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THE NO MORE
Line_2025	THEREFORE MY ANSOR IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEAPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOL BE OF ONE MEASURE
Line_2026	THESE STANDARDS TO THE REAR WORD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTER MOST UPPART
Line_2027	I DO NOT THINK THERE SHOWN SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANS FIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS YOUSUAL CUSTOM
Line_2028	LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOTH IM BEATORIS
Line_2029	THREE MADENS AT THE RIGHT WALL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY READ THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN KNOTED
Line_2030	NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
Line_2031	THOUGH MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT BROCAPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
Line_2032	IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GATE EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
Line_2033	AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
Line_2034	BUT BY THE LARGES OF SULESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOTY VAPERS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
Line_2035	I SAW THE LADY WHO IRE WHILE APPEARD VALED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELLICK FESTIVAL DIRECT HER YES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
Line_2036	AND WHAT ALARMENTS OR WHAT DVANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOUGH SHOULDST TURN THY FOOT STEPS UNTO THEM
Line_2037	CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORSED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS KNEADFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
Line_2038	NOW HELECOHNE MUST NEEDS POR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER QUIERE YORONEIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VIRSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
Line_2039	AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK ALGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDIDED
Line_2040	THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALLBEN FASIONED OUT OF EMORALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN

Line_2048	GENTLEMAN HE SAID IN A HORSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DROW BACK
Line_2049	NORTIEEY LOOKED UPON MORE WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALLENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
Line_2050	THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
Line_2051	I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAIRS WILL BE MORE FIRVANT THAN MINE
Line_2052	JEVENIE RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
Line_2053	AND THE CRY ISUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE

Line_2514	THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
Line_2515	IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHAMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPEITS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TON
Line_2516	FOR AMBROSH MY MAMA COME HERE

Line_2518	THE WEAK FOLLOWING CRISMIUSS BROUGHT IN A THOUGH AND BY KNEW YEARS DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
Line_2519	BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRATES POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN HM
Line_2520	THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
Line_2521	HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPYNESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HANDS TUTCHED THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
Line_2522	BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONSERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
Line_2523	HOW INFINATE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
Line_2524	FORE CRISMUSS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOLK COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL OVEN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
Line_2525	THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANE PRACTICAL SHRUDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SMINS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
Line_2526	I CAN NOT THINK WHAT POSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWN CASTE AND THAT I MUST GO MEDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNTS PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
Line_2527	MARGRET MET JEMWILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
Line_2528	HER CRISS BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS AKING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
Line_2529	OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BRETHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
Line_2530	MARRY I ALMOST LOTHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LYE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PASSED AND GONE AND MARRY AS SHE TRIED TO RELICE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
Line_2531	BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
Line_2532	IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER ONE SCOLDED BY MISS SIMINS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESS MAKER
Line_2533	MARRY AND ALLIS DROW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SOROW FOR SOME TIME
Line_2534	IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
Line_2535	BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE WHOLYIST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDAMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW PRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DIS HEARTONED GLOMY PERSON
Line_2536	HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JIM'S MANNEUR IND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TAIL THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLANELY
Line_2537	DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
Line_2538	THE OLD LEVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTER FORMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS A THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
Line_2539	BUT HE STAIED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STIRTY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
Line_2540	SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
Line_2541	WISHING HIM SAID MARRY IN A TON OF INQURY
Line_2542	SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER NE CRYING WITH OUT LET OR PAUS BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DESTEIRB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALLIS LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BORD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFACATE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
Line_2543	THEN ALIS BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING

Line_2545	OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CAN NOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
Line_2546	WHAT BANCRUBTS IN THE WORLD WE FEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEASES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINDS
Line_2547	SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO JEORGE AND GAIN WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DEAR TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
Line_2548	I THINK I CAN NOT GO RIGHT FOR I ITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWN RIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
Line_2549	THE GULE LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BOLKED OF ITS PREY
Line_2550	THE BORD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CACE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOOK CLAPOL HER HUSBONDS BUCKINGHAM SHIRE PERRISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
Line_2551	HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAIED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
Line_2552	ALL AFTER NON HE SAT IN THE DININGROM
Line_2553	HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FELL RELIFE FROM PAIN
Line_2554	HE MADE THE SIN F THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
Line_2555	HE SAT STILL AND IMPASIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
Line_2556	AT ABOUT FORE CLOCK A VISITER APPEARED MISTER SHAMERDA WARING HIS RABITSKIN CAP IN COLOR AND KNEW MITENS HIS WIFE HAD NITED
Line_2557	MORNING PRAIRS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
Line_2558	GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WARING THE WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
Line_2559	BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORSE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT YOUSE
Line_2560	SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTEN CLOTH AND WE SOED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
Line_2561	I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YOULCKA AND ANTONIEIA EVEN YOULCA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
Line_2562	THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GRACING THEIR BOATS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLADING WIPLASHES
Line_2563	WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLOUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRAND MOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANTING A SURPRISE FOR ME
Line_2564	ANY WAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
Line_2565	FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HY AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
Line_2566	I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MET JAKE
Line_2567	BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CRISMUS EVE
Line_2568	ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROPED SUNDAY SOL CARDS AND ADVEARTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
Line_2569	HE YOUSED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CRISMUS TREES FOR ME IN VERGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
Line_2570	I CAN SEE THEM KNOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMP LIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDLY MOLDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOME HOW UN FINISHED ATO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FOROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
Line_2571	HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
Line_2572	WAS HIS MIND WONDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
Line_2573	LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
Line_2574	WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOM OF HIS MANER
Line_2575	I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE IM FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST KNOW
Line_2576	OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNES
Line_2577	HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEAVERED HEAD

Line_2579	I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WORMLY
Line_2580	RANDLE WAITED WHILE IN LUNDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENEDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
Line_2581	I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
Line_2582	NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTIN BENEDICK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNY'S INTREST TO MAKE INQURIES AT HIS CLUB
Line_2583	AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
Line_2584	RANDLE WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERIN PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
Line_2585	THIS ALTURNATIVE IN THE CAPTIN'S PLANS TURMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUSLED RANDLE
Line_2586	I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
Line_2587	YOU CAN'T DO IT
Line_2588	SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSADE HER SHALL BE DONE
Line_2589	HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTELL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIDENM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
Line_2590	HAD HER BEAUTY FASINATED HIM
Line_2591	HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF HE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVIN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDLE AFTER THE BRAKE UP OF THE FAMILY
Line_2592	YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE YOUSED TO SEEING A PRITTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
Line_2593	LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
Line_2594	HE DRANK THE WIN GREATILLY
Line_2595	I'M AFRAID HE SAID
Line_2596	RANDLE HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY IS
Line_2597	THE SAILING MASTER ANOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLINATION THAN THAT THE CRUS WAS OVER
Line_2598	IM ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
Line_2599	MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTELL
Line_2600	BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSER THE CHILD'S INQURIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
Line_2601	RANDEL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PEAROGRAFHE
Line_2602	MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
Line_2603	GOOD BY DEAR RANDELE
Line_2604	ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
Line_2605	THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSES THOROULY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
Line_2606	WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
Line_2607	IT WAS A RELIEFE TO RANDOLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERIN'S RELATIONS TO WARD BENEDICK TO RETURN TO LUNDON WITH OUT HAVING THE SEN HIS FRIEND
Line_2608	BUT IF THESE NEWS PAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER REPORT IS TRUE FALSE HOW MUCH GOSEP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVERIT NEWSPAPERS
Line_2609	WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
Line_2610	YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
Line_2611	YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINNING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERSY ON HER

Line_2613	HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS KNORMONS LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
Line_2614	HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
Line_2615	AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARIVED AT THE COLLOMS SPECIALY DEVOATED TO FASIONABLE INTELIGENCE

Line_2622	THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEKLY GERNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDOLE BOUGHT IT
Line_2623	ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SIDENHM SO AS TO ARIVE AT THE HOTELL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
Line_2624	AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S OTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
Line_2625	RANDL PASSED THIS OVER WITH OUT KNOTISE
Line_2626	HILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LUNDON CAME IN
Line_2627	SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
Line_2628	ONESTLY
Line_2629	A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
Line_2630	SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SOSPITIOUSLY
Line_2631	THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOD FRIEND
Line_2632	IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CROUL FOLSEHOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POR KITTY'S NATURAL INQURIES RAISED AN INSUPARABLE OBSTICLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
Line_2633	WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
Line_2634	YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTELL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERIN
Line_2635	WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAITE HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDLV'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDED AND TROTHFUL IN HER CARACTOR THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIENDS WIFE
Line_2636	EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENYDECKS PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMIS SINCE RANDLV'S VISIT TO SIDENAM
Line_2637	HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TO WARD PERSADING CATHERIN TO GRANT SIDNY AND INTERVIEW
Line_2638	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
Line_2639	NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSEP IN PRIVET THE GREY PUBLICK APPTIGHTE DEVOURS GOSEP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE ETITOR CAN SUPPLY
Line_2640	HE ADDED SIDNIY'S ADRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DESPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
Line_2641	SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MOROW
Line_2642	CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICASY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTEMATE FRIEND
Line_2643	BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDLE COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
Line_2644	BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSEBLE TO INFURE THAT THE MARIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTIONS PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERIN'S REPLY
Line_2645	SUPPOSING THE REPORTE HAD BEEN TRUE
Line_2646	THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TOUNG CAN UTER
Line_2647	BEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREEN HOUSE OF MY HANDS THIS OUTUM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
Line_2648	I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SORING A LOT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UP LIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
Line_2649	SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACE AS IT IT NEVER HAS AKED YET WHEN MY CORAGE FALLS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOL COUNTS THE COUST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
Line_2650	VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILCONS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOL I WILL ON HIS STOMECK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
Line_2651	NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STEIRLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWUILIGHT A TALL MAN AND ARM BLUE ENTERED QUIETELY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUAL FIGUR FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLGIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
Line_2652	NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
Line_2653	EXCOLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
Line_2654	THE LOALE FRIENSY FELL UPON THE THREE QUITE WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
Line_2655	TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTADGE IN THE LAINE
Line_2656	NOW HE ANT ITS A TRANER ADDED AN LISY
Line_2657	I COULD NOT LOVE THE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT OUR MORE

Line_2659	THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITH OUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
Line_2660	IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY NAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHELERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
Line_2661	HER MEETING WITH LETY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN KNEIRSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
Line_2662	HE WAS NOT AS UN MOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SOUNDRY MANELY INMPULSES TO UP AND AM WHEN HIS COMRADS AND THE SHOP DISCUST THE CRICIS WITH IRNFULL BRANDISHING OF ALS AND VENGHFUL POUNDING OF SOL LETHER AS IF THE REBLES WERE UNDER THE HAMMER

Line_2667	A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRAGE FAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEAING BRECKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LAYS BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVIDS EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
Line_2668	YOU YOUNG FOAKS TAKE A WEADING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ONE WITH OUT YOU
Line_2669	DAIVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
Line_2670	AS A MARIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEAD YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT AD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
Line_2671	NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CRISTY
Line_2672	WE CAN'T AFORD NO NICE PILES NOW WHEN OUR MEAN ARE SUFFERING SO
Line_2673	THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTENT WAS PRECIOUS
Line_2674	BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAME WAS TWO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
Line_2675	HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED INTO APPLAD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCRECED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER INCHIEFE EMBORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
Line_2676	ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROD SOLS THAT LIVING WAVE BLEW BELOW MBRIGHT WITH A STAY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET IN A WAY TO JOIN THE SEE OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBD BACK READENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
Line_2677	DAVID AND CRISTY WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHEAD ANY TIRISO FOR THE BRIEF HAPPYNESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOILY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
Line_2678	FINDING THAT LICHA SHOWED THE LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VERIOUS SORTS
Line_2679	DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FIRTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER EMBRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK ONTO THE ELUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
Line_2680	HE WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANCERED CRISTY SCALING THE PROMIS WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
Line_2681	THEN THE GOOD SOL OPENLY SHOLDERED THE BRAIN SHE HAD BORN SO LONG AND SECRITE AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ONE ALONE
Line_2682	THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGUMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
Line_2683	YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO

Line_2685	WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CRISTY WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO
Line_2686	IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
Line_2687	HE S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FATHFULLY
Line_2688	SO CRISTY TURNED TO DEATH ER TO HER PROFHETTIC SOL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISTFUL HOLLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
Line_2689	NOW LETS BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINET OF IT
Line_2690	YES DAVID SISTERN SWEET HEART ANSERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FRVER OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD

Line_2693	MOTHER SAIYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE WERE LOST LEY AND I SOMETIMES FELL AS IF I HAD
Line_2694	NOW SIN THY BE YOU SATISFIED
Line_2695	THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SIMLACKS RIATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMIS AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
Line_2696	THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE KNOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE KNEADED NOW WE CAN NOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALENT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
Line_2697	I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY

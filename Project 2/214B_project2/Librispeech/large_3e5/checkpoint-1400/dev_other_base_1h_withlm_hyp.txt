Line_0	ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURT YARD WORE THE PALISE BILDINS IN ONE KNEES LIVED WITH OBSCIRDIS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALSCIOPAY AND MEDIA LIVED WITH THEIR HAND MADENS
Line_1	WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THERE AFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FRESIS
Line_2	AS HEART WAS FILLED WITH RATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHOWN AS A LEPPERDS YES
Line_3	SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
Line_4	WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTYIEST OF THE HEROS OF GREECE
Line_5	AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JACIEN AND HIS COMRADS WITH THE SONS OF FRICIS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
Line_6	MIETIA TO HIS WISE DAUTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
Line_7	JACSON TOOK PELLIOUS AND TELEMAHNE WITH HIM
Line_8	THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
Line_9	THEN I SOD THE FUROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DIMEATOR GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGN
Line_10	AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KEN IN A QUIET VOICE JASION SAID
Line_11	SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
Line_12	AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDSLISE TO BEAR WAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
Line_13	IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE TRUELY OF THE SEED OF THE IMORTALS
Line_14	THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
Line_15	FOR GAIN WAS THE GRAND SON OF CRETHIOUS AND CRETHIOUS WAS THE BROTHER OF THEMS THEIR GRANDFATHER
Line_16	AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARDS HER IT WAS BEEN CHACED BY A HOCK AND MEYA SAW THE HOOKS YES AND BEAK
Line_17	THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROWS WAS HE WONDER OF THE PALLISE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
Line_18	ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTFOS THE SARMATY
Line_19	HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
Line_20	BUT IF YOU CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY SITTY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YEALD T TO ONE WHO CAN NOT SHOW HIMSELF HIS BRAVE
Line_21	FRANTIS AND MELL S WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
Line_22	HE WITH HIS COMRADS WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
Line_23	AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MITIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
Line_24	IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLIECSE
Line_25	I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROS AT AS IT IS
Line_26	AND MANY OF THE MAGITIONS OF EAGIPT WHO HAD COME WITH KAN SICOSTROUS STAYED IN THAT SITTY AVAA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLES SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN ARISING AND SETTING
Line_27	NOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ERRIS YOUNDER I HAVE TWO FIRBRIDIANT BUS WITH FEET AREAS
Line_28	WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DYE ON THE WALL AND ANOTHER IN THE BUSOM OF HIS FAMILY
Line_29	FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EAGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDET FROM HOME THEY ARE ONLY DESTINGWISHED BY THE OBSERDITY OF THEIR MEANS
Line_30	SO DIED SOCRTIES AND GRDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY HEROW OF THE TROTHS SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRISTS
Line_31	WEAPING IS ACCORDINGY SIMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SIMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURSE
Line_32	THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDGUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
Line_33	IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPPASSIT FOR LOVE AND SIMPATHY AND ALSO PON IMAGINATION
Line_34	EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FAT THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOGT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEAP SIMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEAPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
Line_35	FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEAPS FOR THE FAT OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEAPS WIN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERENCE
Line_36	WE WHO HERE SEK THE THEORY OF VIRTU AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVAY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
Line_37	THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
Line_38	HE SEES THAT THE DESTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULE ONLY BLONGS TO A FLING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON
Line_39	THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONSERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUT GOOD OR BAD FORTON
Line_40	YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUT WAY THEIR GARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
Line_41	FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFARING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
Line_42	WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROGH OUR OWN SUFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
Line_43	HE RECOGNIZES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEN AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUPER
Line_44	BUT THE LATER IS THE NECESSARY AND INNEVITABLE SIMPTM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
Line_45	FOR THE INTREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMOARABLE MANIFESTATIONS CAN NOT CAUSE SUCH ANSIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
Line_46	THEREFORE ALL THOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MAN KIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL N YET THE PERMINENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEANS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND AVEN SERENTY OF DISPOSITION
Line_47	THE DEADS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDGUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
Line_48	IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIVED DOCTRIN OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THERE BY MOROALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
Line_49	THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPALES WHICH THEY GAVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VERTU AND LAWS WHICHU IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREDY BEEN SAID CAN NOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETURNALY FREE WILL
Line_50	THE OPPSET OF THE STEAM OF CONSCIONCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICENCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIONCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DIS INTERESTED DEAD
Line_51	AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HARACOLIS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BISNESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD WOULD BE LEFT UN DONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITH OUT BRING ONE WITH HIM
Line_52	THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER ES BLIRED AND ER HER NEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURT YARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MADED HAIR
Line_53	WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MY KNOW APPOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIEND SHIP FOR ME SAID NADMETS
Line_54	AND AS A MORTALE APPOLLOW SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
Line_55	AD MEDIS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
Line_56	IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
Line_57	AND THEN HERACLIS FELT THAT ANOTHER LEABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
Line_58	AND AS FOR ADMETOS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND NELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCASTIS SADLANE AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
Line_59	IF ONE WILL GO WILINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO AT MESS
Line_60	THAT WAS BEFORE HAD MEDOWS SAILED ON THE ARE WITH GASEN AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
Line_61	AFTERWARDS PEOPLE WONDERED AT AD MESSES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERADIANT BEN
Line_62	NOW THE FOOT STEPS SEEMED TO STOP
Line_63	BUT APPOLLO TURNED TO ADMETOS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_64	AT MIS AT MEATS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
Line_65	HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KIN AND GO WITH DEATH
Line_66	THIS I CANNOT DO SAID AD MET I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
Line_67	DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
Line_68	THEN AT MOOSE RAISED THE VAL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
Line_69	IT IS FO ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO A MEADMEDICS AND MEDIC KNOW THAT EVEN KNOW THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
Line_70	AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONCENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
Line_71	I'VE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDER WORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GARDS LOADS WHOM DETHPBRINED SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD
Line_72	YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISS TO GO FORTH FROM THIS SAMPLE WITH OUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
Line_73	HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRENT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO AD MEATS
Line_74	HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I ONE HER FROM AN ENEMY
Line_75	HE LIFTED ALKESTAS THROWN THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALLIS
Line_76	SHE WAS VALED AND ADMETTIS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
Line_77	NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALIS
Line_78	WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
Line_79	HE LEFT THE PALIS OF ADMETTOS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPE OF THE GODS
Line_80	ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KIN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
Line_81	BUT STILL APPOLLOW STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_82	AND WHAT A KNOBLE THEM IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
Line_83	NO MORE SPEACH CAME FROM HER
Line_84	THEN ADMETIS WENT INTO THE PALLIS AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LAND WORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE REACHED ONES ROUND THE PALISCSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
Line_85	A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND HAD MEATS KNEW THAT DIS WAS APPOLLOW COME TO HIM AGAIN
Line_86	AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURT YARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
Line_87	BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HOROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
Line_88	THERE AFTER AT MEADOS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
Line_89	TO WHAT GOD DOES THAT SACRIFICE DO
Line_90	JUST A SATISFYING I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
Line_91	IN ANY CASE HE FLEW PO PRANTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
Line_92	AFTER HEAD EATEN A FIR MAIL HE FELL ASLEEP
Line_93	I RAN UP PULL IM A GUN
Line_94	IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOSN'T LIKE US AND HE CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
Line_95	THEIR COLFIN WEARS THEIR SHIP AND THE GRAVE IT WAS THE S BLOW HEY BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE S DONE ON THE COST OF THE HIGH BARBARI
Line_96	A THIRD O THE TREATOR WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MAN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SKAM DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
Line_97	THEN AGAIN HID SING THAT BARBORYS SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DID IT GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE JUST TALK
Line_98	WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
Line_99	THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY D YOU TELL ME
Line_100	THERE WAS NO DOUT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOS WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
Line_101	WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US IN ONE AND AS I WAS LOOK OUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
Line_102	YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN NOT PITCH YOU UP I REPLIED
Line_103	HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK ES OF HIR'S BLASING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
Line_104	HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SOSPITIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSOR WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
Line_105	WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
Line_106	ONE LITTLE SCQUESE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS

Line_421	HE FELT REVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COOD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
Line_422	STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIAR OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRIGHTE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BIRSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
Line_423	THEN A MORTL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TO WARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW

Line_432	THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
Line_433	NOT LONG AFTER A FARM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
Line_434	IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
Line_435	THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
Line_436	IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTIST WITH OUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENCE OF INCONGROUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SULIITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MIS GIVING AND FATH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXRSISE OF MEMORY DOUS NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPERTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE

Line_1300	HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNADENELY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
Line_1301	IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDAY'S POIMS ABOUT WAW ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILLITY THAN HIS POIMS ABOUT LOVE
Line_1302	HOW LONG HE CRISS IN A POME RITEN SOME YEARS AGO
Line_1303	AND PROSINTRUDS IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES

Line_1309	BUT WHAT A SENCE OF TRIUMPTH THERE IS IN BROWNAIN'S TRAGITIES
Line_1310	BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GREAVE PARTS STEALS LETS PART ABID AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBINGS OF NON TIDE
Line_1311	TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDAY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DAPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
Line_1312	HE DOUS NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
Line_1313	MISTER HARD HAS TO BITTER A SENCE OF REALLITY TO BELIDE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
Line_1314	AND OUR WIVES QUATH ANOTHER RESINEDLY DOL THEY ARN OUR DAD'S
Line_1315	THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STILE OF LIRIC POWITRY IN THESE LINES BUT FRAISES LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE OUR STROAKED ITS THUMB ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING AT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMON PLACE

Line_1320	NOTHING OF TINEST BIRTH HAVE I ROUGHT PONTERED PLANED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAYS SINCE THE PALE CORKS LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNETE BEARING BLANK IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
Line_1321	BUT PERHAPS HIS CARACTORISTIC ATITUD TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELLANCOLY POME THE SOLS OF THE SLANME IN WHICH THE SOLS OF THE DEAD SOLDGIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SNIOUR SOLFLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELLITIVES HAVE CEPTD THEIR DOUTY DEADS IN REMEMBERANCE

Line_1325	HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
Line_1326	THAT IS WHY CRIM AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN CREA OF FATHERS AND SONS

Line_1328	EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SAN MAN
Line_1329	IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
Line_1330	BUT THE SECRITE OF DOUSTIERSKIE'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CARRACTERS
Line_1331	AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTAL MAKNESS SIN ON THE IMAGES OF HOLDS THE VONIC SAINTS
Line_1332	IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOUSTEESKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR ATHOR
Line_1333	THE OULTERMATE ATTITUDE OF DOUSTESKY IS AS CRISTION AS THE APPOSTL PEERS LORD I BELIEVE HELPED THOU MY ON BELIFE
Line_1334	CERTAINLY THE LOST OF CROULTY THE LUSTER DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOUSTEESKIES MAN AND WMAN
Line_1335	WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BARING THEM WITH GREAT SERIMONY
Line_1336	AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETABLE FRAGMENCS OF DILOG THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
Line_1337	WE SIMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRIVADO THE DESPARE THAT SUCAD THE CRIME
Line_1338	HIS CARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH GELLOSY OR FALL IN EPOLEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HISTERICALY
Line_1339	DOUSTEESKIY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
Line_1340	THERE IS IN DOUSTEESKY A SUGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SERTABOS
Line_1341	LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVALIST OF TORTURE
Line_1342	MISTER MARRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIPICLTY AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFONITION
Line_1343	ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MOLTAPLICITY OF ACTION
Line_1344	NO MILLAGUMATIST EVER PORED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
Line_1345	SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DIMATRY BRETHLESSLY
Line_1346	AS FOR THE CARMSOVES THEMSELVES HE PETRAYSE THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRIUTAL MANIACS
Line_1347	THAT IS A PORTRET OF THE MAN ONE SAYS BEHIND DOSTESK HIS KNOBELES A PORTRET ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERED FROM THE KNOBLES
Line_1348	WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SETED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIL OR AMONG VAGABONDS HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
Line_1349	ULTERMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
Line_1350	AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMT DEVLKAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
Line_1351	IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES HANDRYPILLS
Line_1352	HE TOOK A NIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM COUSCIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AM TURNED HIS EYES HETENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FIRVANTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CRISTS SAKE
Line_1353	TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENYH THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOUSTEISK HIS WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOL IS IT BATTLES WITH DOUT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIRE
Line_1354	THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE CURE
Line_1355	BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ALWAYS IN DIMONICAL CONFLICT
Line_1356	AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPPATING THE NIGHT DOUSTESKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CRISTIAN COMPAION
Line_1357	IF DORLSTESKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAE BEEN STRINBERG
Line_1358	TO HIM DOSTERISK HIS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
Line_1359	HE NEVER PANTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOUSTEESKY OR A NIGHT MAR AT DOUSTEESKY
Line_1360	HE IS A GROTESK MADE ALIVE BY SHER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
Line_1361	HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESS AS DICKENS ADVANTS COMEC GROTESCS
Line_1362	THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOMEONE INTHEITIOUS
Line_1363	THE KNOBLES RE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
Line_1364	EVEN THE TALK HIS ONE ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
Line_1365	HE MAY NOT BE A CROUL ALSO
Line_1366	DOUSTESKY COULD NOT HAV DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NELIDOVE IN RESORECTION
Line_1367	HE SAW HIS VILENT DADES NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
Line_1368	ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTISTS AN ABENORMAL CARACTER OR TWO
Line_1369	BECAUSE THEY ARE POSESED THEY ARE NO LONGER MAN AND WOMAN
Line_1370	OR EVEN BY THE COMPASION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISKN IN THE IDIATE
Line_1371	BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BED CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE

Line_1826	TIMOROR SAD THAT SIN WAS FOR HEEL THEY MEAT TO CLIME BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MEAT WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
Line_1827	CRISTION SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MONSIAN
Line_1828	SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS NEES TO BRAVE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL BISACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROB
Line_1829	WORDS ARE TO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CRISTION WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS ROW
Line_1830	FOR MADIEST AND HIPOCRSY WE WERE BOARD IN THE LAND FING GLORY AND OUR ON OUR WAY TO MOUNTS DIE FOR PRAYS

Line_1833	HUH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGING THE NODE FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEAT WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
Line_1834	CRISTION GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESS CROWS BLESSTD TON
Line_1835	BUT THEY WOULD KNOW COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAN
Line_1836	YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FOUNDING HIS CLOTHE FOR HIS GROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND IT SOME PEACE
Line_1837	JUST AS TRISTION CAME UP TO THE CROWS HIS LOADS SLIT FROM HIS BAT CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
Line_1838	THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS SHIMMANIOUS LAND
Line_1839	YES SAID THEY NO DOUT OF IT
Line_1840	PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MA SHOULD WISH TO MUCH TO GO TO MON D IN
Line_1841	THEN I SAW IN MY DREM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY DO HE CAME AND STOOL INFRONT OFTHE LODGE REAR WATCHFUL DROUT
Line_1842	CRISTION WHAT DOES IS MEAN
Line_1843	FEAR OR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOND BY CHANGE AND ARE OUT HERE TO TRY THE FATH OF THOSE BAD HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE BAT HATH KNOWN
Line_1844	HE STOPPED AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
Line_1845	THEN CRISTION BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH HIM TO THE HOUSE
Line_1846	HIGHTY CALM GOOD CRISTION SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE HEALING TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A F THAT YOUD HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
Line_1847	I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE ATE THAT IF I COME HERE YOU WOLD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
Line_1848	HOW FAR MITE I HAVE TO BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
Line_1849	KNOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VAILE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR SPELL HE SAT DOWN IN WEAPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS ROW WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK
Line_1850	CRISTION WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
Line_1851	KEEP IN THE MISTER OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO VE
Line_1852	CRISTION SIR WHAT HOUSE IT THIS BARE REST HERE TO NIGHT
Line_1853	HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
Line_1854	HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VAL WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
Line_1855	NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
Line_1856	WHEN WATCHFLE TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_1857	KNOW YOUR NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMES UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THEE
Line_1858	CRISTION ERS WENTS COME YOU AND WHERE DOUG TO GO
Line_1859	SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JUS FOR THIR SEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE REST S AND I AM MAD TO TRADE THOSE STEPS WITH GREFE WHICH IN MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BE FOR THIS SLEEP
Line_1860	CRISTION WHAT MEANS THESE
Line_1861	I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TIL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HELD OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
Line_1862	AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN AS WITH WHICH SENSENDID SUCH RAFT AND THE SLANE AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DABITS SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
Line_1863	THEN YOUR NEXT SAWT A MADE COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO HE SEEM MADE CLEANG AND LAID LOW BY FATHING THE BOOK
Line_1864	THOSE DID QUESTION TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TIL IT GRO DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PIECE THERE HE SLEPT TO BRAKE OF DAY AND THEN HE SAID A HIM
Line_1865	CHARITY HAPYOR WIFE AND BABES CPRESUMED YES I HAVE
Line_1866	THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CRISTION MADE A HEAD AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS BY STRENGHE SO SMALL
Line_1867	THEY TOLD QUESTION THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG YES HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT HE HAD BEEN SILVER YEARS
Line_1868	THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET IT THE AIMOST TO MEAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
Line_1869	OBJECTION ONE IT WLD SEEM THAT IN THE SENESENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
Line_1870	THEREFORE A SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
Line_1871	THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT OR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WS PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
Line_1872	NOW WE MAY REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
Line_1873	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INESENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMOS
Line_1874	NOW WHAT EVER IS PART IS PATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ECENCIAL AND UNIVERSAL
Line_1875	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INOSENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DESBAYD NOTHING DISABAID HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
Line_1876	IN A QUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITH OUT ANY DEFACTIL NATURE
Line_1877	I ANSER THAT WE MUST NEEDS AD MITE THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SE BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SE AND LIKE WISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SECTUL UNIN HAVE BEEN STERAL
Line_1878	SECONDLY DIS ASPROVED BY THE ORDER OF A DEIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWS GOVERNS INFEARIAR THINGS BY THE SUPERIAR
Line_1879	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF ONCE MAN WOULD KNOW HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
Line_1880	FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
Line_1881	SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INEENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
Line_1882	THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BADLY DESPEARITY
Line_1883	SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS BAY HIM
Line_1884	OBJECTION ONE HIT OLD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF HIMSENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASED OVER MAN
Line_1885	THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FETTING THE STATE INSENCE MAN HAD NOT BEANIN OVER PLANS
Line_1886	MUCH LESS FERFORE WOLD THEY HAVE A BIT MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOSENCE
Line_1887	IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFRED IN A GENERAL SENCE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENCE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEAN CAN BE CAL A MASTER
Line_1888	THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
Line_1889	AND BY VISACK WE KILLED OUR SO'S AS WELL
Line_1890	SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
Line_1891	COME GOD HELPFUL SAID GRISHON LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
Line_1892	THEN SAID TRY IN DESPAIRE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORE YOUR WEGING HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LYE IS MINE
Line_1893	THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TROTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TRVE THE SAME WAY WITH QUISTION
Line_1894	MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAY ALONG YOU MY LORD WHO ARE KNOW HIS JUDGE
Line_1895	THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KANGS SMOKE THEIRS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING NO OR TOWN
Line_1896	HOPFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CRISTION GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVETHAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
Line_1897	HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
Line_1898	JEORGE THY JUST DOME WOULD BE TO DYE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
Line_1899	QUESTION WEE YOU MUST KNOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
Line_1900	THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAT
Line_1901	I IMMEDIATLY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOTSTEPS AND FOUND HMJOKING WITH A LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFAN BE PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER COMPATIOUS LAMP
Line_1902	OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUN RISING LINDNAGIFAS DREAD EXPTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUE FOR SHURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPOTATIONS

Line_1906	THE PRINY SHOPAFAH WAS OWING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVOLS TAM AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
Line_1907	IF HE HAD JOBED OUT OF HE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RESIPRICOE
Line_1908	THEY SAY BEST MAN ARE MOTEVED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
Line_1909	WILLAM TO THE GREAT AMASEMENT OF THE DILLER FLUNG A GIEY IN THE CANOPOT WHICH WERES IMMEDIATLY TAPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ONE IN SILING EXPOTATION
Line_1910	JAMES HORBRIDGE GASED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUE MAR WHAT DO YOU KNOW
Line_1911	STANDING ON THE BROKEN COM OF THE OESTEBOR THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRAIN ROSE HILL WILLAM STRUCK AN ATITUDE OF THEARTORIECO FASION AND ATER THE FOWING ARITORICAL FLIGHT
Line_1912	THE DEVOLEST HEVEN WAS THE RESORT FOR ACTORS ATHEORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNING COUCHES
Line_1913	LINDON ITS GOT AND GLORY
Line_1914	I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE UPON THE CAST I WILL STAND THE HASARD OF THE DYE

Line_1918	AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MASHEN WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
Line_1919	I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
Line_1920	SPEAKING OF TELLING STORES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HERISIN LATIN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
Line_1921	OF COURSE A GREAT MANY COUNTS WERE WEATEN AND RAD BUT WHILE GANIAL INTRESTPRIS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
Line_1922	WHEN THE RESOUNTE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS THE PALE ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIA AE OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWATS WITH CRUSHING AND TIRANICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPADIS OF FORBIETS VARIOUSE
Line_1923	SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPOSITION OF WHICH THEIR WRIPS PLENTY
Line_1924	WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETNESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RE CAPPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOSE ENDS OF THE THREATS WOVERNING AND FOLLOWD THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE VENTS CAN BE SEEN
Line_1925	HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITOL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OUT HIS CRUD CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST A PERSONAL SURENDER
Line_1926	WHAT GOD ED AT THE GREAT BARKEN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOME DAM IN THE BALISTME WATEGAGE
Line_1927	HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON AITH AVEINOW WHO MATE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEARES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
Line_1928	THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARECLITE BUT HIT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WEARS NOT HIS LARGESORSIVE INCOME BY ANY MEANS
Line_1929	NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
Line_1930	A NUMBER OF PARENT ARKLINING COMPANIES WERE A ING EXISTANCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCALCOMPTISS HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEEN UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BISNESS AND TO EXECUTE RACULARCITIY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREAT LINE
Line_1931	HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIALIN
Line_1932	FOR MAKING THE DINAMOST AT CON ACCURED AS NOTE IN THE PROCEDING CHAPTER THAT ROACH IRN WORKS ON GO WORK STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPED
Line_1933	WHY NOT HE CAME WITH HIS VILIN ABOUT TWELVE CLOCK
Line_1934	ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND A ONE DUNK TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RENT
Line_1935	ANOTHER VISITER WHO WOULD USE TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL AMUSMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTIN SHA THEY HAD OF LUNDON FIBORY ATE
Line_1936	IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRY LIE COMPANY LEAD A OLD BE SHOE MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENEW CLOSED TO FORTINGSTREET FOR HIS HEAD QUARTERS AND SHOW RIMS
Line_1937	WOULD SAL THEM FOR FORTY SENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
Line_1938	THE MOST CONSPICUUS EXAMP OF THIS IDENTY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN THIN NEW YORK ITSELF
Line_1939	HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANTUOUS ANTISCIPATION AND A PERROULESS PLEASURE OF FACNING ATTISENS EXPERIMENTS
Line_1940	AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLO HOW TO DO IT
Line_1941	YET THE VERY BOAR OF THE ELECTRIC ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER OF THE ARRIVALE OF THE INCONDESTANT
Line_1942	FORTHE NEXT FOR OR FIVE YEAR SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERRIDABLE B HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
Line_1943	I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A ER EVEN IF I LOCKED THE MAB IN MY DUSK THEY WOULD BRAKE IT OPEN
Line_1944	HANSE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST AT IN STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE MATHORDS THEY INVALVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDIT WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PERSENT
Line_1945	IT WILL BE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LINING COMPANY SUPLIED TOIDS COUSTOMORIST BOTH INCONDESANT AND ARCLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DINAMAL ELECTRIC MASHENARY AS A SORSE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVALE SISTANCE HAS DIED OUT
Line_1946	THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
Line_1947	IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PASSED THEIR PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC THIN ESOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT AN LINING COMPASS IN THE LIDING CITY
Line_1948	ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEPENING ORSTAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DUMB BY EXPERTS
Line_1949	THUS IN THE CURIOUS MANER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LIGHTING WOLD SINK A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENCE REVORIYES AND GELISSIYS WHICH WERE NONE THELESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ALTMATE UNING OF THE FORCE WAS IN EPITABLE
Line_1950	THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LATER GAS ENGIN WAS RATHER STARTLING
Line_1951	THIS WAS NOT LAWN NOR UNIVERSALY THE SPIRITS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITS THEY LECTRIE AND ES PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE YOUSE OF BOTH ELUMINANTS
Line_1952	HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THE MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITH OUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESOUT

Line_2332	JORNT LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEDED
Line_2333	I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT
Line_2334	EXCEPT GEASPAR THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASURING HIS SUPPORT
Line_2335	HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS KNOVELE SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
Line_2336	WITH YOU LET ME HERE ORE COME AND SEE ME
Line_2337	HOW AM I TO LIVE AN OR IN SUCH UNSERTAINTY AS THIS
Line_2338	BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO ENVITE SUCH MISORY AS THIS
Line_2339	A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST KNOW FULL FILL
Line_2340	SHE HAD DEVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMENSE AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
Line_2341	WHY NEED YOU CONSEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TROTH
Line_2342	MORE OF A BRICE YOU NEED
Line_2343	I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL RIGHT TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
Line_2344	HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINEY AND THEREFORE BY MARRIAD WHO WAS FATS INSTROMENT
Line_2345	PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IMPART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
Line_2346	GESPA DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVEAR HUMILLIATION
Line_2347	HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERT UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EAST THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
Line_2348	I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
Line_2349	YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
Line_2350	TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TO EKNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
Line_2351	BUT WHY THE JOSE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
Line_2352	YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUN THAT IN DESPIGHT OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAR EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
Line_2353	I SCARSELY THOUGHT OF BIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
Line_2354	UN ABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WONDERED GLOMILLY ABOUT REAGIENTS PARK
Line_2355	THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
Line_2356	YOU FELL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
Line_2357	SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY

Line_2359	HAPPNESS OR MISORY COME TO US BY FIGHT
Line_2360	I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
Line_2361	GOOD BY SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
Line_2362	BECAUSE IN HIS SALORD DYE HE DALLEYED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTATCHMENT

Line_2365	HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PIPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
Line_2366	THERE WAS SILENCE
Line_2367	POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
Line_2368	THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
Line_2369	I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
Line_2370	WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID KNOW
Line_2371	I DO WISH IT
Line_2372	WILL HE CONCENT TO RECEIVE AN ALOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS NILVAY

Line_2384	I WILL BE FATHFUL TO YOU
Line_2385	YESTORDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSOR A REFUSAL
Line_2386	HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELWA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
Line_2387	I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY

Line_2389	BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILINGLY
Line_2390	WAS HE STILL SO VERY POR
Line_2391	ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSIOM YES
Line_2392	AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
Line_2393	IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
Line_2394	ESPECIALLY KNOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLIND NESS
Line_2395	YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPOR AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
Line_2396	DO YOU THINK THEM INSEMOUNTABLE
Line_2397	MARRIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITH OUT OUR MATING DURING THAT TIME
Line_2398	SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
Line_2399	THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
Line_2400	THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MAIN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TROTH
Line_2401	HE ROOT TO MARRY HIM
Line_2402	IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
Line_2403	AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
Line_2404	AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
Line_2405	SOON ENOUGH YOU WOLD THOROULY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERRITED MY PERVIRSE PRID WOULD REVULT AGAINST IT
Line_2406	HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUIN SUFFERING IN HIS TINES AND ASPECT
Line_2407	A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOME HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
Line_2408	WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TROTH
Line_2409	ALAS POR YORICK
Line_2410	INTREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASES SUPERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAYMENT OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFERVRELIVE TILL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVIL OWER POP COMES A CREDITER UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPALE UPON THE SPOT TO GETHER WITH FULL INTREST TO THE VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR POBLICATIONS

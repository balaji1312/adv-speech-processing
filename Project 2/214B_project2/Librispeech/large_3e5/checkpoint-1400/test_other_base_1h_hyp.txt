Line_190	BUT IN FAVER OF FORON TRAVALE I WOULD ARGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVEAL FROM CONDITIONS CALING APREMNISENCES
Line_191	FINALY HIS DESCISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROD BUT COULD PUT KNO FATH IN FOREN QUACS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NED
Line_192	BTHE SELOBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE A FENCE
Line_193	IT SEMED AS THOUGH SOME PESE OF GOD FORTOUN HAD COMED TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
Line_194	OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTS
Line_195	THE SELEBRATED DOCTOR ANOUNCED TO THE PRINCES A FELLING OF WHAT WAS DWE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE HOUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
Line_196	IS THEIRE HOPS SHE MENT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE CULD NOT UTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
Line_197	AND HO ABOUT AT TOR A BROUD ASKEDTHE FAMLY DOCTOR
Line_198	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YO HVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
Line_199	SHE ANSERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
Line_200	OH KNOW ONLY A FEOW DEETAL'S PRINCES COME THIS WAY
Line_201	WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANDS OF IMPROVING KEUTRITION ANOUGH FOR LOWARING IT
Line_202	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY KNO OBJECT IN THIS
Line_203	BEG PARDON IS THE ULSKEBRIDGE DON YET OR SHAL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROND
Line_204	HED THE DOCTOR BEGAN SIAENTIPICALLY EXPLAING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN ECEPTIONAY INTELIGANT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
Line_205	THE PRINCESS WAS DESTRACTED AND DID KOT KOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SENT AGAINST KITY
Line_206	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEAREFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUTER AND KITY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEARFUL
Line_207	HE ASKED AH IT IS
Line_208	BEFORE HER HE DESIDED TO SCATTER HIS PURLS
Line_209	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FAIT SAID THE PRINCES TELL ME EVERYTHING
Line_210	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPALE PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
Line_211	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADED
Line_212	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROM TO KITY
Line_213	THE UPER CLASSERS KNOW THAT AN ARMEY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILLWL SON BE INSUFITION AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTONS MEN THEY FEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCRECED STRENGTH OF THE ARMEY
Line_214	FOR A MAN OF THE POR WORKING CLAS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISSADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCRECE OF DIS ADVANTAGES
Line_215	AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBOROUS NATIONS IS MENT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROPS KNOW UNDER ARMS WULD BE AMPLY SUFFISCIENT FORTHAT PERPOS
Line_216	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPAR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DECENTIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFY'S ITSELF
Line_217	TO RESIST WOULD NED INDEPENDANT THOUGHT AND EFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS KNOT CAPABLE
Line_218	GOVERMENT ASSERT THAT ARMIES AE KNEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTURNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TROUE
Line_219	THE MEATING OF KAPPRIVIYS SPEACH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUEGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEADED KNOT TO RESIST FOREN FOS BUT TO BY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE RADY TO ACT AGAINSTHE INSLAVED TOILING MASSES
Line_220	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF E STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEASE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
Line_221	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVILE DESPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
Line_222	EVERY INCRECE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AME OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORTE OF DANGUR FOR NEGHBORING STATS AND CALSE FOR A SIMOLAR INCRECE IN THEIRE ARMES
Line_223	THE TACXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WARE PREPORATIONS OBSORBE THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
Line_224	SO MUCH FORTHE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINS OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WELTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSER
Line_225	ANDSO EVERY GOVERMENT NEADS AN ARMEY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGNDS
Line_226	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ECENCUALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GARDS AND MAKE THE RUCION ATHORITIES OF TDAY SO CAREFULY DISTRIBUT THE RECRUTS SO THAT THE REGIUMENTS FROM THE FROUNTER T ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIUMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FROUNTEARS
Line_227	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGL AND CONQUEST
Line_228	BUT CHAMPIANS F THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRYE TO CONECT THE IDA OF ATHORITY THAT IS OF VILENCE WITH THE IDA OF MORAL INFLOUENCE BUT THIS CONECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_229	SO THATHE JUSTIFIATION OF STATE VILENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION  GIVES US FROM EVIL DSPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THRE OR FORE SENTOURIES AGOW HAS KNONE WHAT EVER KNOW
Line_230	EDJUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENCE OF THE KNECESITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIABR
Line_231	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDERDS OF MORALS AN THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VILENCE THE EXISTANCE OF AN ATHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VILENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VILENCE OF INDIVIDJUALS ONE CAN NOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COUD NOT BE LASTI
Line_232	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDGUALS TO THE SAME NECESITY OF STRIFE SUBSTUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDGUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
Line_233	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SANCTE THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSESSION OF POWER A SOCIAL ORGANISATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
Line_234	IN FACT THE WHOLE SGNIFICENCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MANDS RECOGNITION OF THE BARBEARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDGUALS AND THE TRANSETORIANISTS OF PERSIONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFURANCE OF THE AME OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
Line_235	THE RIVALERY OF THE YURAPIAN STATS IN CONSTANTLY INCRECING THEIR FORSES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESITY OF HAVING RECOURSED THE UNIVERSALE MILITARY SIRVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDGIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE
Line_236	THE ARMY HAS ALWAY'S BEEN AND STILL IS THE BACECS OF POWER
Line_237	THE GREATE EXTENTION OF MEANS F COMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE ADE IN FORMING SU CIETIES ESOCIATIONS CORPARATIONS AND CONGRESES FOR SIENTIPIC ECONOMIC AND PLITICAL OBJECTS
Line_238	THE GOVERMNT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMEY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEGHBORING STATS WHO MIGHT INSLAVE US
Line_239	WITH OUT GOVERMENTS KNATIONS WI BE ENSLAVED BY THIR KNEIGHBORS
Line_240	THE DESPATISM OF THE GOVERMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCESSES AND THE OGRESSIVENESS OF E GOVERMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTURNAL DESPATISM
Line_241	AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESTE ALWAYS GOWS ON GROWING UP TO THE FIRTHEST LEMEN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GSE WIH THE GOLDENEKXS
Line_242	THIS ARGUMENT TBE WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME SENTORIS AGO
Line_243	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OFTHIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASES OF OUR EPOCK WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVS OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
Line_244	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWYSE
Line_245	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMEY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CEASERS TO THE RUSHIAN AND GERMAN EMPARARS TAKE MORE INTREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMEY KNOWING THAT FATS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SUCURE
Line_246	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLED BY MORAL INFLOENCE ACTS IN ACCORDENCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRS
Line_247	GOVERMT ATHORITY EVEN IF IT DOS SUPPRESS PRIVATE VILENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VILENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER INPROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERMENT
Line_248	THE BACES OF ATHORITY IS BODOLY VILENCE
Line_249	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BRAKE OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIALIGHE VAN AND FRUTLESS
Line_250	ECEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD KNOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EGUCATION COULTURLE MEANS OF COMUNICATION AND SO ON
Line_251	THE POSSIBILITY OF APLYING BODOLY VILANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANISATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISEN IN SUBMISTION TO ONE WILL
Line_252	EVEN LOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WAGING THAT IS TO SAY AL THE BIRDONS LAD ON HIM BY THE STATS NO MAN CAN FAILL TO SE TITFOR HIM PERSIONALLY TO COMPLY WIT THE STATE DOMANDS AND SERVE N THE ARMEY WOD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISSADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUS TO DO SO
Line_253	BETWEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGL ATHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDGUAL SEMED STILL LESS ANDTHE LIFE OF THE STATE SEMS EVEN MORE SUCURE
Line_254	THYE NEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE THET COMES AN ACCOMPLICE AIND ALL THAT ACTS OF VILENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITISONS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
Line_255	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
Line_256	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SIRVICSE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CROULTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSUCURITY OF EXISTANCE ARE CALLD UPON TO FACE ALL THE PEROLS THEY HAD MET TO AVOID
Line_257	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
Line_258	THISS IS ABSOLOUTELY INCORECT
Line_259	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL SITISIN'S ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE ENIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL SITISINS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
Line_260	INTERNAL DESCENTIONS DISAPPEARE ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION XERTED BY THE ATHORITY OVER THE DSCINTIAN INDIVIDGUALS
Line_261	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COUD THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION BE JUSTIFIED
Line_262	IN THE SOCIAL CONSCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIME OF LIFE IAS FOND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDGUALS INDIVIDGUALS WILL VOLLANTARALLY SACREFICE THEIR OWN INTREST FOR THE ENTREST OF THE GROUP
Line_263	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A CINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMEY
Line_264	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
Line_265	BUT THE FAITAL SUGNIFICENCE OF UNIVEIRSAL MILITARY SERVIS AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRODICTION ENHEARANT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARANT IN THAT
Line_266	FTNOT THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE BUSES OF ATHORITE EXIST INSPIGHT F T E SMAL NUMBER OF THEIR TROPS NOT ONLY FAILES TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
Line_267	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MANTAINED BY THE ARMY
Line_268	THIS INCRECE IS CONTAGOUS AS MONTASCW POINTED OUT A HNDRDN FIFTY YEARS AGO
Line_269	WE KNOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CAN NOT DEMINNISH THEIR KNUMBER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRMENT AND MORAL INFLOUENCE
Line_270	BUT THE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERMENT THERE OTHER GOVERMENTS EXPLOTINGTHEIR SUBJECTS BY VILENC IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERMENT AND CARY OF THE FRUTS OF THE TOILE OF ITS INSLAVED SUBJECTS
Line_271	BUT THIS GUASTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
Line_272	THIS INCONSISTANCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICSE
Line_273	THE POWER OF THE STATE FARE FROM BEING A SUCURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GRATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
Line_274	POR RANDSOM ANOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BEOTION AS AT THAT MOMENT
Line_275	HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOSTD TEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS BEAR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRULTY OF DEFETS
Line_276	HE WAS TO SIMPLE TO MISYSIPPIANE FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISSAPPOINTED
Line_277	IT WAS IN THE FHEMAILE LINE AS BALES AND RANDSOME HAD RITTAEN IN ANSURING HER LETTER WITH A GOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HISPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYIALE HOUSES
Line_278	SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST E RITCH ADMIORATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPORTUNITY
Line_279	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER RIGHTING TO BASAR RANDSOM AND INDED IT WAS DIFFICLT TO SE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER ECEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY ECEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASURED HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BISNESS HE WAS BEGINING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTOIN
Line_280	HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT KNO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGICK
Line_281	THE WOMAN HE HAD HITHERTWO KNOWNE HAD BEN MAINELY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLOD IN MISSUS LWNES SISTER
Line_282	ALIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRADE
Line_283	SHE HAD EIRECTED IT INTO A SORT OF ROUL OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFED AFTER ALL
Line_284	IF IT HAD BEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANDSOME MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHS SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HER SUCH A SUFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
Line_285	RANSON WAS SPLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT DREMIDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
Line_286	THE STATE OF MISSUSCIPY SNG TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPARE SO HE SURENDERED THE REMNENCE OF HIS PATRIMONEY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT KNEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ELIGTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN KNEW YORK IN THE COSTUM OF HIS PROVIENCE WITH FIFTY DOWLOERS IN HIS POCKET AND A KNOWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
Line_287	OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWET TO HER THUT WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAY'S COSTD HER TEARS HEAD AKES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACCUTIMATION AND IT WAS OH POSSIBLE BASER RANDSOME WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
Line_288	MISS CHANSELAR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VIGHTALE SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE AFOW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM T SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
Line_289	IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE SCOUTON STAPS TO CONSILIATE THE SHRINKING
Line_290	RASE THIS COUNDAD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND KNAMES
Line_291	ON RETANSULAR RONGDADE HOW MISSUS THINDER WOULD TREET THAT BRANCHOF THE QUESTION
Line_292	HAD WANTS TO BE KNEAR TO THEM TO HEOLP THEM
Line_293	WOULD HAVE BEEN MOCE SIMPATHY FOR RIFOLLEM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTOIN WISHING THAT RIFOLENES WERE A NITTL DIFERENT

Line_295	IT WAS NOE CLING TO CHOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GRATE REPRESENTATTIVE OF THE INCANSCHISEMENT OF THER SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
Line_296	SH WISHED TO WARK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEN PRE OCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCS OF THE PEOPLE
Line_297	HOW DID THE LADIY'S AN BEKONSTRETE FEAL ABOUT THE BAETS
Line_298	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTOIN HIROK AND IT WAS KNOT ROCK MISSUS FOWINDOR'S SURPELSD SO THAT THERE WAS A WONT OF PRESPECTIVE IN TAWKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRSY
Line_299	THEY WERE HIS SISTEORS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DEILIVERY HAD DOLNED
Line_300	THIS MIGHT SIMOAN OF THE MOST ECESIBLE OF PLEASURS BUT INPOINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SAL
Line_301	THAT WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMIN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PARTE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING KNO BETTER FATE THAN TO DY FOR IT

Line_2436	HE REASONWHLY THE FROUT IS EMTYED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EIRTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACET OF THE FROT ACTS UPON THE COPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
Line_2437	IN ALL THE OPORATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERBING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBET UNLESS THE GAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESARY
Line_2438	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LIMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
Line_2439	THAT THEY MAY KEP IT AS NECESSARY KNOHT TO BE SPEARING OF SHGER FIFTEEN O THRE
Line_2440	BEFORE SHGER WAS IN OUSE HUNEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PERSERVE MANY VEGITABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUCSE OF THE SHGER KANME
Line_2441	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY EQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION IND CONSCIDERABLE EXPERIENCE

Line_2447	THOUSAND AND WORNE ORNMENTLE DISHES THAT ADDORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOLD BE PERCHOCED FROM THE CONFECTIONAR THEY CAN KNOT PROFRABLY BE MADE AT HOME
Line_2448	THE EXPENCE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SHGER IS A SERIOUS SOUBJECTION FOR ECEPT A SHGER IS YUSED IN CONCIDERABLE QUALITIES TO SUCESS IS VERY UNSCERTAIN
Line_2449	THE SPADAL IS GENERALY MADE OF COPER CEPT BRIGHT AND CLEN
Line_2450	MARMOLADS GMS AND FRUTPASTSE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE KNOW IN VERY GENORAL QUEST
Line_2451	HEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPASTE OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING F THESE SUBSTANCES DUBLING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PREVOKE INDISPOSITION
Line_2452	IN SPEKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT AL THE VERIOUS PREPORATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VERIOUS FROUTS FLOWERS ERBSUS AND JUSES WHICH OENE BOILED WITH SHOGER WERE FORMALLY EMPLOIED IN FARMASY AS WELL AS FOR SWET MEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATANWARD COMFERSAY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TURME CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWET FD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUSIN

Line_2557	SHE WOULD APPEARE HERSELF AT DESERT AND THE BANQUHET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOWUER

Line_316	WITH OUT GOWING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASIYLY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AND INFLOENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPALES OF ACTION IND MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CARACTERE OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIAD OF INFENCY AND CHILD HOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
Line_317	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIATSA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINEALY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING AL THE THINGS ON THE FLOROF THE PIATSA INSTEAD OF PUTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
Line_318	SO SAYING SHE LEAD THE WAY ON TIPTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROM AND ROWUND BY A CRCUITOUS ROT TO THE PIASA THERE
Line_319	I AM VERY GLAD
Line_320	NOWDILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLOUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DALS
Line_321	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODS OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL ORE RATHER OF YELDING TO THEIR INFLOENCE ARE SPECIALLY YOUSEFUL
Line_322	THEY WERE KNOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DALS IN THE PARLOR
Line_323	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
Line_324	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
Line_325	PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL KNOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
Line_326	YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA ANDELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANESTAL TO MAKE ROSILLY A VISIT
Line_327	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAY THINGS SE
Line_328	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEN A GOD GIRL JANE
Line_329	AND THIS METHOD OF TRETING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOIDE COMITING A SIMOLAR FALT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADRESSED PERSONALY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
Line_330	DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSOEN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
Line_331	DILLIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MISTORY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSILLY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
Line_332	FORE LIKE AS NOT THEY MOUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINTCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
Line_333	AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HAL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN COUPS AND GOLDEN PLATS IN LONG ROS
Line_334	AND SHE TOK ANDER'S HAND AND WAKED WITH HIM UP THE BROD MARBLE STEAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIARS IN SILK AND VELVET STOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
Line_335	IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOWE YOU COULD KNOT LK ANY KNICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE READ CAP
Line_336	BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A CKINGS GOLDEAN CROWNE HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
Line_337	HE WAS SUCH A BI BOY THAT HE WORE HIGY BOTS AND CARIED A GACK KNIFE
Line_338	HE MADE A BOW SO DEAP THAT HIS BACK CAME KNEAR BRAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS KNOBODY BUT ANDERS
Line_339	WITH ONE JUMP ANTERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
Line_340	HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
Line_341	SEING THAT I AM SO FINDE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
Line_342	SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
Line_343	YES WHY KNOT THOUGHT ANDERS
Line_344	THE PRINCES SAT DOWN UNDER A BLU CANAPPY WITH BOCAD'S OF ROSES AND SHELET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
Line_345	ANDER'S FACE GROW RED
Line_346	AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
Line_347	I AM GOING TO THE COURT BAL ANSERED ANDERS
Line_348	BUT ANDERS CARED KNOTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_349	HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_350	BUT HIS MOTHER HUGED HIM CLOSE
Line_351	WELL BUT KNOW SAID THE PRINCES AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH KAKES AND PUT HER ONE HEAVY GOLD CHAINE AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
Line_352	AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARNE AND SHE KNITID IT HERSELF AND EVERY BODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
Line_353	KNOW MY LITLE SON SHE SAID
Line_354	ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PRIMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND READ WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
Line_355	NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDED ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SON AS ONE HADS A GACK NIFE
Line_356	THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
Line_357	BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAG IT OFF
Line_358	HE DARTED LAKE AND ARO THROGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACCROSS THE YARD
Line_359	THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
Line_360	THE MOTHER AS SON AS THE CHACE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MERY CAN KNO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONTINENCE GOSE AWAY FROM THE DOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLASENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INJENUITY AND SUCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFISE
Line_361	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SINS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOME WHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTILL WE ARE GONE
Line_362	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO ADE IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESINE
Line_363	THE THRE MODS OF MANAGEMENT
Line_364	THE MOTHER IN MANNAGING THE CASE IN THISS WAY RELIY'S PARTLY ON CONVINCSING THEIR REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
Line_365	AS THE CHACE DRIVES AWAY MEMRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DORSTEP HER MIND IN A TMOULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRIED OF THE DOCTORE DISTRUST AND SUSPITION OF HER MOTHER DISSAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SIRGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELLIKATE ORGANISATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELLOPMENT OF THE SOL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPARABLE INJURY
Line_366	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPALE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
Line_367	IT IS INDED TROUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SCILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF COULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIRE AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERATED
Line_368	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
Line_369	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND KNOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU

Line_726	MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELLIMENTS OF THE PRISOCRETIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMEIS
Line_727	PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENEABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
Line_728	THEY WERE OBSORBED IN HIS THIOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREATE AND TROULY CORECTORISTIC IN HIM HIS EFORT TO REAALIE IN CONECT OABSTRACTIONS WAS KNOT UNDERSTOD BY THEM AT ALL
Line_729	WITH HERACOLITIS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PRPETUAL FLUXS LIKE AN EXCEGORIS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINENTCS OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITING AN ELIMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHEGORIGIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MISTORY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
Line_730	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DILOTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESID'S THE TUTRILIGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
Line_731	AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSYNESS IN THE TIMS OF PLATOW WHICH CARACTORISES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POWIM OF LACRICIS
Line_732	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEIST TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEVED BY HIM AT DIFEREN'T TIMES OF HIS LIFE
Line_733	THE STIL AND PLEN OF THE TIMEIS DIFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIOLOKCTS
Line_734	HE PASSES ABBROUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONEMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES AR RATHER DOES NOT DESTINGWUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT PIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND HIS DREAMING OF JIOMEATRICAL PFIGURS LOST IN A FLUDS OF SENCE
Line_735	THE DIALOB IS PRIMARILY CONSURNED WITH THE ANIMAL CRIEATION INCLODING UNDER THIS TURM THE HEVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
Line_736	BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRUTATION OF PLATOL AND IN SPIRITE THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
Line_737	HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE STILE BUT KNOT IN ANOTHER IN THE GRIK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOFER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
Line_738	THE FANCIES OF THE NEADL PLATTONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXIBITD A FASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVALED WIDELY IN THE FIRST SENTORIES OF THE CRISTION ERA AND IS NOT HOLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
Line_739	THE IDEAS ALSO REMANE BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TIPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
Line_740	IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOFER IS TO BE INTURPUTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
Line_741	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET TO FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERITORY WHICH LIYE'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEADISIN AND MATHOMATICXS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT TERE WAS AS GREATE AN INPIETY IN RINKING THERIES OF PHYSICXS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFOR THE SOL
Line_742	IN THE SUPPOSED DEAPTHS OF THIS DIOLOG THE NEADL PLATONISTS FOUND HIDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JUISH AND CRISTION SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELISITED DOCTRINS QUITE AT VERIEANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
Line_743	BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGWAGE SEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLY GIVEN UP
Line_744	THERE IS KNO DANGERE OF THE MODERN COMENTATORES ON THE TIMEAUS FALLING INTO THE OBSERDITIES OF THE NEDOW PLATONISTS
Line_745	THE INFLOENCE WHICH THE TIMS HAS EXURSISED UPON POSTERITY IS DOBED PARTLY TO A MISS UNDERSTANDING
Line_746	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAG
Line_747	THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SICOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECOURD
Line_748	FAMILIARITY IS A FELLING CAPABLE OF DEGRECE
Line_749	A FIRTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
Line_750	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACUORISY OF A MEMORY IMEAGE MUST IN FUNDOMENTAL CASES BE BACSED UPON A CARACTORISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
Line_751	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPALE IS LIABLE TO ECEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TROTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEM MORE CORECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROCCIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
Line_752	I CAN SET TO WORK KNOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BRECFOUST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
Line_753	THUS IF I RECOGNISE A THING THE OCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTANCE IN VERTU OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFONITION RECOGNITION WIL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
Line_754	IT IS BY KNO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ELUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPENING KNOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
Line_755	IN AN IMEADGE OF A WELL NOWNE FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FELL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THISS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEFE IN THE ACURISY OF THE FAMILLIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UN FAMILIAR PARTS
Line_756	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THERY OF MEMORY MUST ARIVE AT
Line_757	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALY THOUGH PERHAPS KNOT QUITE CORECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS KNO ANOLOGE IN OUR NOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFONITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLIM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONSERNED THOGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIASY
Line_758	SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENCATIONS FELL VERY FAMILLIAR WHI'LE OTHERS FELL STRANGE
Line_759	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT ACCURANCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
Line_760	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFERENCE BETWEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_761	THIS NOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCE THOUG IN ANOTHER IT IS NOTT
Line_762	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CARACTORISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFARING TO MORE OR LESS REMOATE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
Line_763	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
Line_764	AL THAT I AM DOING IS TO YUSE ITS LOGICAL TUNABIITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALLOCIS OF WHAT ACCURS WHENE WE REMEMBER
Line_765	THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILLITY IN THE HIPOTHOCIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTS AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLY UNREAL PAST
Line_766	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUTLESS VERIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCURE IN GIVING US THE FLLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOATNESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
Line_767	SYMNS TWO BKS MENTIONED IN AN ARLYEAR LECTURE DO NOT TUTCH NOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
Line_768	THERE MAY BE A SPEIPHIC FLLING WHICH COLD BE CALLD THE FLLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONSURNED
Line_769	THE DEFONITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKXS OF WHICH THE VERIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
Line_770	THUS KNO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FELLING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
Line_771	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGEMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENCE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THISS FIRST SENCE OF THE WORD
Line_772	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMEGES THAT ARE BY KNO MEAN'S PECULIARLY VAE WHICH YET WE DO KNOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLOUENCE OF FATIGE WE MAY SE A FRINDS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORIBLY DESTORTED
Line_773	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ACCURANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEFE THAT THESE IMAGES REFR TO PAST ACCURANCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTS NOLEDGE MEMORY
Line_774	A GRAMAFONE BY THE HELP OF SUTABLE RECOURDS MIGHT RELAT TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMAFONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
Line_775	IT WOULD SEM THAT ONLY RATHER REACENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACURATELY BY MEANS OF FELLINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FELLINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSCENTRAL PART IN THE PROSCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_776	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADIQUEATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVELE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY KNO MEANS PRIMTIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELLIMMENTORY ACCURANCE AS  RECOGNITION
Line_777	RECOGNITION IN THIS SENCE DOUS NOT NECESSARILY ENVALVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ESOSCIATION THE CIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEING AT THE MOMENT IS ESOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN ODITORY IMEAGE OF PURING OR WHATEVER OTHER CARACTORISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
Line_778	WHAT IS CALLD PERSEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL IENGRIEDIEAENTS BRING UP HEBITTUAL ESOSCIATES IMEAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORLETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDESTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
Line_779	THIS DESTINCTION IS VIGHTALE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARY OUT IN PRACTISE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THERY
Line_780	IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
Line_781	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEGE THE WHOLE PROBLM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
Line_782	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUN'T OF RECOGNITION IS INADIQUECT TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
Line_783	I COME KNOW TO THE OTHER CARACTORISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUN'T FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_784	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECIGHTE A POIM DOUS NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
Line_785	THE ANALOCIS OF NOWLEDGE WILL OCUPY US UNTILL THE END OF THE THIRTTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFICLT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
Line_786	THE FIRST OF OUR VAGE BUT INDUBITIBLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS NOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_787	BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN IMPFORENCE IS WARENTED
Line_788	HABIT IS A CONSEPT INVALVING THE ACCURANCE OF SIMOLAR EVENTS AT DIFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FELLS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A FHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASURS HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
Line_789	WHENEVER THE SENCE OF FAMILIARITY ACCURS WITHOUT A DEFENATE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SERCH THE ENVIRMENT UNTILL WE ARE SATTISFYGDE THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILLIAR
Line_790	IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ATCHIVED AND IT IS A MORE ORLESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ATCHIVED BY MEANDS AND METHOUDS THAT COMEND THEMSELVES THRO THE GREATE ECONOMIC LAW OF VOICTND EFFHORT
Line_791	THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEEDHE COMONLY DOS BUT WITH A STIL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVLES OF INDEGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMBS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDRIN VIRTUALLY SEE TO CONSUME VALLABLE GODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIERTUALY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY
Line_792	CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELLEMENT IN THE STANDERD OF LIVING IN THE CITTYS THAN IN THE CONTRY
Line_793	THERE IS KNO CLASS IN KNO COUNTRY THAT HAS YELDED SO OBJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESURE OF PHYSICALL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES  ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIER OR SPIRITUAL KNED
Line_794	THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILLITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSCIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
Line_795	IN THE COMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDLE CLASS
Line_796	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
Line_797	IT IS ALSO KNOTICABLE THAT THE SRVICIBILITY VE CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELLIMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BESTS IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILLITY OF THE POPPULATION IS GREATEST
Line_798	THE DEPENDANT WHO WAS FIRST DELIGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PIRSONS BY WHOME THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTIMARLY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NAROS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
Line_799	IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESANT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGHTENING THE UTILITIVE CONSPICUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEASUR
Line_800	EACH WIL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EAQUALLY WELL DURING THE IRLIEAR STAGES OF SOCIAL GROTH
Line_801	THE MODERN ORGANISATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE

Line_805	BUT AS WE DECEND THE SOCIAL SCAILE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARLAS LEASURE AND CONSCUMPTION DEVALVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
Line_806	THERE IS A MOROLES ELABARATE SISTOME OF RANK AND GRATES
Line_807	THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT  BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINU TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
Line_808	WHENEVER AS IN THESE CACES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIMARY LEASURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES A REFLECTED ON ARIFPHIC CARACTOR
Line_809	THE WEARING OF YUNIFORMS ORD LIVEARIES IMPLYES A CONSIDERABLE DEGRE OF DEPENDANCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
Line_810	IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUGURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEASUR CLASS
Line_811	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEASUR CLASS ARE KNOBLE SUCH AS GOVERMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOTRIMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENCIVELY PREDITORY EMPLOYMENTS
Line_812	SUCH CONSUMTION AS FALLSE THRO THE WIMAN IS MEARLY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUD LABOR AND NOT THE CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
Line_813	DRUNKNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FRE USE OF STIMULENTE THEREFOR TEND IN THEIRE TURN TO BECOME UNORIPHIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
Line_814	THE YUTILLITY OF CONSUMTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASED AS A JERIVITY OF  GROATH
Line_815	IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DESSED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEACH AS A SINNENIM FOR KNOBLE OR GENTAL
Line_816	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRASY OF LESS DEGR HAVE IN TURN ATTATCHED TO THE PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMOR IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS AT CETTERA
Line_817	THE CONSEMPTION OF LUGURIES IN THE TRUE SENCE IS A CONSEMTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMOR HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER

Line_822	THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WMAND'S S TRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARIFORINAILIA IS AN OBVIOUS ECEPTION TO THIS RUL BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THISS ACEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANSCIAL
Line_823	THE WEARORS OF YUNIFORMS AND LIVARIES MAY BE REFLY DEIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FRE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IEGNOBLE
Line_824	WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIORCAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL ROULLE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT ON BINDING THAT WIMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFHITE OF THEIR MASTERS
Line_825	BUT THE GENERAL DESTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLKED
Line_826	MANY OF THESE AFILLIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEASUR ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESS A MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN TEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARSLY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTCIALLY TO BERATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMARS

Line_1226	YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALEAY
Line_1227	THE KING SEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
Line_1228	HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TO MUCH GRACE KNOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CACE AT THE PREASAN'T MOMENT
Line_1229	MASIURE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID KNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
Line_1230	SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAGIUSTIE'S MOST DEVOATED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORME A SERVICE ON THIS OCASION WITH SIMOULAR SEALE THAT HE AS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTL
Line_1231	THE SEASONS ALLIDES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A CUADRIL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMENSEMENT OF THE DANCE
Line_1232	THE KING WHO HAD FROME THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPALE DANCSER IN THE QUADRIAL CASTD A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVALE
Line_1233	WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUICE
Line_1234	BY DEGREES AL HIS HAPIYNESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSCIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASYNESS SOH THAT HIS LIMS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDS AND HIS HEAD DROPED AS THOGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
Line_1235	DISTAINFUL OF A SUCESS OF WHICH MADAM SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF KNOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGANING THE MARKAD PREFORENCE OF THE PRINCESS
Line_1236	YOUR MAGIESTIE'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFEAIR IS
Line_1237	THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE REPIDITY OF LIHTENING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COCKEATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
Line_1238	YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASUR
Line_1239	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBEAR HAD BEN LISSTONING AT THE DOR FOR THE PERPOSE OF KEPING HIMSELF ALCORAUNT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
Line_1240	BUT IN THISS VINNET COPED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
Line_1241	HE KOWS THEM BOTH
Line_1242	BUT KNOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YO WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNEAR DROW IT AT ALL
Line_1243	THE BROWN GROWN BENIEATH IS LEFT FORTHE MOST PART ONE TUTCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TOWO DEICATE LINS OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TUTCH OF WHIGHT DRAW'S THE INER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
Line_1244	THEY ARE BEYOND AL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR TEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUD TONES TEIR FAVERIT CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING ITHER DAHN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIFLY OUT OF GREAY PAPER
Line_1245	IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
Line_1246	MY FIRST IMPRINCIPALE REASON WAS THAT THEY INFORSED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COMPY THEM THIS METHOUD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HEW SIDE BY SIDE
Line_1247	SEE THAT YOURE LES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOYS CLIMING FOR HIS INTANGLED CIGT
Line_1248	EXCQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVIERSAL WITH ETURNAL LIFE AND LIGHTE THIS IS THE FATH AND EFFORT OF THE SCOLS OF CRISTOL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITTORALLY BY TAKING ANY VIERSES OF CHASOR IN HIS TENDER MODE IND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
Line_1249	BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEATY WHICH YOU SEK IN IMAGINATION
Line_1250	EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWSE PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIKED COMPLETELY
Line_1251	ONELY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOD IN FIRE
Line_1252	THOUS IN CHASER'S DREAME
Line_1253	THEY YOUNIGHT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YO ILL FIND ME REFIRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS KARISCURISTS
Line_1254	NOW YOU WILL SE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HEARMONISED WITH THE OTHER HEUWS IT BECOMES SOME HOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PERLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FILD OF UNTRETED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIMANDS AN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JULS IF THEY ARE GRIDATED JUSTLY
Line_1255	IT WILL BE WHOLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPOR AND PFILISITY OF FATH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLES YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOATING THE FPILISITY AND PIACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
Line_1256	EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTOR TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEMINGLY NEGLEGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATOF CALMNESS WHICH MAKS THESE TWO EJHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUAL WORK OF HOLBINE OR DUR
Line_1257	THERE'S ONE AN THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
Line_1258	IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARIT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTUE OF CARPATIAS ONE OF HIS SERIS F THE LIFE OF SANT JEORGE
Line_1259	WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNERS GRIEK SCOL OF THE HIEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DESPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STIRNEST INTILECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1260	BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DEVISION AND WHILE THE CURASCURIST DEVOATS HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGRIEES OF FORSE AND ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DEVISIONS OF LIGHT
Line_1261	NOW HERE IS ROUHIOW EXACTLY BETWEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWNE LEAFE BY LEAFE WHOLY FORMAL BUT BEATIFUL MISTE COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTAENCE
Line_1262	IT HAS NO BEATY WHAT SO EVER KNO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESKNESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND PORE

Line_1265	YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALY SPEAKING OF FOR MEN TITION HOLBINE TURNER AND TINTCORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TIURMS
Line_1266	THIS AT ONCE COMPELLES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEARIST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING GJULOERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
Line_1267	DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCOL IS AN EASY ONE
Line_1268	IN ALL ERTHLY GOTHICK ART INDEED YOU IL FIND FALLIOR OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DESTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDED REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
Line_1269	THAT A STILE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVEARE DOS NOT MEAEN THAT IT IS ALSO ERONIOUS
Line_1270	FOR BELIEAVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THER OPPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK RABN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLAHT TO BE GREAN AND THE BEST SCKI OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEASING ON THE MANNIFUL DELITIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEASED BY PROCISION OF INSTENTANIOUS TUCH
Line_1271	IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLLORTLISTS WIL YOSE HIS UT MOST FORCE OF COLLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTU IS IN BOTH CACES ALWAY'S IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS

Line_1274	SOME OF THE TUTCHES INDED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRISTOLISE HARD AT THE EDGE

Line_1278	NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORSE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AD MORE EVERY OUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TO GETHER LITTLE AN GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
Line_1279	THE LAW OF THAT SCOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEN CLEARLY OR ATLEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELLIMENTORY PRACTIS OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND

Line_2144	I HEARD A NOYSE BEHIND I TURND AND SAW CAFFAR HIS BLACK YES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING NIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HERLD HIM FROME ME
Line_2145	KNO WORDS WERE SPOKEN KNO LANGUIEDGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISING AND THAT SOME HOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
Line_2146	A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
Line_2147	MY TONG REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEACH LEAFT ME
Line_2148	NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RISK TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTATCHED
Line_2149	NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
Line_2150	A SOUND OF VOICSES A FLASH OF LIGHT
Line_2151	A FELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHEAIRE
Line_2152	WHAT WAS THAT

Line_2155	I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TO GETHER
Line_2156	I HAD AGAIN BEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLOUENCE OF THIS MAND'S POWER
Line_2157	PERCHANCE TWO CAFFER'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOD STEAD
Line_2158	THE STORY OF ITS EAVIL INFLOUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TROTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
Line_2159	I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE FANTOME BUT GRADUALLY MY APPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CAFAR
Line_2160	FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED KNOTHING DISTINCTLY
Line_2161	BUT THAT IS CAFAR'S KNIFE
Line_2162	MY OVER ROUGHT NEIRVES YELDED AT LAST
Line_2163	WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DIESTINCTLY ON THE SIRFACE OF THE POND
Line_2164	PRESCRIBED BY THE SIVILE AND ECLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONTISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY INTO MIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACNOWLEDGED THE GURISTICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
Line_2165	THEY ASERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXSOLTATION THAT THE APPISTOLICAL SUCESSION WAS INTERUPTED THAT AL THE BISHOPS OF YOUROUP AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CANTADGIOAN OF GILT AND SKISUM AND THAT THE PEROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHERCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFERICAN BELIVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VILATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FATH AND DISSEPLIN
Line_2166	BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVLEAGE WAS SON VILATED WITH THE NOWLEDGE OF TROTH THE EMPOR EMBIBED THE MACIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHERCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPTH OF CRISTIANITY
Line_2167	CONSTANTN EASILY BELIVED THAT THE HERITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DESPUTE HIS OPPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMANDS WERE GILTY OF THE MOST OBSRD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINASY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SIVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPY MEAN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
Line_2168	THE GRATEFUL PPLAUS OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO ENDOULGED THEIR PASIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTREST
Line_2169	THE EDICT OF MOLAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLORATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDGUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVOLEAGE OF CHOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
Line_2170	SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EADICTS OF DIECLIATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLADED BY THE SAME BISHIOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEDED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
Line_2171	BISHOPS VERGIANS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFENTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISKGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENNENTS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DOMATISTS
Line_2172	A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATELY SOED TOGETHER
Line_2173	AT THE FOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNSKCINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILCINS THE PATH DEVIDED
Line_2174	I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGALUGHTE LAGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONNISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICLT TO EXPLAINE
Line_2175	OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN AL HIS LIFE
Line_2176	I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOMED TO MY HOME
Line_2177	HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINEY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINCLED WHEN HE MOVED
Line_2178	WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONLYIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELYIER PLACE
Line_2179	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROKEAD MAJITION WHOME HE HAD KNEVER SEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEAIGHBOR
Line_2180	NO ONE WOULD DESTERB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FORIST WHI'E THEY WERE GOHNE
Line_2181	THE WOMAN SEMED THOUGHTFUL
Line_2182	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLD A CRASY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
Line_2183	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AS IN WHICH THEY LIVED
Line_2184	AND YOU MOUST BE O JO THE UN LUCKY SHE ADED
Line_2185	AT THE EMOALD CITTY WHERE OUR PRINCESS ASMA LIVES GREN IS THE POPULAR COLLOAR
Line_2186	AT ONE END STOD A GREAT FIRPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOAG WAS BLASING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR CETTLES IN A ROW AL BUBLING AND STEMING AT A GREAT RATE
Line_2187	UNK NOCKED AT THE DOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALLIMP BL OPENED IT AND GRETED THE VISITERS WITH A SMILE
Line_2188	I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOD JOABE I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL COUBERD AND THROUW OPEN THE DORS
Line_2189	YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
Line_2190	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT KNONE UNK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AIHT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNSCKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
Line_2191	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICSELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOLD NOT BE PROUWD NOR HOTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
Line_2192	BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COKE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
Line_2193	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POUDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGALOT WHO WANTS TO YOUS SOME OF IT FOR A PERPOS OF HER OWN
Line_2194	HE WARE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOUE NEAEPANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLOUE RUFLED WASTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHTE BLOE BRATED WITH GOLD
Line_2195	INSTEAD OF SHOS THE OLD MAN WARE BOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFTS OF GOLD BRADE
Line_2196	IEM AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF ARS
Line_2197	THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE O JO THE UN LUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
Line_2198	I THINK THE NEXT CLASS CAT THE MAJITION MAKES WILL HAVE NITHER BRAINS KNOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME YOUSE TO US
Line_2199	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
Line_2200	YOU SEE I'VE LIVED AL MY LIFE WITH UNK NUNKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ON TO TELL ME ANYTHING
Line_2201	THE FIRST LOGHT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CHAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
Line_2202	YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALUT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEET THAT MY HUSBAND FULLISHLY GAVE AWAY AL THE POUDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBY THE WITCH WHO YOUSED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLCINS TO THE KNORTH ON HERE
Line_2203	WHEN THEY WERE OUT SIDE UNK SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
Line_2204	WERE TRAVELING REPLID OJO AND WE STOP THAT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
Line_2205	WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALOUGHT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SCERVANT WITH TO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDOPENDENT AND HIY AND MIGHTY AND FELL ABOVE HER WORK
Line_2206	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPER BOCXS TOP SO THAT THE POUDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLS
Line_2207	OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POUDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFEAR AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CAN NOT HAVE TO MUCH CLEVERNESS
Line_2208	GOLD IS THE MOST COMON MEADLE IN THE LAND OF ARS AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
Line_2209	THE WISERD OF AURS WHO YOUSED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KEW KNO MAGICK AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND IM TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETY GOD WISERD BUT HE IS KEARELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORSORISE
Line_2210	MOST PEOPLE TALK TO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEFE TO FIND ONE WHO TALKES TO LITTLE
Line_2211	DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOCXS YOURE GETTING TO BE HUNK REMARKED THE MAJITION WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
Line_2212	SHE RAN TO HER HUSBOND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFTD THE FOR CETTLS FROM THE FIRE
Line_2213	IT TRULY ISS ASCERTED THE MAJITION
Line_2214	THE HEAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEATE BRAD'S
Line_2215	I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
Line_2216	OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVENCE WITH WONDER
Line_2217	SHE PORED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTELS
Line_2218	MARGOLUD HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORKE SCIRT AND AN APROEN WITH POCKETS IN IT OUSING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
Line_2219	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAJGITION REMOVED THIS POUDER PLACING IT ALLTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPONE
Line_2220	I AM NOT ALOWD TO PERFORME MAGICK EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITERS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROKED STEMB AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
Line_2221	NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINES EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
Line_2222	ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
Line_2223	THE HEAD OF THE PATCH WORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
Line_2224	I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEADED IN A SERVANT
Line_2225	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR AL WERE LOOKING AT THE POUTER OF LIFE BUT SON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE COUBEARD
Line_2226	THEIR CONTENCS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH CETTL A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POUDER
Line_2227	LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMENTARY ONGOULATIONS
Line_2228	WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LOTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKETE WIL YOU DO IT
Line_2229	IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LTHOR ADRESSD TO HIS STUDAENTS IN THE COURSE OF GOLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANOUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
Line_2230	A WORD SHOULD KNOW BE SAID ABOUT THE OREGIN OF LUTHOR'S COMENTORY ANGOULATIONS
Line_2231	IT WAS RITEN IN LATAIN
Line_2232	THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICLT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
Line_2233	BUT THE ESSENCE OF LOTHOR'S LECTURS IS THERE
Line_2234	THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENCED
Line_2235	THE CONDITION IS THAT I WIL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LOTHOR TALK AMERICAN STREAMELINE HIM SO TO SPEK BECAUSE YO W'L NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LOTHORIN CHERCH ACTUALY TO READ LOTHOR UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
Line_2236	THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
Line_2237	MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTERIN MY GOLATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
Line_2238	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOKE TO
Line_2239	IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHOR'S RIGHTINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CRISTIANITY THE GJUSTIFICATION OF THE SINER FOR THE SAKE OF CRISTS MERITS ALONE
Line_2240	BY HIS RESERECTION CRIST WONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVLE DEATH HELL AND EVERY EAVEL
Line_2241	THAT CRIST IS VERY GOD IS A PARENT IN THAT PAL ESCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EAQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DESPENDE GRACE AND PEACE
Line_2242	OTHERWISE PALL SHOULD HAVE RITEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD GESUS CRICST
Line_2243	PALL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINNESTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
Line_2244	PALL ANSERS THE MAN WHO HAS NAMED GIESUS CRIST AND THE SONE OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2245	ALL THOGH THE BRETHERIN WITH ME ARE KNOT APPOSSAL'S LIKE MYSELF YET THEY RE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
Line_2246	WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
Line_2247	NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PATIA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
Line_2248	THIS SHULD GO FAR IN SHUTING THE MOUTHS TO THE FOLSE OPPOSALS
Line_2249	INDED HE PERSEUTED THE CHERCH OF CRIST FOR A LONG TIME
Line_2250	NOT ALL THE GOLATIONS HAD BECOME PRVERTED
Line_2251	THE GREATING OF THE APPOSCAL IS REFRESSHING
Line_2252	NOT FOR A CROWNE OR A KINGDOME  OR OUR GDNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
Line_2253	AGAINST THESE BOASTING FOLSE APPOSLE'S PALL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APPISTOLLIC ATHORITY AND MINISTRY
Line_2254	THE VICIOUS CARACTER OF SIN IS BROGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2255	AT THE SAME TIME POLE CONFIRMES OUR CREED THAT CRIST IS VERY GOD
Line_2256	THEY REMAIND DEVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPPINION
Line_2257	THESE PREVERTERS OF THE RICIOUSNESS OF CRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
Line_2258	AS THE AMBACITER OF A GOVERMENT IS ONNOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND KNOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRIST SHOULD EXSULT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN ATHORTY AMONG MEN
Line_2259	AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RACED HIM FROM THE DEAD
Line_2260	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGIEL'S CAN NOT
Line_2261	I DID NOT THEN REALIE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINIUSTRY
Line_2262	HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPACE OF HIS OPPISTAL
Line_2263	DID NOT CRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TROTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMEATH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
Line_2264	WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
Line_2265	PALE CAME LATER IN HIS BENIETH US
Line_2266	BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
Line_2267	THIS IS KNO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLY PRIDE
Line_2268	THEY SAID TO THE GOLATIONS YOU HAVE KNO RIGHT TO THINK HILY OF PALL
Line_2269	WE ARE TO HEARE CRIST WO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHERE
Line_2270	THE EARIANS TOOK CRICTE FOR A KNOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGIELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EIRTH
Line_2271	HOW MAY WE OBTAINE REMITION OF OUR SINS
Line_2272	ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE KNOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DISPARE
Line_2273	DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LTHERIN HERITICS WOLD DISS OWNE HIS ENTIRE CHERCH
Line_2274	MEAN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
Line_2275	THE TUERMS OF GRACE AND PICE RE COMON TURMS WITH PALL AND ARE KNOW PRETY WELL UNDERSTOOD
Line_2276	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PALL WAS MAKING TO MUCH OF HIS CALL
Line_2277	THE GREAT NESS OF THE RANDSOME CRISTE THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
Line_2278	AND ALL THE BRETHERON WHICH ARE WITH ME
Line_2279	SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APPISTAL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREATING OF THE APPOSTAL VIRSE THRE
Line_2280	WHEREVER THE MANS OF GRACE RE FOUND THERE IS THE WHOLLY CHERCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICRIST RAINS THERE
Line_2281	PLE STICKS TO HIS THEAMB
Line_2282	EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATUE OF GOD
Line_2283	BUT THE REAL SGNIFICENCE AND COMFORT F THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
Line_2284	IN THIS WHOL APPISTLE PALL TRETS OF THE RESEORECTION OF CRICST
Line_2285	PAL AND APPOSSLE NOT OF MEN AT CETTERA
Line_2286	THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPALE PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CRISTIOANS ARE
Line_2287	I KEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRIN OF FATH BECAUE WE WERE TAUGHT SOFISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOD SPIRITUAL BOSTING
Line_2288	IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDER MINDE THE ATHORITY OF SANT PALL
Line_2289	GRACE INVALVES THE REMITION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
Line_2290	THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEAN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
Line_2291	TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOWLORABLE WHEN WE SEK TO MEASUR AND TO COMPREHEND HIS IMFINATE MAGISTY
Line_2292	WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APPART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
Line_2293	THIS ATTITUDE IS OUNIVERSAL AND PARTICULY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
Line_2294	HE MENTIONED THE APPOSCAL'S FIRST BECAUS THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
Line_2295	WHY DO THEY NOT INVAIDE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTORIN TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOUPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
Line_2296	UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR TEY ARE FULL OF COMPFORT FOR SOR CONSCIENCES
Line_2297	HE CAME DOWN TO EIRTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFERED WAS CROUSIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYE'S MAY FASTON UPON HIM
Line_2298	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAME IS TAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
Line_2299	THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOL WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENS FOR A SINGLE SIN
Line_2300	EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
Line_2301	MAHOMAD ALSO SPAKS HIGLY OF CRIST
Line_2302	FOR A PERSON TO POSESS NOWEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
Line_2303	SINCE CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY COULD KNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFORTS
Line_2304	THIS ATITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FOULSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMAL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOD CONSCIONCS THAT WE MUST FEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEL THAT CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
Line_2305	EITHER HE CALL'S MINISTORS THROGH THE AGIENCY OF MEN OR HE CALS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALED THE PROPHETS AND APPOALES
Line_2306	THE WORLD BRANS THIS A PRENICIOUS DOCTERIN
Line_2307	IT SPOILES OND'S BEST WORK
Line_2308	HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIACE OF GOD WILL
Line_2309	FIRST TO
Line_2310	BUT CALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIHTELY
Line_2311	THE CLAS SEMED SUPERFOLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
Line_2312	GRACE BETO YOU IN PEACSE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD GESUS CRIST
Line_2313	PALL DECLARE'S THAT THE FOLSE APPOSLS WERE CALLD HER SENT NEITHER BY MAN NORE BY MAN
Line_2314	HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CRIST
Line_2315	WE LOK FOR THAT REWORD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEN NOR ER HEARD KNEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN

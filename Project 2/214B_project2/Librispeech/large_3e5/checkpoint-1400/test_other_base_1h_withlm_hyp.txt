Line_198	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YO VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
Line_199	SHE ANSERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
Line_200	OH NOW ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCE COME THIS WAY
Line_201	WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
Line_202	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
Line_203	BEG PARDON IS THE ULSKEBRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
Line_204	HAD THE DOCTOR BEGAN SIENTIPICALY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCE AS AN ECEPTIONAY INTELIGANT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCE AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
Line_205	THE PRINCE WAS DESTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SENT AGAINST KITTY
Line_206	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEAREFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEARFUL
Line_207	HE ASKED AH IT IS
Line_208	BEFORE HER HE DESIDED TO SCATTER HIS PURLS
Line_209	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FAT SAID THE PRINCE TELL ME EVERYTHING
Line_210	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPALE PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
Line_211	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
Line_212	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
Line_213	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WIL W SOON BE INSUITION AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTONS MEAN THEY FELL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCRECED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
Line_214	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCRECE OF DISADVANTAGES
Line_215	AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBOROUS NATIONS IS MENT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFISCIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
Line_216	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPAR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DECENTIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFY'S ITSELF
Line_217	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDANT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
Line_218	GOVERMENT ASSERT THAT ARMS ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
Line_219	THE MATING OF KAPPRIVIYS SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUEGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREN FOS BUT TO BY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINSTHE INSLAVED TOILING MASSES
Line_220	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF E STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEAS FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
Line_221	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DESPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
Line_222	EVERY INCRECE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECT BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATS AND CALLS FOR A SIMOLAR INCRECE IN THEIR ARMS
Line_223	THE TACES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPORATIONS OBSORBE THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
Line_224	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINS OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WELTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSER
Line_225	AND SO EVERY GOVERMENT NEADS AN ARM ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BATY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGNDS
Line_226	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ECENCUALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPS ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GARDS AND MAKE THE RUIN ATHORITIES OF TADAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUTS SO THAT THE REGUMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGUMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
Line_227	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
Line_228	BUT CHAMPIANS F THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF ATHORITY THAT IS OF VILENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLOUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
Line_229	SO THAT THE JUSTIFIATION OF STATE VILENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR SENTOURIES AGO HAS NONE WHAT EVER NOW
Line_230	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENCE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIABOR
Line_231	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDERDS OF MORALS AN THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VILENCE THE EXISTANCE OF AN ATHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VILENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VILENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CAN NOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LAST
Line_232	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDGUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIPE WITH NEIGHBORS
Line_233	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAND THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSESSION OF POWER SOCIAL ORGANISATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
Line_234	IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBEARITY OF STRIPE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSETORIANISTS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFORANCE OF THE AM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
Line_235	THE RIVALERY OF THE YURAPIAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORSES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSED THE UNIVERSALE MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDGIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE
Line_236	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASE OF POWER
Line_237	THE GREAT EXTENTION OF MEANS F COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AE IN FORMING SU CIETIES ESSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESES FOR SINTIPIC ECONOMIC AND PLITICAL OBJECTS
Line_238	THE GOVERMNT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATS WHO MIGHT INSLAVE US
Line_239	WITH OUT GOVERMENTS KNATIONS WIL BE ENSLAVED BY THIR NEIGHBORS
Line_240	THE DESPATISM OF THE GOVERMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCESSES AND THE OGRESSIVENESS OF E GOVERMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTRNAL DESPATISM
Line_241	AND THEREFORE THE PRESSION OF THE OPPRESSTE ALWAYS GOWS ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LEM BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WIT THE GOLDENEKXS
Line_242	THIS ARGUMENT WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME SENTORIS AGO
Line_243	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF HIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCK WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVS OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
Line_244	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHER WS
Line_245	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CEASERS TO THE RUSHIAN AND GERMAN EMPARARS TAKE MORE INTREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT FATS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
Line_246	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLOENCE ACTS IN ACCORDENCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRS
Line_247	GOVERMT ATHORITY EVEN IF IT DOS SUPPRESS PRIVATE VILENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VILENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER INPROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERMENT
Line_248	THE BASES OF ATHORITY IS BODY VILENCE
Line_249	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BRAKE OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIALIGHE VAN AND FRUTLESS
Line_250	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EGUCATION CULTURLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
Line_251	THE POSSIBILITY OF APLYING BODOLY VILANCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANISATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISEN IN SUBMITION TO ONE WILL
Line_252	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WAGING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATS NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE AT IT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DOMANDS AND SERVE N THE ARMY WOOD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEUS THAN TO REFUS TO DO SO
Line_253	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE ATHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS ANDTHE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
Line_254	THE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE THAT COMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VILENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITISONS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
Line_255	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
Line_256	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CROULTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSUCURITY OF EXISTANCE ARE CALLD UPON TO FACE ALL THE PEROLS THEY HAD MET TO AVOID
Line_257	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
Line_258	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
Line_259	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL SITISINS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE ENIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL SITISINS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
Line_260	INTERNAL DESCENTIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF PRESSION EXERTED BY THE ATHORITY OVER THE DSCINTIAN INDIVIDGUALS
Line_261	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COUD THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION BE JUSTIFIED
Line_262	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLLANTARALLY SACREFICE THEIR OWN INTREST FOR THE ENTREST OF THE GROUP
Line_263	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUT THE ARMY
Line_264	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
Line_265	BUT THE FAITAL SUGNIFICENCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVIS AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRODICTION INHEARANT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARANT IN THAT
Line_266	FOOT NOT THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE BUSES OF ATHORITE EXIST INSPIGHT F THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROPS NOT ONLY FAILES TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
Line_267	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
Line_268	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGOUS AS MONTASCW POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
Line_269	WE KNOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CAN NOT DEMINNISH THEIR NUMBER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRMENT AND MORAL INFLOUENCE
Line_270	BUT THE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERMENT THERE OTHER GOVERMENTS EXPLOTINGTHEIR SUBJECTS BY VILENC IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERMENT AND CARRY OF THE FRUTS OF THE TOILE OF ITS INSLAVED SUBJECTS
Line_271	BUT THIS GUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
Line_272	THIS INCONSISTANCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
Line_273	THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SUCURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
Line_274	POR RANDSOM ANOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BEOTION AS AT THAT MOMENT
Line_275	HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST TEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS BEAR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRULTY OF DEFETS
Line_276	HE WAS TO SIMPLE TO MISSIPPIANE FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISSAPPOINTED
Line_277	IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BALLS AND RANDSOME HAD RITTEN IN ANSURING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HISPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
Line_278	SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMORATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPORTUNITY
Line_279	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER RIGHTING TO BAR RANDSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY ECEPTIONALY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASURED HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HEAR THE FIRST TIME HIS BISNESS HE WAS BEGINING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTOIN
Line_280	HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGICK
Line_281	THE WOMAN HE HAD HITHERTWO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THE EXIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLOD IN MISSUS LWNES SISTER
Line_282	ALIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
Line_283	SHE HAD DIRECTED IT INTO A SORT OF ROLL OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
Line_284	IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANDSOME MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASSCERTAINING HER SUCH A SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
Line_285	RANSON WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT DREMIDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
Line_286	THE STATE ON MISSUSCIPY SUN TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPARE SO HE SURENDERED THE REMNENCE OF HIS PATRIMONEY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ELITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUM OF HIS PROVENCE WITH FIFTY DOORS IN HIS POCKET AND A KNOWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
Line_287	OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER TU WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEAD AKES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACCUTIMATION AND IT WAS OH POSSIBLE BAR RANDSOME WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
Line_288	MISS CHANSELAR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM T SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
Line_289	IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE OUT N STOPS TO CONSILIATE THE SHRINKING
Line_290	RAISE THIS COUNDAD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
Line_291	ON RETANSULAR RONGDADE HOW MISSUS THINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCHOF THE QUESTION
Line_292	HAD WANTS TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
Line_293	WOULD HAVE BEEN MOE SIMPATHY FOR RIFOLLEM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT RIFOLENES WERE A NITL DIFERENT
Line_294	THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRIED CAUSE THIS WOULD THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLATION IT WAS TRIOUMPTH IT WAS SOL THERE EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BROCIAL BLOOD STAINED RAVEONING RACE THE LOST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
Line_295	IT WAS NONE CLING TO CHOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GRATE REPRESENTATTIVE OF THE INCANSCHISEMENT OF THEIR SE FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
Line_296	SH WISHED TO WARK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PRE OCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCS OF THE PEOPLE
Line_297	HOW DID THE LADIES AND BEKONSTRETE FELL ABOUT THE BAT
Line_298	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTOIN HIROK AND IT WAS NOT ROCK MISSUS FOWINDOR'S SURPELSD SO THAT THERE WAS A WONT OF PRESPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRISY
Line_299	THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DEILIVERY HAD DOLNED
Line_300	THIS MIGHT SIMON OF THE MOST ECESIBLE OF PLEASURS BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SAL
Line_301	THAT WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMIN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PART OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DYE FOR IT
Line_302	SAID LIFE CHANSOULAR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEED FOR A REMISTIONEUS RESPONSIVILITY
Line_303	THE UNHAPPINESS OF WIMEN
Line_304	IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MAR SUCH A SACREFICE OF THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SOLD A MUTHERE THOU A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST O THE NATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSE WIN SUCCESS
Line_305	CHARLEY WAS A YONG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLOR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LUSTER NICE THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
Line_306	A HAVE HEATED DEAR THAT FINE AVINEOW TALKED AT OUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
Line_307	WHEN MISS BIRDS Y APPROACHED IT TRANS FIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POR LITTLE HUMANITORY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARSTER
Line_308	AND LOOK AFTER THE DEATAILES AS WELL AS THE BOOK CURRENTS MISSUS FAMINDER ADDED IN A TON AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WORTH E SMILE OF WHICH THE SWETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LINER
Line_309	OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEARLE TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
Line_310	OLIVE CHANSIOLAR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG N REWARDED WARY LIVE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
Line_311	PERHAPS SHE COULD SLEEP FOR THEM MO TILE SOME OTHERS
Line_312	A ALL SORTS OF INFEARIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS SOINDER WHOD LIVED AT RSBORY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THENCE UP
Line_313	SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SIMPATHY IT HAD CRUMBLED HER INTO AS MANY CRECESES AN OLD GLASED DESTENDED GLOVE
Line_314	IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MARDORA
Line_315	THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOLDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GRATE AMERICAN STATSMAN ALL ON THE OTHER HAND PUT MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALADAMA
Line_316	ONE DIDN'T EVENT KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOOL
Line_317	SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
Line_318	THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH ALIVE SHE NEVER ONE THROUGH ANY FILM
Line_319	HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE ACCULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WIDE HAND TO HER VISITER HER REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LWNERS INDISCRESSION THAT HE WAS INTENSLY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTENCE
Line_320	NOW I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE

Line_322	BESIDES I LIFTDIDN'T WONT HEAR IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROG THE FORM OF SELLING SAL
Line_323	SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RANDSOME A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
Line_324	HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LINE WITH INTELIGENT INCREDULITY
Line_325	ARE YOU VERY AMBITCIOUS YOU'D LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
Line_326	SHE HATES IT SHE WOLD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
Line_327	MISSUS LOWNEYS FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSOLER THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WE GOT UP FOR A S VOEAGE
Line_328	HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGH OUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLOR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRYANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAIST COAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL READ STONE
Line_329	SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATER
Line_330	THOSE OF BAL RANDSOME WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CALACTOR OF ELIVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS TATTUR IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDITIAL BENCH OR PILITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRON'S MEADLE
Line_331	HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANSOLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERLY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXEARTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
Line_332	THIS LOST REMARK HE MADE THAT RVENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOATED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LILINA
Line_333	HAVE YOU BEEN IN YURUP
Line_334	AND MISSUS LINEAR ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
Line_335	AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGLY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRATE BRIM
Line_336	INSPIGHT OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED PRE IT PORAS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FIN HEARD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
Line_337	AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRED TO REATHE WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTRETED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONTINENCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GILTY ELIGIANCES AND INTERPULATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOUSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SOULTERY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICON IN ITS RICH BASKING TON SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TOOMING EXPOUNDS OF THE COTTINFIELD
Line_338	THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTRESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS THE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PACHES
Line_339	WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE OLD WITCHES AND WISERDS MEDIAMS AND SPIRITRAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS

Line_796	MEANWHILE CURNAL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BIS'Y MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARSY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEDINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSER
Line_797	THE CURNAL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
Line_798	LARGE BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
Line_799	SO KING GOT BAL WHO PUT IT UP

Line_804	AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
Line_805	BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DOFFENCE
Line_806	THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARSY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JULER WAS TRIED
Line_807	I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE VE MISSED YOU
Line_808	I BE YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONS HE KNOW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE YOUSE OF LATE

Line_821	STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
Line_822	GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITITIONS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFAY
Line_823	THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARGE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECOS OF THE WEADING CHIMBS HAD DID AWAY HE HAD BEN TO TREAT HIS WIFE FOR TH REFIND CROUALTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLICK UNDERNEATH HIS HABITTUAL MAER THERE WAS THE RAW NESS OF THE BROUT
Line_824	ITS ITS AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JULRY STOR SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSER
Line_825	THEY STOPPED CLOAK FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
Line_826	I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT I WILL TAKE TIME
Line_827	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARGE STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL OBUSE DO YOU ASKED THE CURNAL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
Line_828	AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT SINTHIA RETHFORD HAD MARRIED

Line_839	THEY TOOK HERY AWAY WHILE AGO
Line_840	IT HAD A DUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
Line_841	FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BORE TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
Line_842	TIME WERE AT ONCE A WEAK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THER LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WIMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
Line_843	IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SIDNY OFTEN CALLED TI HIS VALCATION CAME AND A VALLUMINOUS CORSPONDANCE WITH PAY BEGILED THE LONG DAYS
Line_844	BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORYS MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY VERIDE
Line_845	IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THUT FANY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMORATION OF POLLY'S LOYIALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL OBSOBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVOLATION TO FANNEY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOSTE OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECT TO FRLOUSE WITH ALMOST AS MUCH CORNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSS THE FORTONS OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
Line_846	I HOPE MARIA BAL ITS ALL NE THINK SOR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
Line_847	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BISNESS WAS IT SURFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TO WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BREAD IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCETED CITY IN KNEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HELTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLOENCES OF THE WEST TO VIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
Line_848	PRE PARLE WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
Line_849	IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TO WARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE SERTAINLY SUCEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR INSPIGHT OF MANY FAILORS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SEENS THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSEFREND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTOUN MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
Line_850	IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDOW FROM THE LAST OR BOTH THE GIRLS
Line_851	FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPORATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECT OF HEARTS
Line_852	CRID POLLIVEWTH THE HEARTYEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE

Line_861	SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAYS WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREMING OF A BOOK OR SIN ALONE THAN TO EXCERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHARS
Line_862	SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOE JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A CHANOR AWAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
Line_863	BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BAR THINGS SOME HOW ANSERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER

Line_888	UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
Line_889	HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROWD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
Line_890	MINY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED YOU WAS A PITION SO SHE COULD PALE IN THE POLES AND NOT FU ABOUT RABARS
Line_891	THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE WORSE ANSERED POLLY
Line_892	HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO KCLAD TO SEE HER TITCHY HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MEAT

Line_895	TROULY TROULY FAN
Line_896	SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRINKNESS WAS SO AGREABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
Line_897	THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INTOUSITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMTATION WHICH CAME IN A GISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPISE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
Line_898	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSFUL FACE AND SHE WAOKED ONE FEELING THAT THE FIRST ANDPEPSED THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
Line_899	JUST SOPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOS ASK ME AND I SAY YES
Line_900	CHILLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
Line_901	WHAT A SPIGHTFUL THING I AM

Line_907	A FISH LITTLE SPEACH TO MAKE TO A DARK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
Line_908	NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEAK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DACHING REFORM HAD SUBSCIDED SHE MISSED THE BLESS LITTLE INTERVIUWS THAT YOUSED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVER OF ROMANS INTO HER DULL HEART WORKING DAYS
Line_909	I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS BOVE ACCOMPLISH MENTS OPPOSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUTLES POSESSED A GREATER INFLOUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
Line_910	BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASURE YOU THAT SHE DOES EMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MENTHER FOOTS THOGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENCE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
Line_911	IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MAN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED BOTH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
Line_912	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COCET IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSION BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TO TRANSPONET AND STRAT FORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WIDE LIKE LEVELLY
Line_913	LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TO WARDS PARLY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
Line_914	THE CHIEF ORGANISR RANG OF

Line_924	WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
Line_925	IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMITY ROOMS AT NEMSIS
Line_926	OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FELL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERMENTS POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXCURSISE OF CLEMANCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
Line_927	HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADRABUS IN TO NIGHT
Line_928	THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARSORATING GOVERMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBEART HALL

Line_1839	JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLOD A LITTLE ANOYANCE
Line_1840	AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THY WERE POR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PAIL OF HIS SIMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRN NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
Line_1841	REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS

Line_1859	WELL BITSY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1860	NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
Line_1861	MARGRET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD

Line_1863	ALL HIS FORMAL FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSIERS THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DIS OUST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WELTH
Line_1864	I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
Line_1865	AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MIST THOURNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KIND NESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT

Line_2362	THE TO ME AND THEM STOVES WERE DROPPED
Line_2363	ASKED VORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YOUNGKERS

Line_2370	HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
Line_2371	AND THUS THEY GJERNEYED ON WARDS A LONG LONG WAY
Line_2372	NOW THEN SAID THE FULL DUST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2373	THE CHE BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND SINDERLADS SET OUT ON HIS WAY
Line_2374	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THOUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN ARRIS DUST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
Line_2375	THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISHED HIS BROTHER
Line_2376	HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
Line_2377	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCE SAID CINDERLAD
Line_2378	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOLDS RUN WERE THEY CHOSE AND SETED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HA
Line_2379	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SYNDELAD
Line_2380	THE YOUTHE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
Line_2381	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LAD
Line_2382	WHEN HE HAD RONE AFTER THE FOODS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE DISTIF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
Line_2383	YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YUSE
Line_2384	THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FULL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
Line_2385	SIMMERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITURE AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WHALE THE SORD WITH PERFECT ES
Line_2386	FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCES WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TO WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
Line_2387	WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEON FOLDS ASKED THE KING
Line_2388	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL SAID DUST THOU SEE ANYTHING
Line_2389	THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
Line_2390	BUT SIGORD WAITED TIL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
Line_2391	THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLD ATER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWORF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASUR AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
Line_2392	SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW D YOU KNOW WHEN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE OURS ARE WARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
Line_2393	ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWORP WAR AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
Line_2394	SO SIGOULD PUT THE HEART OF FAR ON A STAKE AND ROSTED IT
Line_2395	G THOUGH FAINER AND TEN FAINER DIED
Line_2396	FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
Line_2397	THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELLD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILL SLAPS
Line_2398	ONCE UPON A TIME THE WAS A KING N THE NORTH WHO HAD ONE MANY WORSE BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
Line_2399	THEN SIGRD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGN
Line_2400	THEN SIR ROAD AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUTER
Line_2401	SIR SAID I WOULD TUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DYE
Line_2402	THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE JRAGOAN HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROD ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
Line_2403	THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
Line_2404	THERE IS SIGARD ROASTING FAINER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOME
Line_2405	BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SERCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAINE AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HELD
Line_2406	WINBORNEHLL'S FATHER TOLD GUER THAT SHE WOULD MAY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RID THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHERTHEY ROAD AND GUER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
Line_2407	NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SORDS STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
Line_2408	THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
Line_2409	BUT ALL MEN DYE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
Line_2410	FOR ONE DAY WHEN BURENHILDEN GUNDRIEN WERE BATHING BURNHELD WATE FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRIEN SUPERIOR
Line_2411	SO REGN MADE A SORD AND SIR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW AND A LUMP OF IRN AND THE SORD BROKE
Line_2412	SO SIR SAID THAT SORD WOULD DO
Line_2413	THEN SIR ROD BACK AND MET RIGIN AND REGN ASKED HIM TO ROSE FANER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
Line_2414	HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER GAIN SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
Line_2415	THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SUREY SHE I SWARE THE VOW FEARLESS OF BRAKING
Line_2416	BUT WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAWT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FEATHERS AND COLD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
Line_2417	LEAVE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HAST HE CLID AND SET FORTH FROM THE KINGS PALLIS
Line_2418	CIS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
Line_2419	THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BOROWED A BRUSH AND BROUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROP DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DOHNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
Line_2420	ON THE FIRST THIRSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITION OF THE PALIS AND BED THE KITION MADE WHO SLEPT THERE TO LUENT ER A BRUSH
Line_2421	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PIECE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO ARN HIS OWN BREAD
Line_2422	THERE WAS ONCE ONE TO TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
Line_2423	I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
Line_2424	WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
Line_2425	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
Line_2426	SHE BEED VERY PRITILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
Line_2427	AT LAST THEY CAME INSIDE OF LAND
Line_2428	OUT ON THE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KINGS SIDE ON SAND END STONES MY BEAD I MAKE AND MY BROTHER'S SLAPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITTED AND UNWEAPTD
Line_2429	NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIIOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
Line_2430	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASCKET INTO THE S
Line_2431	THE SHAPE OF THE DISSHES VERIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASSION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
Line_2432	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SKUMB THAT HAS RISEN
Line_2433	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICSES AND DESERT DISHES
Line_2434	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCESSIVELY SCIMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR YOUSE
Line_2435	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON PORES OUT LIKE OIL
Line_2436	THE REASONWHLY THE FROUT IS EMTYED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN ERTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACET OF THE FROT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
Line_2437	IN ALL THE OPORATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERBING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
Line_2438	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LIMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
Line_2439	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPEARING OF SHOGER FIFTEEN O THREE
Line_2440	BEFORE SHOGER WAS IN USE HUNEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGITABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE DUE OF THE SHOGER CAME
Line_2441	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERBLE EXPERIENCE
Line_2442	YES
Line_2443	AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTS ICES ARE SCARSLY TO BE DISPENCED WITH
Line_2444	MARMALATS AND GEMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTANCY MADE BY BOILING THE PUMP OF FRUTS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SHOGER
Line_2445	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE ER AND APPLID TO THE THUMB THE TENASSITY OF THE CROP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFORD A THREAD WHICH IT SHORTLY BRAKES THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
Line_2446	FROUT GATHERED IN WATE OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILLDUED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
Line_2447	THOUSAND AND WORN ORNAMENTLE DISHES THAT ADDORN THE TABLES OF THE WELTHY SHOULD BE PERCHOCED FROM THE CONFECTIONAR THEY CAN NOT PROFEABLY BE MADE AT HOME
Line_2448	THE EXPENCE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SHGER IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SHOGER IS USED IN CONCIDERABLE QUALITIES TO SUCCESS IS VERY UNSCERTAIN
Line_2449	THE SPADAL IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER CEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
Line_2450	MARMOLADS GMS AND FRUTPASTSE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE KNOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST
Line_2451	HEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPASTE OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING F THESE SUBSTANCES DUBLING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PREVOKE INDISPOSITION
Line_2452	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VERIOUS PREPORATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VERIOUS FROUTS FLOWERS ERBSUS AND JUSES WHICH ONE BOILED WITH SHOGER WERE FORMALLY EMPLOIED IN FARMASY AS WELL AS FOR SWEET MEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATANWARD COMPERSAY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TURME CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUSIN
Line_2453	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
Line_2454	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A CAVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POUTERD SHOGER BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY RETURNED
Line_2455	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FOUTS BY CUROP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
Line_2456	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
Line_2457	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GORGES FABULOUS SUMBS WERE ALTON EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS
Line_2458	YES SAW SHE SHORELY WAS PLUMB SCARED
Line_2459	ANY WAY HE WOULD FIND OUT
Line_2460	ONE DAY THIS KNOW COUNT CHIFULING COUSEN OF GRAND P BUSERD GET COLD IN HIS FEET
Line_2461	SO WEORNSSTD ON THE CHIMNY TOPS WHENEVER OLD JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAD NO BISNESS
Line_2462	THEY LIKE TO CHOKE THAT NO CONBUSER TO DEATH
Line_2463	WHEN HE GET HOME HELD TRY AND TRY TO BUSH THIS ST OFF BUT IT DON'T GET INTO THE SKIN AND IF STAY THERE
Line_2464	WHY HE JUST STRETCH HIS FULL HEAD AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AND LISTEN AND RUSTOEN
Line_2465	OLD MISTER BUSEARD GRIND
Line_2466	KNOW ALL MISTER BUSERD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMIDATING AND WHEN PEATER BAGE SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
Line_2467	IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROGS
Line_2468	HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED CUSEN OF OLD MISTER BUSERDE VERY CURIOUS INDEED
Line_2469	WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDPOP BUSERD HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DUN FLYS SO HY HE SCORCHED THE FETHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSEN DID GRAMPOPP BUSERDE AND THIS COUSEN WAS JUST NATURALLY LADY AND NO COUCH
Line_2470	EVERY BODY LOOKED AT PATTER AND LAUGHED
Line_2471	WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFULING MEMBER OF THE BUSERD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT A MEAL IN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PEATER RABIT CAN AND ANY BODY THAT CAN DO THAT HE HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
Line_2472	LIKE MOST NO COUNT PEOPLE HE YOUSED TO MAKE A REGULAR KNOSCENCE OF HIMSELF POKING HIS KNOWS INTO EVERY BODY'S BISNESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
Line_2473	PLEASE MISTRIP BOUSRED PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BAGED
Line_2474	MUCH HE DON'T MIND THAT
Line_2475	WH YOU ALL PLEASE SPEAK A LE LOUDER HE HOLLER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT
Line_2476	IT WAS ON THE LOWER OLD HOUSE A LITER OLD TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE
Line_2477	THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
Line_2478	A LITTLE SH OF SATISFACTION WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
Line_2479	MARORIET TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THROW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFULE A SLIGHT CO PUT UP HER HANCERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
Line_2480	I FANCYED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
Line_2481	TROULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
Line_2482	WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVILESS CREATURE WHOSE FEAT I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATITSFID AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
Line_2483	NEVER DO HE GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LOCRATIVE
Line_2484	WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PROUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARIVE
Line_2485	I EMBRACED MARGORIETE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFULED
Line_2486	ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
Line_2487	DURING THIS REMARK MARGORITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
Line_2488	I LISTENED AND I GASED AT MARGORIETE WITH ADMORATION
Line_2489	HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
Line_2490	MARGORIETE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I ROAT TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MOROW IT WOULD KILL ME
Line_2491	IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
Line_2492	LOOK HERE PROUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGORIETE
Line_2493	WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
Line_2494	WE STAND FIRST AND THEIR SELF ESTEMED LAST IN THEIR STEM
Line_2495	IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THOUTURE
Line_2496	ON THE SLEEVE DO OU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
Line_2497	IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
Line_2498	I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND CISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
Line_2499	MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSIURED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
Line_2500	YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WON'T WONT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
Line_2501	MARGORIET DROW THE LETTUR FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINEATE SWETNESS SAID
Line_2502	WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
Line_2503	I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH SHE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
Line_2504	I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARRIS
Line_2505	SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLS
Line_2506	YOUR IN THE WAY MARGARIET BUT HOW
Line_2507	WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
Line_2508	WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
Line_2509	BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPITION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
Line_2510	HERE IT IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
Line_2511	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRDS ACT I HEARD A DOOR OF THE BOS ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPENED AND MARGORIET APPEARD
Line_2512	HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VOEVIL
Line_2513	THE MORE GIRL BELIAVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO AR LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE AS A TRIUMPTH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GARDED
Line_2514	THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WATE UNTIL I AWAKE
Line_2515	YES BUT IF I SHOOD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
Line_2516	WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAYETY
Line_2517	THEY LOVE BY PROFEION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
Line_2518	YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WHITY FACE
Line_2519	THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
Line_2520	BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO ENSPIRES THIS REDAMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH AND SOL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DROUT ALL EIRTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
Line_2521	NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND LOGORIE GET INTO THE CARRAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
Line_2522	BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MALARESONG
Line_2523	MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXCALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT

Line_1	WE POULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THERE AFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FRESIS
Line_2	AIDAS HEART WAS FILLED WITH RATH AS HE LOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHOWN AS A LEPPERDS EYES
Line_3	SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
Line_4	WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTYIEST OF THE HEROS OF GRECE
Line_5	AS THEY CAME TO THE CITTY A MIST FELL AND JACIEN AND HIS COMRADS WITH THE SONS OF FRICIS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN

Line_8	THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS POPLE SAID BEFORE THE MON HAD COME INTO THE SCKY
Line_9	THEN I SOD THE FUROWS NOT WITH THE SED THAT DMEATOR GIVES BUT WITH TEATH OF A DRAGN
Line_10	AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KEN IN A QUIAT VOICE JASION SAID
Line_11	SHE ENTERED SOTLY AND SHE STOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
Line_12	AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHAL GIVE YOU THE GOLDSLISE TO BEAR WAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIL OF YOU
Line_13	IT MAY BE THAT YO ARE TRUELY OF THE SCED OF THE IMORTALS
Line_14	THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
Line_15	FOR GJACION WAS THE GRAND SON OF CRETHIOUS AND CRETHIOUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATTHMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
Line_16	AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARDS HER IT WAS BEN CHACED BY A HOCK AND MEYA SAW THE HOCKS YES AND BEAK
Line_17	THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROWS WAS HE WONDER OF THE PALLISE IN THE BRIGHTE LIGHT OF THE MORNING
Line_18	ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTFOS THE SAR MATY
Line_19	HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRILE HE WOLD MAKE OF THEM
Line_20	BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I WONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY SITTY EMTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YEALD UHT TO ONE WHO CAN NOT SHOW HIMSELF HIS BRAVE
Line_21	FRANTIS AND MELL SWENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
Line_22	HE WITH HIS COMRADS WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
Line_23	AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MITIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
Line_24	IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLICSE
Line_25	I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROS ATAS IT IS
Line_26	AND MANY OF THE MAGITIONS OF EAGIPT WHO HAD COME WITH KAN SIOSTROUS STAYED IN THAT SITTY AVAA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLES SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MON IN HER GOWING AND COMING IN ARISING AND SEATTING

Line_28	WITH AN EAQUALL DEGRE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DYE ON THE WEAL AND ANOTHER IN THE BSOM OF HIS FAMILY
Line_29	FOR THESE ARE CAREFULE ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EAGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDET FROM WHOME THEY ARE ONLY DESTINGWISHED BY THE OBSERDITY OF THEIR MEANS

Line_31	WEAPING IS CCORDINGLY SIMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SIMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SORSE
Line_32	THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDGUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
Line_33	IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPPASIT FOR LOVE AND SIMPATHY AND ALSO PON IMAGINATION
Line_34	EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFEROER BY IMAGINATION OR SE IN HIS FATE THE LOHT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOGHT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEAP SIMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEL THIS SEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVEIRSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEAPING IN THE CACE OF DEATH
Line_35	FIRST OF AL HE CERTNLY WEAPS FOR THE FAT OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEAPS WIN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
Line_36	WE WHO HEARE SEK THE THEARY OF VEIRTU AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE KNATURE F THE KNOWEDGE WHICH LIE'S AT ITS FOUNDATION  WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVAY THAT KNOWEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
Line_37	THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
Line_38	HE SEES THAT THE DESTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULPH ONLY BLONGS TO A FLEADING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON

Line_41	FIRTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFARING THE INDIVIDJUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
Line_42	WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROGH OUR OWN SUFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
Line_43	HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEN AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUPER
Line_44	BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INNEVITABLE SIMPTM OF THAT NOWEDGE
Line_45	FORTHE INTREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMOARABLE MANIFESTATIONS CAN NOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCSENTRATED UPON ONE
Line_46	THEREFORE ALL THOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MAN KIND GENERALLY DOUS NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL N YET THE PERMINENT NOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BENS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND AVEN SERENTY OF DISPOSITION
Line_47	THE DEADS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDGUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
Line_48	IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIVED DOCTRIN OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALY MUCH WOLD BE GAINED THERE BY MOROALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOLD BE RESTRICTED
Line_49	THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPALES WHICH THEY GAVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VERTU AND LAWS WHICHU IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREDY BEEN SAID CAN NOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE KNO AUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETURNALY FRE WILL
Line_50	THE OPSET OF THE STEAME OF CONSCIONCE THE ORGIN AND SIGNIFICENCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOD CONSCIONCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DIS INTERESTED DED
Line_51	AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HARACOLIS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BISNESS OF THE GOD OF THEUNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UN DONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITH OUT BRINGNG ONE WITH HIM
Line_52	THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER E'S BLIRED AND ER HER NES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURT YARD ANDTHE HUSKS OF THE CORN IND HER MADED HAIR

Line_56	IT WAS NOT SO TERIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
Line_57	AND THEN HERACLIS FELT THAT ANOTHER LEABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
Line_58	AND AS FOR ADMETOS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND NELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCASTIS SADLANE AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
Line_59	IF ONE WILL GO WILINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO AT MEDIS
Line_60	THAT WAS BEFORE HAD MEDOWS SAILED ON THE ARGOE WITH GACSEN AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
Line_61	AFTERWARDS PEOPLE WONDERED AT AD MEDISES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERADIANT BN
Line_62	NOW THE FT STEPS SEMED TO STOP
Line_63	BUT APPOLLO TURNED TO ADMETTOS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_64	AT MIS AT METS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN IRTH

Line_66	THIS I  CANNOT DO SAID AD METIS IVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
Line_67	DATH WOULD SON BE HERE FOR HER
Line_68	THEN ATT MADOSE RAISED THE VALE OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS O THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
Line_69	IT IS FO ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO A MEADMEDICS AND MEDIS KNOW THAT EVEN KNOW THE GOD OF THUNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
Line_70	AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSCENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
Line_71	IVE DRAGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GARDS LOS WHOM DETHPBRNED SOWND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
Line_72	YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISS TO GO FORTH FROM THIS SAMPLE WITH OUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
Line_73	HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRENT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO AD METTS
Line_74	HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WONE HER FROM AN ENEMY
Line_75	HE LIFTED ALKESTS THROWN THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALLIS
Line_76	SHE WAS VALED AND ADMETTIS  COULD KNOT SE HER FEATURES
Line_77	NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALIS
Line_78	WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
Line_79	HE LEFT THE PALLIS OF ADMETTOS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
Line_80	ONE SHOULD GOW IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
Line_81	BUT STILL APPOLLOW STOOD BEFOREHIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
Line_82	AND WHAT A KNOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HOUSBAND
Line_83	NO MORE SPEACH CAME FROM HER
Line_84	THEN ADMETIS WENT INTO THE PALLIS AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LANDEWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE RETCHUD ONES ROND THE PALLISCSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
Line_85	A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND HAD MEOS KNEW THAT DIS WAS APPOLLOW COME TO HIM AGAIN
Line_86	AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONS IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONS
Line_87	BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HOROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
Line_88	THERE AFTER AT MEADOS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
Line_89	TO WHAT GOD DOS THAT SACRIFICE DO
Line_90	JUST A SATISFY ING I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS

Line_1295	ONE COULD REMEMBER POALM AFTER POALM OF HIS WITH A THME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SEARVED FOR MISTER HARDEY TO LATE CRISTNA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
Line_1296	HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDJERS ROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFATED OF THEIR GLORY

Line_1301	IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDAY'S POIMS ABOUT WAW ARE KNO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILLITY THAN HIS POIMS ABOUT LOVE
Line_1302	HOW LONG HE CRIYES IN A POME RITEN SOME YEARS AGO
Line_1303	AND PROSIN TROUDS IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES

Line_1310	BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GREAVE PARTS STEALS LETS PART ABID AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EAVE WITH THROBINGS OF NON TIDE
Line_1311	TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDAY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DAPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
Line_1312	HE DOUS NOT EXPRESS LIFHE EASILLY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
Line_1313	MISTER HARDEY HAS TO BITTER A SENCE OF REALLITY TO BELIDE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WARE
Line_1314	AND OUR WIVES QUATH ANOTHER RESINEDLY DOLE THEY ARN OUR DEDS

Line_1317	HE HAS A TEMPERMENT CENCITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW REACENT RIGHTERS TO THE PAIN AND PASION OF HUMAN BEINGS
Line_1318	THE MOD OF FATH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHTE IN THE MEMORY OF FATH IS NOT MISTER HARDAIY'S PREVAILING MOD

Line_1320	NOTHING OF TINEST BIRTH HAVE I ROUGHT PONTERED PLANED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAYS SINCE THE PALE CORKSLIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNETE BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULLE HUED DAYS
Line_1321	BUT PERHAPS HIS CARACTORISTIC ATITUD TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELLANCOY POME THE SOLS OF THE SLANME IN WHICH THE SOLS OF THE DEAD SOLDGIERS RETURND TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTIONE A SNIOUR SOLFLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELLITIVES HAVE CEPTD THEIR DOUTY DEADS IN REMEMBERANCE

Line_1325	HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARE'S THE MARK OF THIS TERIBLE CONFLICT
Line_1326	THAT IS WHY CRIM AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN AICORENNA OF FATHERS AND SONS
Line_1327	ON TWO OPOSITE PAGES OF THE ITDIETE ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CARACTER'S BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A PANTIN PRINCE ES AT ALADA EVENOVENA LISAVETTA PRCOPFIEVENA E GENY PVELOVITCH REDONSKY PRINCESS PEELAQUONSKY AGLAYA PRINCE MISKIN COULIA EVOLGN IPOLITE VYA FERDO SHENCO MISTARCIA PHILAPOVNA NENA ALEXANJIOVENA GUNIA TITSIN AND GENERAL EVOLGN

Line_1329	IF I HAVEN'T CILLED HIM I'L COME AGAIN AND CILL HIM
Line_1330	BUT THE SECRITE OF DOUSTIERSKIE'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOLTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CARRACTOERS
Line_1331	AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTAL MAKNESS SAINE ON THE IMAGES OF OLDS THE VONIC SAINTS
Line_1332	IT IS EASY TO SE WHY DOUSTEESKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR ATHOR
Line_1333	THE OULTERMATE ATTITUDE OF DOUSTESKY IS AS CRISTION AS THE APPOSTL PEATERS LORD I BELIEVE HELPD THOUN MYGN ON BELIFE
Line_1334	CERTANLY THE LOUST OF CROULTY THE LOUSTER DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTIONS SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOUSTEESKIES MAN AND WMAN
Line_1335	WAS VERY FOND OF HANING CUTS AND BARING THEM WITH GREAT SERIMONY
Line_1336	AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETABLE FRAGMENCS OF DILOG THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MAN TAVERN SET IN SUROUNDING DARKNESS
Line_1337	WE SIMPATHISE INDED WITH THE FEARS THE BRIVADO THE DESPARE THAT SUCAD THE CRIME
Line_1338	HIS CARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH GELLOSY OR FALL IN EPOLEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HISTERICALY

Line_1341	LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVAOLIST OF TORTCUR
Line_1342	MISTER MARY BOLDLY FACSES THE DIPICLTY AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFONITION
Line_1343	ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MOLTAPLICITY OF ACTION
Line_1344	NO MILLEGUMATIST EVER PORED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
Line_1345	SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DIMATRY BRETHLESSLY
Line_1346	AS FOR THE CARMSOVES THEMSELVES HE PERTRAYSE THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRIUTAL MANIACS

Line_1348	WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SETED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIL ORE AMONG VAGABONDS HE PASSED THEIR TIME BEGING BEFORE THE PRISON DORS
Line_1349	ULTERMATELY THEY ARE THE CRIEATIONS KNOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
Line_1350	AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMT DEVLKAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE

Line_1355	BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALNCE THEY ALWAYS IN DIMONICAL CONFLICT
Line_1356	AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPPATING THE NIGHT DOUSTESKY STILL SEES THE LIGHTE OF CRISTIAN COMPAION
Line_1357	IF DORLSTESKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAE BEEN STRINBER
Line_1358	TO HIM DOSTERISK HIS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGLE IT IS THE STRUGLE ITSELF

Line_1850	CRISTION WITH A RIGHT GOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
Line_1851	CKEP IN THE MISTER OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO VE
Line_1852	CRISTION SIR WHAT HOUSE IT THIS BERE REST HERE TO NIGHTE
Line_1853	HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREST OF HIS COATE AND GAVE THANKXS TO GOD
Line_1854	HE WENT ON THUSE TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THRY MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEP WITH CHAINGS ON THEIR FET
Line_1855	NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HIL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
Line_1856	WHEN WATCHFLE TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HAD COMED THIERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_1857	KNOW YOUR NOT THAT HE THAT COMES KNOT IN AT A DOR BUT CLIMES UP TO GEING THE SAME AS A THEFE
Line_1858	CRISTION SERS WHENS COME YOU AND WHERE DOUG TO GO
Line_1859	SUCH WAS THE LAHT OF THE JUS FOR THIR SN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RET S AND I AM MADETO TRADE THOSE STEPS WITH GREFE WHICH IN MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEN FOR THIS SLEAP
Line_1860	CRISTION WHAT MEANS THESE
Line_1861	I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOT OF THE HERL' OF DIFICALTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
Line_1862	AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHNE BONE OF AN AS WITH WHICH SENSEN DID SUCH RAYFETS AND THE SLANE AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DABITS SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
Line_1863	THEN YOUR NEACXT SAWHT A MADE COMIN TO LAY THE DUST SO HE SEME MADE CLEANG AND LAIDE LOWE BY FATHING THE BOK
Line_1864	THOSE DID QUESTION TALKE WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GRO DARK AND THEN HE TOK HIS REST INT LARGE ROM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PIECE THERE HE SLEAPD TOL BRAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SAID A HIM
Line_1865	CHARITY HAPYOR WIFE AND BABES CPRESUMED YES I HAVE
Line_1866	THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO CEPT THE LODGE OF THEAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CRISTION MADEA HED AS IF HE WOLD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS BY STRENGHE SO SMALL
Line_1867	THEY TOLD QUESTION THAT HE HAD KNO NEED FOR CARE ON THATSCORE FOR LONG YUWS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT HET HAD BEEN SILVER YEARS
Line_1868	THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET IT THE AIMOST TO MEAN THAT HE MIGT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
Line_1869	OBJECTION ONE IT WLD SEME THAT IN THE SENESENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
Line_1870	THEREFORE A SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
Line_1871	THEY WOULD NOUT HOWEVER ON THIS ACOUNT HAVE BEEN ACEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT KOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOS PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
Line_1872	KNOW WE MAY REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND KNOT OF A SUBJECT
Line_1873	THEREFORE IN THE STAITE OF INNESENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMOS
Line_1874	NOW WHAT EVER IS PART IS PATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ECENCIAL AND UNIVERSAL
Line_1875	THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INOSENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DESBAYD NOTHING DISABAID HIM THAT WAS KNATURALY SUBJECT TO HIM
Line_1876	IN A QUOLITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITH OUT ANY DEFACTIL NATURE
Line_1877	I ANSER THAT WE MOUST NEADS ADMITE THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARD'S SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPEND'S UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS KNORE WOULD SECTUL UNIN HAVE BEEN STERAL
Line_1878	SECONDLY DIS ASPROVED BY THE ORDER OF A DEIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWSS GOVERNES INFEARIAR THINGS BY THE SUPERIAR
Line_1879	THEREFORE IN THE STAT OF IMOSENCE MAN WOLD KNOW HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
Line_1880	FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
Line_1881	SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STAITE OF INEENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
Line_1882	THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODELY DESPEARITY
Line_1883	SO ALL ENIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENCE DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMAOLS OBAY HIM
Line_1884	OBJECTION ONE HIT WOLD SEM THAT IN THE STATE OF HIMESENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASED OVER MAN
Line_1885	THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEMS FETTING THE STATOF INSENCE MAN HAD NOT BEANIN OVER PLANS
Line_1886	MUCH LESS FERFORE WOUD THEY HAVE A BIT MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOSENCE
Line_1887	IN OTHER SENCE MASTERSHIP IS REFRED IN A GENERAL SENCE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENCE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FRE MEAN CAN BE CALD A MASTER
Line_1888	THIRDDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
Line_1889	AND BY VISACK WE KILLED OUR SOS AS WELL
Line_1890	SO THEY SET OF THROUGH THE FILD

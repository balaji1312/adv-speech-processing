Line_82	MISTER SOALMERS WAS SOMEWHAT OVER WELMED BY THIS FLUD OF INFORMATION
Line_83	HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DESTERBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTN OF HIS LIFE
Line_84	DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
Line_85	SO IT SEEMS TO ME
Line_86	YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
Line_87	MY S COLOR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
Line_88	I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
Line_89	THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
Line_90	HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE K IN THE DOOR
Line_91	O I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SURE
Line_92	ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SET THE MATTER QUIETELY AND DISCRETELY
Line_93	I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
Line_94	HOW LONG WULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOU OR NOT LESS
Line_95	THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
Line_96	AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOMS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
Line_97	ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
Line_98	I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO YOSE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
Line_99	WITH OUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CEMICLES AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDYNESS HE WAS AN INCOMFORTABLE MAN
Line_100	AS HOMES DROW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND AN ELERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
Line_101	LET US HERE THE SUSPIIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROFS
Line_102	THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGD TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE ONUSTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPITION
Line_103	THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
Line_104	THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEASED THE NEXT
Line_105	THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GIDE
Line_106	YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
Line_107	I WILL ENDEVER IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONSERNED
Line_108	I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOMS
Line_109	BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
Line_110	HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETRETE VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
Line_111	I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
Line_112	A BROKEN TIP OF LED WAS LYING THERE ALSO
Line_113	I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD CARD
Line_114	THE ALTURNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE K IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
Line_115	MY FRIENDS TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKERSTREET
Line_116	I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
Line_117	I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
Line_118	TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEFE THEY WERE ROLLED UP
Line_119	NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BO OF BLACK DO OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAUDUST IN IT
Line_120	NOW MISTER SOMS AT YOUR DISPOSAL

Line_124	AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
Line_125	ANY ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
Line_126	ONLY FOR A MINNET OR SO
Line_127	I DEARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UN LIKELY
Line_128	I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SINS HERE SAID HE
Line_129	ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPITION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
Line_130	WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTIS THERE ARE OTHERS
Line_131	HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
Line_132	DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
Line_133	THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRAIND HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
Line_134	WHAT COULD HE DO HE CUT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEALE HIMSELF
Line_135	THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MARS MACCLERIN
Line_136	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH A YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COLD NOW
Line_137	TO MOROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
Line_138	IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
Line_139	IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DELEMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE COLPRET TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCOLLORSHIP
Line_140	YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
Line_141	THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
Line_142	JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOMS
Line_143	HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY OUST MAN
Line_144	I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTINGS GOD BY

Line_148	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
Line_149	NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KI WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
Line_150	NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
Line_151	WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS

Line_160	NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT

Line_311	THAT IS COMPEARATIVELY NOTHING
Line_312	THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MAD IN CHILD HOOD
Line_313	NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
Line_314	THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VILENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
Line_315	VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLOUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
Line_316	WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AND INFLOENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPALES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CARACTERE OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIAD OF INFENCY AND CHILD HOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
Line_317	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIATSA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIATSA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
Line_318	SO SAYING SHE LEAD THE WAY ON TIPTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITS ROOT TO THE PIASA THERE
Line_319	I AM VERY GLAD
Line_320	NOWDILLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLOUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DALS
Line_321	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODS OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YELDING TO THEIR INFLOENCE ARE SPECIALY USEFUL
Line_322	THEY WERE KNOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DALS IN THE PARLOR
Line_323	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
Line_324	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
Line_325	PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
Line_326	YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA ANDELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANESTALL TO MAKE ROSILLY A VISIT
Line_327	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAY THINGS SEE
Line_328	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TON HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
Line_329	AND THIS METHOD OF TRETING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMITING A SIMOLAR FALT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
Line_330	DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COSOEN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
Line_331	DILLIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MISTORY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSILLY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
Line_332	FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
Line_333	AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HA A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATS IN LONG ROS
Line_334	AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HAS WHERE COURTIARS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
Line_335	IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOW YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE READ CAP
Line_336	BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KINGS GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
Line_337	HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOATS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
Line_338	HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BRAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
Line_339	WITH ONE JUMP ANTERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
Line_340	HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
Line_341	SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
Line_342	SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
Line_343	YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
Line_344	THE PRINCES SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANAPPY WITH BOCAD'S OF ROSES AND SHEET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
Line_345	ANDER'S FACE GROW RED
Line_346	AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTER'S STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
Line_347	I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSERED ANDERS
Line_348	BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_349	HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_350	BUT HIS MOTHER HUGED HIM CLOSE
Line_351	WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCES AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH KAKES AND PUT HER ONE HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
Line_352	AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITID IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
Line_353	KNOW MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
Line_354	ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PRIMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKE AND RED WIN SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
Line_355	NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDED ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HADS A JACK NIFE
Line_356	THE PRINCES CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
Line_357	BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TA IT OFF
Line_358	HE DARTED LAKE AND ARRO THROUGH ALL THE HAS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
Line_359	THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
Line_360	THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARRY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESION OF HER CONTINENCE GOSE AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLAENCSY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INJENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFISE
Line_361	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SINS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOME WHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
Line_362	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AD IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESINE
Line_363	THE THREE MODS OF MANAGEMENT
Line_364	THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THEIR REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
Line_365	AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MEMRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TOMOULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRIED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPITION OF HER MOTHER DISSAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SIRGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANISATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AND IRREPPARABLE INJURY
Line_366	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARRY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPALE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
Line_367	IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SCILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF COULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERATED
Line_368	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
Line_369	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
Line_370	BUT PHILLP IS ONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
Line_371	IF I GO TO MATING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND SHEARE THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
Line_372	WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANY WHERE ITS IN A BOX VALED AND PINENED AND SHOT IN BY DISABILITS
Line_373	FATHER THES UN JUST TO FHILLUP HE'S GOING INTO BISNESS
Line_374	AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEY DOS LEARN MEDISN
Line_375	I HOPE THE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THE LOVES MUSICK THE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
Line_376	IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICAPPOS
Line_377	IF I CAN GET PAINT
Line_378	AND IF I HAD A FORTON WOULD THEY WANT ME TO LEAD A YOUSELES LIFE
Line_379	ROTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIISTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MOSOLIM WITH ITS GREAT HAS AND ECOING ROOMS AND NO COMFTORBLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMIDATION OF ANY BODY
Line_380	MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEADISON
Line_381	WHERE THE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
Line_382	THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME ROUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
Line_383	HE DOUSN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT ITS SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTONS ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A KNEW COUNTRY
Line_384	SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANOW SAYING A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY MATALLIC VOICE AND THEN STING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ FILLOPS LETTER
Line_385	I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM ROTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
Line_386	THE SITESERS RETURNED IN HY SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
Line_387	ROTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE IN TENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
Line_388	WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
Line_389	I HEARD FATHER TELL CUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WIPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISOLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
Line_390	IT HAS OCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND IN THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONET
Line_391	IS THE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING ROTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS
Line_392	AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREET
Line_393	BUT THAT WISE AND PLASID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBLE A GREAT DEL BETTER THAN ROTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
Line_394	I WILL PRACTICE IT
Line_395	DOES THE THINK THE COULD STAND IT SIX MONTHS
Line_396	HAS THE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CARER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CARER OF THE WANTS
Line_397	SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
Line_398	I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DEMEURE PERSON
Line_399	AND THE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD Y
Line_400	IS THY FATHER WILLING THE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCALE OF THE WORLDS PEOPLE
Line_401	BUT NEITHER SAINT JERARD NOR BROADSTREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MENT NOR THE GLORIYS OF THE HALL WERE THE GOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SINING THE DECOLORATION IMPRESSED THE VISITERS SO MUCH AS THE SPLINDERS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON AITH STREET
Line_402	ROUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT FILLIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
Line_403	WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIANCE
Line_404	THE STUDY MEAN
Line_405	ITS SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLIKE LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LE IN THE CERBSTONE AND SCERADUS AS WE COME OUT
Line_406	THERE IT CERTAINLY WAS NO ENDTO IT AND EVEN ROTH WAS FILLADELPHIA EN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCTECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY Y COULD REST
Line_407	MARGRET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLOSCIDITY
Line_408	HE DOSN'T SAY BUT ITS ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLETE AS A WENSDAY MEETING UN IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
Line_409	I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOME
Line_410	PIP THEREFORE READ DILLEGENTLY IN THE ACTER LIBRARY PLAND LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPELL ATTENTION AND NEIRSE HIS GENIOUS
Line_411	THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALLSTREETE OFFICE OF HENRIY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPPORATER
Line_412	HE WAS UN ABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
Line_413	HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WIMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITER OF THE DAILY GRAPE VINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
Line_414	WHAT PHYLLP DID AFORD IT AND HE ROAT THINKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SKAM WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
Line_415	TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSE WHERE THE PATHS TO FORTON ARE INNUMORABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORISON
Line_416	IT IS SUCH A KNOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
Line_417	THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP IN WRITING LETTERS FOR FLIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
Line_418	ELL NEVER DIG IT OUT OF THE ATER LIBRERY
Line_419	OH VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
Line_420	HE HAS NO TRODITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULCE IS TO BRAKE AWAY FROM THE OCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A KNEWAY FOR HIMSELF
Line_421	AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
Line_422	I'VE BEEN READY TO GO ANY WERE FOR SIX MONTHS
Line_423	WHY ITS IN MASURY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WELL GET A MAP
Line_424	LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SINCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENCS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK AND THE ANT ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS RIGTING PHILLOP INVERIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISCUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTIS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE OTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDENT FESE
Line_425	SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPITIOUS POULPET AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPLE OF REPENTENTE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISTIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGTED REAGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTANGAL'S VOICE IS IN TON AND THE BULBL SINGS ON THE ONIGHTS
Line_426	THE MOST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THREST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LOUTENETS S TRAIN OR DOCTOR CAN

Line_449	AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMIS THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
Line_450	IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIAD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEAN SEE TO WORK
Line_451	I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTIN BAD LAKE TO TUTCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
Line_452	JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PREASES

Line_688	WOULD NOT THE LOGHTYEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
Line_689	IT MUST BE ONED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITORARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
Line_690	SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SOMET OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END

Line_692	LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
Line_693	ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEADING A DETATCHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUG AN INTRENCHMENT
Line_694	BENSOFS MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INSCESENTLY WERE SERVIDACXS EARS BESCEAGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPEAROLELLED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS AIGHTTEENTH OUR AUNDISML OF PERRIS THAT HE COULD SCARSLY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTERA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
Line_695	NO CATHIDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOSE ITSELF COULD VE WITH A CHERCH AT MONTMARTERA
Line_696	UN LIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENTION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXAUSTABLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN SICLOAPIDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANICDOTES AND TROPERS TAILS HE WAS MATCHLESS
Line_697	WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLORY OFFIORS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHERK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVLES PERSUTS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADACK BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
Line_698	THE BOND OF YOUNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND AL THOUGH BENSOFS ATCHIVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL ONOURS OR ANY PENCIONE THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPEARIOR OFFISOR

Line_712	FORE IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHINS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF SITS AND DID THE KNOBLEST DEADS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
Line_713	THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OTION
Line_714	SOME POIMS OF SOLLN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
Line_715	FOR AT THE PERROL OF HER OWN EXISTANCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELINS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVATER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLERS

Line_720	THE GENIALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RESITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANIMAL SOLEN ARE A MER CHILDREN'S STORY
Line_721	BUT IN EAGIPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
Line_722	LISTEN THEN SOCRITICSE TO A TALE OF SOLLENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF JROBITIS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TODED TO MY GRANDFATHER CRIDTIOUS AND HE TOLD ME
Line_723	NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF TH INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCOUSTOMED MAR
Line_724	THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RIDHEM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER YUSE OF POSITION AND MORE OF REPATITION THAN ACCURS IN PLAITOS AIRLYEAR RIGHTINGS
Line_725	BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MESTORY OVER HIS INSTRMENT WHICH HE EXIBITS INTHER THIDRIS OR SIMPOSIAM
Line_726	MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELLIMENTS OF THE PRISOCRETIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMES
Line_727	PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
Line_728	THEY WERE OBSORBED IN HIS THIOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TROULY CORECTORISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNECT OBSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
Line_729	WITH HERACOLITIS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PRPETUAL FLUXS LIKE AN EXCEGORIS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINENTCS OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITING AN ELIMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHEGORIGIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MISTORY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
Line_730	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DILOTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TUTRILIGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
Line_731	AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSYNESS IN THE TIMES OF PLATOW WHICH CARACTORISES THE PILOSOPHICAL POWIM OF LACRICIS
Line_732	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEIST TO GOOD OR OF GOOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
Line_733	THE STILL AND PLAN OF THE TIMES DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DILOKCTS
Line_734	HE PASSES ABBROUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONEMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES AR RATHER DOES NOT DESTINGWUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND HIS DREAMING OF JIOMEATRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUDS OF SENCE
Line_735	THE DIALOB IS PRIMARY CONSURNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
Line_736	BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRUTATION OF PLATOL AND IN SPIRITE THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
Line_737	HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE STILL BUT NOT IN ANOTHER IN THE GRIK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOFER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
Line_738	THE FANCIES OF THE NEEDLE PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXIBITD A FASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVALED WIDELY IN THE FIRST SENTORIES OF THE CRISTION ERA AND IS NOT HOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
Line_739	THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TIPS IN NATURE FORMS OF MEAN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
Line_740	IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOFER IS TO BE INTURPUTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
Line_741	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET TO FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEADISIN AND MATHOMATICXS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT TERE WAS AS GREAT AN INPIETY IN RINKING THEARIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOL
Line_742	IN THE SUPPOSED DEAPTHS OF THIS DIOLOG THE NEEDLE PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JUISH AND CRISTIONS SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELISITED DOCTRINS QUITE AT VERIEANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
Line_743	BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLY GIVEN UP
Line_744	THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMENTATORES ON THE TIMES FALLING INTO THE OBSERDITIES OF THE NE DO PLATONISTS
Line_745	THE INFLOENCE WHICH THE TIMES HAS EXURSISED UPON POSTERITY IS DOMBED PARTLY TO A MISS UNDERSTANDING
Line_746	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAG
Line_747	THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SICOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
Line_748	FAMILIARITY IS A FLING CAPABLE OF DEGREE
Line_749	A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
Line_750	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACUORISY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDOMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CARACTORISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILLY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
Line_751	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPALE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
Line_752	I CAN SET TO WORK KNOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BRECFOUST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
Line_753	THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTANCE IN VERTU OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFONITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
Line_754	IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ELUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING KNOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
Line_755	IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FELL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEFE IN THE ACURISY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UN FAMILIAR PARTS
Line_756	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARIVE AT
Line_757	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANNOLOGE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFONITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLIM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONSERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIASY
Line_758	SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENCATIONS FELL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FELL STRANGE
Line_759	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT ACCURANCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
Line_760	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_761	THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCE THOUG IN ANOTHER IT IS NOTT
Line_762	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CARACTORISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFARING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
Line_763	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
Line_764	ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALOCIS OF WHAT ACCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
Line_765	THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILLITY IN THE HIPOTHOCIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTS AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLY UN REAL PAST
Line_766	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUTLESS VERIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCURE IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOATNESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
Line_767	SYMNS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN ARLYER LECTURE DO NOT TUTCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
Line_768	THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONSURNED
Line_769	THE DEFONITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKXS OF WHICH THE VERIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
Line_770	THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
Line_771	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGEMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENCE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENCE OF THE WORD
Line_772	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLOUENCE OF FAT WE MAY SEE A FRIENDS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORIBLY DESTORTED
Line_773	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ACCURANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEFE THAT THESE IMAGES REFR TO PAST ACCURANCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTS KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
Line_774	A GRAMAFONE BY THE HELP OF SUTABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMAFONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
Line_775	IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FLINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FLINGS MUST PLAY AN CENTRAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
Line_776	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADIQUETE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVELE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMTIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELLIMMENTORY ACCURANCE AS RECOGNITION
Line_777	RECOGNITION IN THIS SENCE DOUS NOT NECESSARILY ENVALVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ESOSCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ESOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN ODITORY IMAGE OF PURING OR WHATEVER OTHER CARACTORISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
Line_778	WHAT IS CALLED PERSEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HEBITTUAL ESOSCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORLETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDESTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
Line_779	THIS DESTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTISE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
Line_780	IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
Line_781	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
Line_782	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADIQUECT TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
Line_783	I COME KNOW TO THE OTHER CARACTORISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_784	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECIGHTE A POIM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
Line_785	THE ANALOCIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
Line_786	THE FIRST OF OUR VAGE BUT INDUBITIBLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
Line_787	BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN IMPFORENCE IS WARENTED
Line_788	HABIT IS A CONSEPT INVALVING THE ACCURANCE OF SIMOLAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FILLS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A FHENOMENONE AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASURS HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
Line_789	WHENEVER THE SENCE OF FAMILIARITY CARS WITHOUT A DEFENATE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SERCH THE ENVIRMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFYGDE THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
Line_790	IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ATCHIVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ATCHIVED BY MEANS AND METHOUDS THAT COMEND THEMSELVES THRO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOICND EFFORT
Line_791	THE MAN OF THE HOUSE HOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOS BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDEGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMBS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY SEE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIERTUALY THE SOL EXPONENT OF THE HOUSE HOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY
Line_792	CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDERD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
Line_793	THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YELDED SO OBJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
Line_794	THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILLITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
Line_795	IN THE COMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
Line_796	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
Line_797	IT IS ALSO NOTICABLE THAT THE SRVICIBILITYVE CONSUMTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTANCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILLITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
Line_798	THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELIGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY HOME THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTIMARLY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NAROS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
Line_799	IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGHTENING THE UTILLITIVE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMTION AS COMPARED WITH LEASUR
Line_800	EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROTH
Line_801	THE MODERN ORGANISATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
Line_802	VERY MUCH OF SCOLOR AND DIS COMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY
Line_803	IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINSIHTE
Line_804	AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIAM OF NEGHBOHOD GOSIP SUFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PERPOS OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
Line_805	BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARLAS LEASURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVALLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
Line_806	THERE IS A MOROLESS ELABARATE SISTOME OF RAN AND GRATES
Line_807	THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINU TO BE THE SOL MOTIVES
Line_808	WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MEAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIMARY LEASURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES A REFLECTED ON ARIFPHIC CARACTOR
Line_809	THE WEARING OF YUNIFORMS OR LIVEARIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
Line_810	IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUGURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEASURE CLASS
Line_811	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEASURE CLASS ARE KNOBLE SUCH AS GOVERMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOTRIMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENCIVELY PREDITORY EMPLOYMENTS
Line_812	SUCH CONSUMTION AS FALLS THRO THE WIMAN IS MEARLY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT THE CONSUMTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
Line_813	DRUNKNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULENTE THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNORIPHIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
Line_814	THE YUTILLITY OF CONSUMTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASED AS A JERIVITY OF GROTH
Line_815	IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DESESED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SINENIM FOR KNOBLE OR GENTLE
Line_816	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRASY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS AT CETERA
Line_817	THE CONSEMPTION OF LUGURIES IN THE TRUE SENCE IS A CONSEMTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
Line_818	SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERISONE OF THE PATRIN MAY BE CLASED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
Line_819	WITH A FIRTHER ADVANCE AND CULTURE THIS TABUMAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CARACTER BUT WHAT EVER BE THE THIORETTICAL BACIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TAB OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALLITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCEM OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
Line_820	BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTIDATING THE IMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALSED CONSMPTION OF GODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUNE TO WORK OUT IN A MORE ORLESS SELBARATE SISTOM
Line_821	THE LIVEARY BECOMES OBNOTIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
Line_822	THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMAN'S TRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARIFORNAILIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RUL BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS ACEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANCIAL
Line_823	THE WEARORS OF YUNIFORMS AND LIVARIES MAY BE RELY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
Line_824	WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIORCAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT ON BINDING THAT WIMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
Line_825	BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOKED
Line_826	MANY OF THESE AFFILLIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEASURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESS A MAN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARSLY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTCIALLY TO BERATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMARS
Line_827	UNDER THE TAB CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERIGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
Line_828	THIS DIFRENSCIATION IS FIRTHERED BY THE INHERITENCE OF WELTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITENCE OF GENTILLITY
Line_829	THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVISES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALY MEND THE CONSUMERS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
Line_830	BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPROCATION OF WHAT IS CARACTORISED THUS WASTFUL
Line_831	UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVARTIXING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEASURE AND THE CONSPICUS CONSUMTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
Line_832	IN STRICT ACCURASY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
Line_833	THE SAILIANT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
Line_834	BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCAM LEASOR HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RAN VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSEMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WELTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARDS OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE PESIBAL COULTURE
Line_835	OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DESPOSES MEAN TO LOOK WITH FAVER UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
Line_836	AN ARTICLE MAY BE YOUSEFUL AND WASTFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF YOUSE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARING PROPORTIONS
Line_837	THE YOUSE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLY'S NO DEPROCATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUS WASTE
Line_838	A RECONSILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIRMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AN INTRICATE POLIGHTE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A SERIMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANISATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF MILIAORATION EMBODED IN THEIR OFFITCIAL STILL AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK ERS MAY NOT HAVE OCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALLOW OF THEIR TRAFFIC
Line_839	AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRICATION
Line_840	THE GOATS WAR LIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THEY SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
Line_841	THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROSE OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATERS TO SIT UPON
Line_842	AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDERS AND WITH BOWD HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BULAROW
Line_843	WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BULAROW LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUSLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
Line_844	THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTIN OF THE GARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUTFULLY AND THEY'VE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STILL OF WHISKERS AND THE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDED
Line_845	MORNING GIRLS HOPEVILL AS WELL AS YOU LOOK
Line_846	AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIVE THE BOULAROW GAVE A YELL OF DISSAPPOINTMENT
Line_847	THE CAPTON SHOOK HIS HEAD
Line_848	HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS IV HAD MY COPY AND OT WELL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIVE AND PATCH HIM
Line_849	I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BOWND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST SONG GOLD SHIVER TO RELIVE MY FEELINGS

Line_895	WHEN THE BLUE SKIN SAW GITKASCISLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVEARIT OF THE SOLDERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE

Line_900	HO L NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIED THE OLD BULAROW OUR REFORM
Line_901	DON'T WORRY SIZZLE DEAR IT ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
Line_902	HE DARTEDTHOGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
Line_903	HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ON WARD UNTIL HE KNEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
Line_904	HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURIED FORTH SADLY
Line_905	THE WORLD WAS WATER VALED IN MISTS
Line_906	THE HO AND DREAM OF HARVIST WAS UP ON THE LAND
Line_907	PERHAPS SHE TWO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEAPING
Line_908	HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ILAND A GREAT SHEET OF DASILING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF LIVE GREAN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
Line_909	ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOONE AND THE ILAND LOW THE COTAIN LAY BEFORE HER
Line_910	THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BRETH OF AIR STIRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEAL THE IRTH STEAMED
Line_911	THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGON WAS DRY
Line_912	THE REVOLLATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SONRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
Line_913	AH THE SWOMP THE CROL SWOMP
Line_914	HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDL WITH INFINATE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANNAWL FROM THE LEAN TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMOR HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
Line_915	HE GAYSED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
Line_916	THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
Line_917	HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPER MOST SORA
Line_918	FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID A APE WITH UTTER AMASEMENT THEN LEANED DISILLY AGAINST THE TREE
Line_919	SHE ROSE WHET HE FLING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHALL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWOMP
Line_920	WHERE WAS THE YOUSE OF IMAGINING
Line_921	THE LEAN HAD BEEN LEVELED WITH THE DIKS A WEEK AGO AND NOW
Line_922	SHE WAS SO STRANGE IND HUMAN A CREATURE
Line_923	HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEAS HIS ENDSORAS MUST BE RUINED
Line_924	THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
Line_925	THE SCQUAIRS OF COTAEN SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BIRST TO BOLES
Line_926	THE ED AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEACHLESS TEROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROE FOR HER LIFE WITH KNARLD AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER ES AND QUESTIONED

Line_928	FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE ITS SON AND BIRD AND TREE
Line_929	IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTEN ITSELF BUT THE FANTISY THE HOPS THE DRAMS BIT AROUND IT
Line_930	SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITH IN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MEAT HER LOVE
Line_931	UP IN THE SICK ROOM MSORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
Line_932	I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HAS CAPACITY THE ENGLISH MAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
Line_933	BUT WE NOT A EXACTLY WELCOME
Line_934	BUT CREST WELL ADDED SUGNIPICAENTELY COMPACITY DIFFERS INNORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
Line_935	MARRY TAILOW HOWEVER RELATED THE TAIL OF SORA TO MISSUS GRAYS PRIVAT EAR LATER
Line_936	THE VANDERPOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELLEQUENTE MISSUS GRAY WAS MISTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMITTET THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDGUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITED TO THE SHARPESCRUTAENY BEFORE BEING ALOWD MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH YOUSELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
Line_937	SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGROW EDUCATION
Line_938	DO WE BELIEVE IN SOME EJUCATION ASKED MARRY TAILER
Line_939	WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
Line_940	THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SERA'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER ESTERLY'S WALLSTRET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
Line_941	FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOLL NOR THE NOSAND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS

Line_944	AT LAST THE COTEN COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASRED FACT AND HE WAS SLAITED FOR THE SINET
Line_945	MISSUS GRAY HAD MEAT SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATDELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDELY THEIR CRULTY TO POOR NEGROS A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTH WITH
Line_946	SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A KNOTIBLY INTELLEIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELEIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELIGENCE IN OTHERS

Line_949	SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTEN THAT I WAS HERE WITHIN TUTCH AND SIGHT
Line_950	THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POATRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPARAT PROSE
Line_951	HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED OADEORS AND BODY PIRSPORATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBERIBLE
Line_952	THE GOLDEN FLICE ITS THE SILVER FLICE HE HARKENED

Line_963	AT ANY RATE I SAY GO
Line_964	GUBAES DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VANS BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE RODS LIKE YMBS IS THAT SO
Line_965	YOU AUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH KNEGROWS I'LL SCARSELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
Line_966	SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE KNEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALES AND TALKED OF GREAT FILLANTHORPIES AND REFORMS
Line_967	KNOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY KNOW NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTEN
Line_968	DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWOUDLY COMENTED MISS TAILER LITTEORY BORN COFTAIN AND O WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE YOUSE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
Line_969	FIND SOME CRESTWELS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
Line_970	IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE NOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENSE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A KNOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
Line_971	BEEN LOOKING UP TOMS COUNTY
Line_972	JOHN TAILOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTEIN
Line_973	CA TEN IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
Line_974	YOU KNOW CAPTIN LAKE
Line_975	I WAS THINKING ITS VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSERED THE CAPTIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
Line_976	OH I KNOW THAT'S LORNE BRANDON
Line_977	I HAD A HORRID DREME ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
Line_978	SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING ME
Line_979	AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
Line_980	AND WILDER LAUGHED TWO MORE SUDDENLY AND KNOISYLY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKES SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLENT CAPTIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARTHY ONLY REMARKING
Line_981	DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HELL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
Line_982	ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE YES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
Line_983	I'M GLAD YOULD LIKE IT SAIS WILDER CHUCKLING BENIGNENTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_984	I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JULS
Line_985	WHAT EVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
Line_986	HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKES SHOULDER
Line_987	BUT HER GREDING TO CAPTIN LIKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HOY AND FROSEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCYED PARTICULARLY PROD AND PALE
Line_988	HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
Line_989	AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELRAM WITH A GLEAME OF SLY AMUSEMENT
Line_990	WHERE UPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETELY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY YES
Line_991	THEY RE COSONS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COSONS
Line_992	THE MISTORY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVALVING LATENT FACOLTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HURSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHE MELIGNITIES IN EVERY KNEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASOSIATED THEM SOME HOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEDING AND DESTINCT FROM HUMAN AND SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
Line_993	IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
Line_994	THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RATIUL AT LAST SAID
Line_995	THE SOMBER OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HOURS PLOMS BLACK AND AWFUL
Line_996	MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIOUNALBLY COMFTORBLE BUT IN MY THEN MODE I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEL MORE MODERN
Line_997	THERE WAS A BRIGHT MONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOWS AND WITHERD LEAVES AND THE MODLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDE ODDLY ACROSS HIS PAIL FEATURES
Line_998	A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
Line_999	ALL THE FURNATURE BELONGD TO OTHER TIMES
Line_1000	IF A FELLOW HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BELLS ABOVE AT ONCE
Line_1001	SOME HOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
Line_1002	BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WIDER RETURNED AND DISCUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
Line_1003	MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARAGE TO NIGHT
Line_1004	MARK MY WORDS YOU FIND HIM TO STRONG FOR YOU I AM TO DEEP
Line_1005	WHAT I SAY IS ALL TOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Line_1006	BRACKTINS A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASURE YOU
Line_1007	DON'T INSULT ME STANDLY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
Line_1008	I DON'T KNOW ONE CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMAN TO FIND WICKDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMAIL I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LITS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
Line_1009	BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOULLISHLY
Line_1010	TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSABLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUDS
Line_1011	AND HE ADDED SOME THING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTORY
Line_1012	I AM VERY UN EASY ABOUT IT WHAT EVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
Line_1013	AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CAN TOWARDS BRANDIN HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
Line_1014	NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
Line_1015	I SHANT TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GOSTSTORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HUNTED CHAMBER
Line_1016	OF LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
Line_1017	I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUSION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNY
Line_1018	YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOOD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
Line_1019	ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FATED TAPSTRY
Line_1020	I BOLDLY LITED MY CHERRUT
Line_1021	WELL YOU KNOW RADY WIMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND IM SURE FROM WHAT BRAKTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORKIS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
Line_1022	THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT EDGE OF THE ROOM
Line_1023	IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AND ANTIPATHY I CAN NOT GET OVER DEAR DORKIS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
Line_1024	AND SHE THROW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRIAVED REACHUL AT LAST BIRSTD INTO TEARS
Line_1025	AND THE WAN ORICLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORKIS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSON'S YES
Line_1026	SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOK OF FEAR AND PASION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
Line_1027	YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RATIUL HURRIDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWOARLING IN HER FINGERS
Line_1028	POR RATCUL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECET AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
Line_1029	SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSLING OF FEMINN DRAPORIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RATCIUL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF BULCOME
Line_1030	IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMENDS FARM
Line_1031	WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
Line_1032	YES RATIUL I DO LOVE YOU
Line_1033	WIMEN CAN HID THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEAN AND BEAR IT BETTER TO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALIS
Line_1034	YOU RESEMBLE ME RATCIUL YOU ARE FEARLESS AND INFLEXIBLE AND GENEROUS
Line_1035	OF MARK WILDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISS ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT HIM
Line_1036	CHELFORD HAD A NOT FROM MISTER WILDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER NOT HIS COMING DELAYD AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO IS ABRAD CONTINUED DORKUS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
Line_1037	BUT POR RATCIUL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOWICAL HIPOCRESY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SE TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
Line_1038	THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONS AND MAR WHICH WAS KNEW TO RATUL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREDING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMAR SELF
Line_1039	DORKUS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
Line_1040	THANK YOU RATCIUL MY COSON RATIUL MY ONLY FRIEND
Line_1041	YES SAID RACHEL
Line_1042	YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POR RATCUL
Line_1043	THIS TRANSIETE SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOR BEGILING OUR SENSES

Line_1045	I LIKE YOU STILL RATCUL I AM SURE IS ALWAYS LIKE YOU
Line_1046	I HAVE VERY F TO LOVE ME KNOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
Line_1047	THINK YOU DORKS DEER
Line_1048	RATCIUL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED Y STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
Line_1049	THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTIONE OF THE EIFIS IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATIST WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUDERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
Line_1050	LITTLE PIRL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONT PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREST PLATE
Line_1051	THERE WERE A FEW ROSEBUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDENTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVERIEND MISTER BLACK STONE THE FIRST CETTLAR OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MITHOLODGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANELS SETTED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
Line_1052	AT THAT EPICK OF PRISTEN SIMPLISITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLITER PUBLIC INTREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WATE THAN THE WELLFAIRE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBORATIONS OF LEGISLATEORS AND ACTS OF STATE
Line_1053	LIFTING THE IRN HAMOR THAT HUNG AT THE PORTELE HESTER PRIN GAVE A SUMENS WHICH WAS ANSERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNORS BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
Line_1054	IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEMINGLY CABOLISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS STABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCO WHEN NEWLY LADE ONE AND HAD KNOW GROWN HARD AND DORIBLE FOR THE ADMORATION OF AFTER TIMES
Line_1055	ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEK AN INTERVIW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
Line_1056	WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMET AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANED HIS KNEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FARISTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
Line_1057	PURL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A READ ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
Line_1058	WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PIRLS RICH AND LUXORIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHOWN WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSESSING INTENCITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY A KIN TO BLACK
Line_1059	THE PERIAD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLYER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DESPUTE CONSURNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FEARS AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAME WORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
Line_1060	IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
Line_1061	SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TO WITH A TORIPHIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGETIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
Line_1062	THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED EKNOMNY WERE SO DEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY BROUGHT OUT THE SIMILLITUDE LAVISHING MANY OURS OF MORBID INJENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLIM OF HER GILTE AND TORTURE
Line_1063	PIRL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BO WINDOW AT THE FARTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMTORE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBERY
Line_1064	MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
Line_1065	HESTRPRIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSCION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMAR ROLLER TO DESCEND A STEP ORTO FROM THE HIGHEST RAN HE STILL HELD AND ONOURABLE AND IMFLOENCIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRASY
Line_1066	ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE CENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTER TANKERD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PERLE PEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FRO THY REMNENT OF A RECENT DRAFT OF AL
Line_1067	BUT PERL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTOURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE NO OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
Line_1068	YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
Line_1069	IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
Line_1070	YAY HIS ONOURABLE WORSHOP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTOR OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEACH
Line_1071	COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM
Line_1072	BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELENQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTAENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
Line_1073	BUT IN TRUTH PURL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
Line_1074	HESTER PRIN NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ARING ON THE SIDE OF UND SIVERITY
Line_1075	HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILDS CARACTOR AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIAD WHILE PERL WAS EMBIBING HER SOL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
Line_1076	IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MOLITIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PERL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
Line_1077	MIND FULL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISS FORTONS SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFINT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
Line_1078	BRUDING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONGORATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSABLE INTELIGENCE
Line_1079	THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
Line_1080	IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
Line_1081	HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELIGENCE THAT THROW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
Line_1082	THEY WERE NOW ELUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EIRTHLY EXISTANCE MIGHT BE PROLIPHIC OF THE STORM AND WORLWIND

Line_1084	BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PERS THE LITTLE EL IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOME WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVER FLOWING LOVE AS TO ASRE HERSELF THAT PIERL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
Line_1085	GOOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISONNURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOL IN HEAVEN
Line_1086	PURL SAW AND GASED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTENCE
Line_1087	AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISEPPLIN WHETHER ADDRESS TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PURL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDENCE WITH THE COAPPRISE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
Line_1088	THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULT LESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARBE THAT PRECISELY BECAME ITS BEST
Line_1089	YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRIN LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
Line_1090	THE GOOD NATURED OURDIENCE IN PITTY TO FALLEN MAGISTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUN THE SAME WHICH THE FORMAR HAD CALLED FOR
Line_1091	OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
Line_1092	HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJGUNCTURE WAS A PUBLICKE MISS FORTON
Line_1093	THE PARLIMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALES BEFORE THE KING
Line_1094	THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TRETY WITH THE KING
Line_1095	IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCUR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLIMATIONS AND WITH PRAIRS FOR HIS SAFTY
Line_1096	AND THE MEN OF ISRAIL ANSERED THE MEN OF JUDA AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YOU WHY THEN DID YOU DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
Line_1097	BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSESED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATABLE THAT SKAME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
Line_1098	THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SAME WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
Line_1099	THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMISTIONARS EFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTEARIOR RESPECT DW TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONEOR
Line_1100	ANOTHER PREATURE AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISS GOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS SUM TO BE SONG
Line_1101	THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SOME AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOME THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS

Line_1105	HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
Line_1106	VALLOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DEFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISSPPLIN ALSO WAS OPTAINED BY THE FORSES OF THE PARLIMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONSERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
Line_1107	BY QUICK MARCHERS T THROUGH THESE INEXCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORSES OF THE COVERNENTERS
Line_1108	HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORENCE AND IN EXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEAD LONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTL WERE VALLOUR AND FORTON CHIFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS

Line_1114	THIS NOBLEMAN'S CARACTER THOUS SELIBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWES AND AFTER SOME SCERMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WARSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROE TO ESCAPE HIM
Line_1115	THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURREGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTINNCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSD ROYALISTS
Line_1116	WHILE THE FORMOR FOR TOLD THAT THE SCOTISH COVEINENTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A YOUNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIMENT AND INCOLCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED

Line_1238	YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
Line_1239	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBEAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF ALCORAUNT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
Line_1240	BUT IN THIS VINET COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
Line_1241	HE KNOWS THEM BOTH
Line_1242	BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YO WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNAR DREW IT AT ALL
Line_1243	THE BROWN GROWN BENEATH IS LEFT FORTHE MOST PART ONE TUTCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TUTCH OF WHITE DRAW'S THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
Line_1244	THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUD TONS THEIR FAVERIT CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING ITHER DAN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
Line_1245	IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
Line_1246	MY FIRST IMPRINCIPALE REASON WAS THAT THEY INFORSED BEYOND ALL RESISTNCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COMPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HEW SIDE BY SIDE
Line_1247	SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMING FOR HIS INTANGLED IT
Line_1248	EXCQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETURNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCOLS OF CRISTOL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITTEORALLY BY TAKING ANY VIRSES OF CHER IN HIS TENDER MODE IN OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
Line_1249	BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEK IN IMAGINATION
Line_1250	EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWSE PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
Line_1251	ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FIRE
Line_1252	THOUS IN CHASER'S DREAME
Line_1253	THEY YOUNIGHT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YO WILL FIND ME REFRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS KORISCURISTS
Line_1254	NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HEARMONISED WITH THE OTHER HEWS IT BECOMES SOME HOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PERLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTRETED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIMANDS AN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JULS IF THEY ARE GRIDATED JUSTLY
Line_1255	IT WILL BE WHOLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILITY OF TEMPER AND PILISITY OF PATH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOATING THE FILISITY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
Line_1256	EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTOR TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEMINGLY NEGLEGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATOF CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUAL WORK OF HOLBINE OR DUR
Line_1257	THERE'S ONE AN THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
Line_1258	IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARIT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIAS ONE OF HIS SERIES F THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
Line_1259	WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNERS GRIEK SCOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DESPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STIRNEST INTILECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1260	BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURASCURIST DEVOATS HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORE AND ONE THING UN SEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTANMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
Line_1261	NOW HERE IS RUHIOW EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
Line_1262	IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHAT SO EVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESNESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND PRE
Line_1263	YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
Line_1264	HERE IS AN EQUALLY TIPICAL GREK SCOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST HOLLY IND GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHAT SO EVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVALESS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROGH THE MIST APPOLOW IN THE PITHINE
Line_1265	YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOR MEN TITION HOLBINE TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
Line_1266	THIS AT ONCE COMPELLES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEARIST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JULOERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
Line_1267	DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCOL IS AN EASY ONE
Line_1268	IN ALL ERTHLY GOTHICK ART INDEED YOU I FIND FALLIOR OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DESTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDED REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
Line_1269	THAT A STILL IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERONIOUS
Line_1270	FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCKRABN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLAT TO BE GREAN AND THE BEST SKI OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEASING ON THE MANIFUL DELITIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEASED BY PRECISION OF INSTENTANIOUS TUCH
Line_1271	IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLLORTLISTS WILL YOSE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTU IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
Line_1272	IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINED BY ED WORD BURN GJONS IN ILLISTRATION OF THE STORY OF SIKY IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF SIKY AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
Line_1273	YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONCOR HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
Line_1274	SOME OF THE TUTCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRISTOLISE HARD AT THE EDGE
Line_1275	IN BOTH THESE HEY MITHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOSE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
Line_1276	THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEBLE AND I DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIORE HAND IT IS NOT CARACTORISTIC OF GOTHICK OR ANY OTHER SCOL
Line_1277	IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITS FLY FALCKINS WHO INSTEAD OF OBAYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPARD TO FED HIS SHEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GARIEAGL
Line_1278	NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AN GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
Line_1279	THE LAW OF THAT SCOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINT NESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELLIMENTORY PRACTIS OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
Line_1280	THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELITIOUS PEROCADE WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMEY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLODED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
Line_1281	THE SEEN IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
Line_1282	THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
Line_1283	IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEFE OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITS SELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARSLY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
Line_1284	BUT CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
Line_1285	IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PALE AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIDE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROAKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
Line_1286	I'M SURE ALEXCANDRA HOPES YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED

Line_1314	SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THROW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
Line_1315	BUT AMIL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE

Line_1843	I DELITE IN YOUR CITCSHION

Line_1850	NO SOUR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RUCETER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WALL
Line_1851	I COULD NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SO'S OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THOUGH VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
Line_1852	HENCE THE ATTICSONE ELECTROLITIC METER IS NO LONGER YUSED DESPIGHTE ITS EXCOLENT QUALITIES
Line_1853	THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIVING THAT I WILL CHANGE
Line_1854	THE PRINCIPALE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLITIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFYES THE POWER OF ELECTRISITY TO DECOMPOSE A KEMICAL SUBSTANCE
Line_1855	THE LUNDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMINENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FUR THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELLS CHERCHES STORS AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCK
Line_1856	EVERY THING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
Line_1857	BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSCEIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENTSE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
Line_1858	EDISON HAD ENSTOLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GRATE CENTRAL STATION SISTOM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIBLE ARK SISTOM COVERED BY HIS FER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A KNOTBLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST THE STRAT TWIRES SISTOM THROUGH OUT OF THE TREE KIND
Line_1859	THERE MESSIRS JONSON AND HAMOR PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS KNOW STANDERED IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH YOUSEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
Line_1860	BROAD AS THE PRERIS AND FREAN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEP THEM HE IS ITIOSINCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POR AT THE ATE
Line_1861	HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JAB WOULD ST HIM BETTER
Line_1862	I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRICIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISEPPLIN OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
Line_1863	ASOSIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APORATIS WERE VERIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACURISY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT VE CURRENT OR DAMAGE
Line_1864	THE DINAMO ELECTRIC MASHEN THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUSED FOR UNDER ALL THE VERYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VESCISITUDS OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGD IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINTY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
Line_1865	IT COULD NOT BE YUSED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
Line_1866	THE STANDERD EDISON METER PRACTISE WAS TO REMOVE THE SELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
Line_1867	THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SISTOM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPATITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRESISTOM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPTIS TO INCONDEANT LIGHTING
Line_1868	THE ARCK LAMP INSTOAD OUTSIDE A CUSTOMORS PREMISSES OR IN A SIRCKET FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTELY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
Line_1869	FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENTS SIRKETS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN ERGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
Line_1870	HE SOON FOR SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONEMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE SITS
Line_1871	EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
Line_1872	THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBEROCADE AN ENGION FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDESON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MORIAN ENGIN STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGIN FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
Line_1873	THEY WERE LATER YUSED AS RESERVED MASHENS AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGION RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ETTISCONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY IS GOOD CONDITION AS EN ENSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
Line_1874	MEAN WHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRES SISTOM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPCKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPCKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN VENEROUS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
Line_1875	IT WAS SPECIALY SUTED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YELD OF SIX OR IT LAMPS TO THE HORSEBOWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRADULATION
Line_1876	THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD HOLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTOLLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EATISON TO BILD AND EQUIPE CENTRAL STATIONS
Line_1877	WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
Line_1878	HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
Line_1879	THE PROBLEM WAS SAVED
Line_1880	WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
Line_1881	THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
Line_1882	OWING TO HIS INSISTANCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR YOUSE IN DENSLY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRUELY UNIVERSAL PROPHITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN APPONAENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
Line_1883	IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUBLUW G GENKXS READ AN INTRESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEARS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THAND MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
Line_1884	THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINATE RESULTS ALL THOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDE BASIS
Line_1885	IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ESOSIATION OF EDISON ALUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT IT'S USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVERYABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
Line_1886	MISTER ATTISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
Line_1887	EDISON WAS INTOLORENT OF SHAM AND SHODEY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICRESCOPE TASTBE AND GALBENOMTER
Line_1888	THERE WAS INFINATE SCEPTISISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTERS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANY THING SO UTTERLY INTANGABLE AS ELECTRISITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WAYD AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
Line_1889	BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
Line_1890	HE WAYD AND REWAYED THE METER PLATES AND PERSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAN
Line_1891	UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGIN OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DINMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
Line_1892	WHY IF WE ERECT HE STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOAMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
Line_1893	THE PARRIS PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE CRISTAL PALLIS WAS A TEMPORARY EXIBIT
Line_1894	THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASS IN MEDFORE RAGS

Line_2176	I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOMED TO MY HOME
Line_2177	HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINCLED WHEN HE MOVED
Line_2178	WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONLIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELYIER PLACE
Line_2179	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAJITION WHOME HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
Line_2180	NO ONE WOULD DESTERB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FORIST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
Line_2181	THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
Line_2182	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLD A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
Line_2183	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AS IN WHICH THEY LIVED
Line_2184	AND YOU MUST BE O JOH THE UN LUCKY SHE ADDED
Line_2185	AT THE EMOALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCES ASMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
Line_2186	AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIRPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLASING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOR CELS IN A ROW ALL BUBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
Line_2187	HUNK KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALLIMP BLOW OPENED IT AND GRETED THE VISITERS WITH A SMILE
Line_2188	I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUBERD AND THROW OPEN THE DOORS
Line_2189	YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
Line_2190	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NONE UNK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND AT THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNSCKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
Line_2191	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROD NOR HOTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOUAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
Line_2192	BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSE WORK AND TO COKE THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
Line_2193	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POUDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOD WIFE MARGALOT WHO WANTS TO YOUS SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
Line_2194	HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE NEEPANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFLED WASTE AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRATED WITH GOLD
Line_2195	INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WAR BOATS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUTS OF GOLD BRAD
Line_2196	IM AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF EARS
Line_2197	THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE O JO THE UN LUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TON
Line_2198	I THINK THE NEXT CLASS CAT THE MAJITION MAKES WILL HAVE NITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
Line_2199	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
Line_2200	YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNK NUNKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
Line_2201	THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CHAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
Line_2202	YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALOUT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SET THAT MY HUSBAND FULLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POUDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMBY THE WHICH WHO YOUSED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLCINS TO THE NORTH ON HERE
Line_2203	WHEN THEY WERE OUT SIDE HUNK SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
Line_2204	WERE TRAVELING REPLID OJO AND WE STOP THAT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
Line_2205	WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALOUGHT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FELL ABOVE HER WORK
Line_2206	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POUDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLS
Line_2207	OJO BECAME A BIT UN EASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POUDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFER AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CAN NOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
Line_2208	GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEAL IN THE LAND OF AS AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
Line_2209	THE WISERD OF US WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND NEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WISERD BUT HE IS NEARLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORSORISE
Line_2210	MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEFE TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
Line_2211	DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOCXS YOURE GETTING TO BE HUNK REMARKED THE MAJITION WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
Line_2212	SHE RAN TO HER HUSBOND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOR CELS FROM THE FIRE
Line_2213	IT TRULY IS ASCERTED THE MAJITION
Line_2214	THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRADS
Line_2215	I KNOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
Line_2216	GO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVENCE WITH WONDER
Line_2217	SHE PORED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
Line_2218	MARGOLUD HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORKE SCIRT AND AN APRN WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
Line_2219	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGITION REMOVED THIS POUDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
Line_2220	I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGICK EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITERS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEMB AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
Line_2221	NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
Line_2222	ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
Line_2223	THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
Line_2224	I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEADED IN A SERVANT
Line_2225	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POUTER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE COUBEARD
Line_2226	THEIR CONTENCS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POUDER
Line_2227	LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMENTARY ONGOLATIONS
Line_2228	WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LOTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
Line_2229	IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LOTHOR ADRESSD TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GOLATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANOUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
Line_2230	A WORD SHOULD KNOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHOR'S COMENTORY ANGOULATIONS
Line_2231	IT WAS RITEN IN LATIN
Line_2232	THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
Line_2233	BUT THE ESSENCE OF LOTHOR'S LECTURS IS THERE
Line_2234	THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENCED
Line_2235	THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITED TO MAKE LOTHOR TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE O WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LOTHORIN CHERCH ACTUALLY TO READ LOTHOR UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
Line_2236	THE WORD OF OUR GOOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
Line_2237	MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTERIN MY GOLATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
Line_2238	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOK TO
Line_2239	IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHOR'S RIGHTINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINER FOR THE SAKE OF CRISTS MERITS ALONE
Line_2240	BY HIS RESERECTION CRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVLE DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVEL
Line_2241	THAT CRIST IS VERY GOOD IS A PARENT IN THAT PALL ESCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DESPENDE GRACE AND PEACE
Line_2242	OTHERWISE PALE SHOULD HAVE RITEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CRICST
Line_2243	PALL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINESTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOOD
Line_2244	PALL ANSERS THE MAN WHO HAS NAMED JESUS CRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2245	ALL THOUGH THE BRETHERIN WITH ME ARE NOT APPOSSAL'S LIKE MYSELF YET THEY RE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
Line_2246	WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
Line_2247	NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PATIA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
Line_2248	THIS SHU GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS TO THE FALSE OPPOSALS
Line_2249	INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHERCH OF CRIST FOR A LONG TIME
Line_2250	NOT ALL THE GOLATIONS HAD BECOME PRVERTED
Line_2251	THE GREATING OF THE APPOSCAL IS REFRESHING
Line_2252	NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
Line_2253	AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APPOSLE'S PALE BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APPISTOLIC ATHORITY AND MINISTRY
Line_2254	THE VICIOUS CARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
Line_2255	AT THE SAME TIME POLE CONFIRMES OUR CREED THAT CRIST IS VERY GOOD
Line_2256	THEY REMAIND DEVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
Line_2257	THESE PREVERTERS OF THE RICIOUSNESS OF CRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
Line_2258	AS THE AMBASCITER OF A GOVERMENT IS ONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CRIST SHOULD EXSULT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN ATHORTY AMONG MEN
Line_2259	AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RACED HIM FROM THE DEAD
Line_2260	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGLES CAN NOT
Line_2261	I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINUSTRY
Line_2262	HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS OPPISTAL
Line_2263	DID NOT CRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMEATH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
Line_2264	WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
Line_2265	PALE CAME LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
Line_2266	BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
Line_2267	THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLY PRIDE
Line_2268	THEY SAID TO THE GOLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HILY OF PA
Line_2269	WE ARE TO HEAR CRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
Line_2270	THE EARIANS TOOK CRICTE FOR A KNOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGIELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
Line_2271	HOW MAY WE OBTAINE REMITION OF OUR SINS
Line_2272	ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DISPARE
Line_2273	DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LTHERIN HERITICS WOLD DIS ONE HIS ENTIRE CHERCH
Line_2274	MEAN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOOD
Line_2275	THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE RE COMMON TERMS WITH PA AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
Line_2276	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PA WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
Line_2277	THE GREAT NESS OF THE RANDSOME CRISTE THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
Line_2278	AND ALL THE BRETHERON WHICH ARE WITH ME
Line_2279	SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APPISTAL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREATING OF THE APPOSSTAL VIRSE THREE
Line_2280	WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE WHOLLY CHERCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICRIST RAINS THERE
Line_2281	POLE STICKS TO HIS THEM
Line_2282	EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOOD
Line_2283	BUT THE REAL SGNIFICENCE AND COMFORT F THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
Line_2284	IN THIS WHOLE APPISTLE POLL TREATS OF THE RESEORECTION OF CRIST
Line_2285	PA AND APPOSSLE NOT OF MEN AT CETERA
Line_2286	THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPALE PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CRISTIOANS ARE
Line_2287	I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRIN OF FATH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOFISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOSTING
Line_2288	IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDER MINE THE ATHORITY OF SAINT PA
Line_2289	GRATE INVALVES THE REMITION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
Line_2290	THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEAN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
Line_2291	TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOWLORABLE WHEN WE SEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS IMFINATE MAGISTY
Line_2292	WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
Line_2293	THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
Line_2294	HE MENTIONED THE APPOSCAL'S FIRST BECAUSETHEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
Line_2295	WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTORIN TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOUPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOOD
Line_2296	UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SOR CONSCIENCES
Line_2297	HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFERED WAS CROUSIFIED AND THEN HE DID STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND YES MAY FASTON UPON HIM
Line_2298	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAME IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
Line_2299	THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENS FOR A SINGLE SIN
Line_2300	EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
Line_2301	MAHOMAD ALSO SPAKS HIGHLY OF CRIST
Line_2302	FOR A PERSON TO POSES KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
Line_2303	SINCE CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFORTS
Line_2304	THIS ATITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FOULSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIONCS THAT WE MUST FEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
Line_2305	EITHER HE CALLS MINISTORS THROUGH THE AGIENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APPOSALES
Line_2306	THE WORLD BRANS THIS A PRENITIOUS DOCTERIN
Line_2307	IT SPOILES ONE'S BEST WORK
Line_2308	HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIECE OF GOD WILL
Line_2309	FIRST TO
Line_2310	BUT CALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIHTELY
Line_2311	THE CLASS SEEMED SUPERFOLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
Line_2312	GRACE BET YOU IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CRIST
Line_2313	PA DECLARES THAT THE FALSE POLES WERE CALLED HER SENT NEITHER BY MAN NOR BY MAN
Line_2314	HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CRIST
Line_2315	WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR ER HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
Line_2316	THESE MEANS CAN NOT BE CONTAMIUNATED
Line_2317	PARTLY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
Line_2318	HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY KNEW PLAY
Line_2319	I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COKARY
Line_2320	ALEXANDR WENT OVER AND OPEND THE WINDOW FOR HER
Line_2321	ITS RARELY TO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
Line_2322	THERE ARE FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD QORTER
Line_2323	THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
Line_2324	THERE WAS WATER CREST SOOP AND SOL AND A DELIGHTFUL OMLET STUFFED WITH MUSHROMS AND TROUFLES AND TWO SMALL REAR DUCKLINGS AND ART CHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
Line_2325	DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PAIS

Line_2331	I THINK WE DID SHE ANSERED DIMEURLY
Line_2332	FOR A LONG TIME EITHER HILLDA NOR BARTLY SPOKE
Line_2333	HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA
Line_2334	WHEN PARTLY ARRIVED AT BEDFORDS SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARRI THE PRETTY LTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STAIRS
Line_2335	COME WELL HAVE OUR COPY IN TE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE
Line_2336	HE STOOD ALITE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID ITS SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
Line_2337	ALEXANDER CLENCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
Line_2338	ITS NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHERS
Line_2339	BARTLY LAND OVER HER SHOULDER WITH OUT TUTCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES

Line_2346	THERE'S NOTHING ELCE THAT LOOKS SO JOLLY
Line_2347	IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LASILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COPY
Line_2348	HE FELT A TREMAR RUN THOGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
Line_2349	THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
Line_2350	NONSENCE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRAND MOTHER DID BEFORE ME
Line_2351	WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOTH
Line_2352	HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVASLY OVER HIS HIGH COLOR
Line_2353	I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POR COUSON MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
Line_2354	I UNDERSTAND BARTLY I WAS RONG
Line_2355	I GET NOTHING BUT MISORY OUT OF EITHER
Line_2356	PARTLY BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE
Line_2357	SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIR AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HARTH HER KNEES DROWN UP TO HER CHIN LALHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
Line_2358	DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
Line_2359	HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
Line_2360	SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
Line_2361	WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
Line_2362	THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
Line_2363	THE STOP AT QUENS TOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSY WERE THINGS THAT HE KNOTED DIMLY THROUH HIS GROWING IMPATIANCE
Line_2364	IT WAS MY SELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
Line_2365	HILDAE'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
Line_2366	HE TOOK ER ROLY IN HIS ARMS DO OU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

Line_2371	BUT ITS WORSE NOW ITS UNBARIBLE
Line_2372	ALEXANDR PASSED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTENING AND UNBUTTENING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
Line_2373	BE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
Line_2374	HE MOVED UN EASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED
Line_2375	I THOUHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSON MIKE WOLD BE HAPPENING ALONG
Line_2376	WHEN DID YOU COME PARTLY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD

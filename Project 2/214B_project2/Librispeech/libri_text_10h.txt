AND TWAS ONLY SHOOTING AT A VENTURE WE WERE SAFE BUT FOR HOW SHORT A TIME SAFE JUST FOR SO LONG AS IT SHOULD PLEASE THE SOLDIERS NOT TO COME DOWN TO TAKE US
EVER SO LITTLE IT CAUSED ME SHARP PAIN FOR FEELING WAS COMING BACK AFTER THE FIRST NUMBNESS OF THE SHOT THEY HAVE BROKE THE LEG THOUGH IT BLEEDS LITTLE ELZEVIR SAID WE HAVE NO TIME TO SPLICE IT HERE
SAFE WITH A DISCHARGED PISTOL IN OUR GRASP AND A SHOT MAN LYING AT OUR FEET ELZEVIR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK CAN YOU STAND JOHN IS THE BONE BROKEN
WE HAVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE POSSE CAN GET DOWN TO US BUT COME THEY WILL AND THOU CANST JUDGE WHAT CHANCE WE HAVE TO SAVE LIBERTY
SHAKESPEARE THE WHILE CHALK WAS A BULWARK BETWEEN US AND THE FOE AND THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM LOOSED OFF THEIR MATCHLOCKS TRYING TO GET AT US SIDEWAYS THEY COULD NOT EVEN SEE THEIR QUARRY
HOW FEARFUL AND DIZZY TIS TO CAST ONE'S EYES SO LOW I'LL LOOK NO MORE
SO ONLY GAVE A SIGH WISHING HEARTILY THAT MASKEW WERE NOT DEAD AND THAT MY LEG WERE NOT BROKE BUT THAT I WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE WHY NOT OR EVEN HEARING ONE OF DOCTOR SHERLOCK'S SERMONS IN MY AUNT'S PARLOUR
AND THEY WILL TAKE THEE ALIVE AND THEN THERE IS A DANCE ON AIR AT DORCHESTER JAIL I FELT SICK WITH PAIN AND BITTERLY CAST DOWN TO THINK THAT I WAS LIKE TO COME SO SOON TO SUCH A VILE END
I CANNOT STAND I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING GONE IN MY LEG AND I FEEL BLOOD RUNNING DOWN INTO MY BOOT HE KNELT AND ROLLED DOWN THE LEG OF MY STOCKING BUT THOUGH HE ONLY MOVED MY FOOT
AND THEREFORE DO NOT BLAME THEE IF THOU DIDST MAKE ME WASTE A CHARGE IN AIR SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS TO WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY COME AND I CAN ACCOUNT FOR A FEW OF THEM BEFORE THEY SHOOT ME DOWN BUT THOU CANST NOT FIGHT WITH A BROKEN LEG
BUT I WILL PUT A KERCHIEF ROUND AND WHILE I WRAP IT LISTEN TO HOW WE LIE AND THEN CHOOSE WHAT WE SHALL DO I NODDED BITING MY LIPS HARD TO CONCEAL THE PAIN HE GAVE ME AND HE WENT ON
AND HE JERKED HIS THUMB AT MASKEW
IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
WAS ONCE OUR HOUSE THIS SIR IS THE BUILDING FROM WHICH I HAVE SO OFTEN SEEN THOSE GREAT CREATURES MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE AUNT JANE AND UNCLE PARKER' WHOSE VERY NAMES WERE OF HIS OWN INVENTING
AS THAT THE ROMAN EMPIRE USUALLY DECLINED IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EMINENTLY ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY MANSION RATHER THAN IN THE EVENING AS OF YORE AND IN BOFFIN'S BOWER THERE WERE OCCASIONS HOWEVER WHEN MISTER BOFFIN SEEKING A BRIEF REFUGE FROM THE BLANDISHMENTS OF FASHION
CHAPTER SEVEN IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MISTER BOFFIN AND HIS LITERARY MAN MISTER SILAS WEGG SO FAR ALTERED WITH THE ALTERED HABITS OF MISTER BOFFIN'S LIFE
AND HAS IT COME TO THIS INDEED AH DEAR ME DEAR ME SO TENDER WERE HIS LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KINDLY MISTER BOFFIN WAS QUITE SORRY FOR HIM AND ALMOST FELT MISTRUSTFUL THAT IN BUYING THE HOUSE HE HAD DONE HIM AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
IF WEGG HAD BEEN WORSE PAID FOR HIS OFFICE OR BETTER QUALIFIED TO DISCHARGE IT
BUT HOLDING THE POSITION OF A HANDSOMELY REMUNERATED HUMBUG HE RESENTED THEM THIS WAS QUITE ACCORDING TO RULE FOR THE INCOMPETENT SERVANT BY WHOMSOEVER EMPLOYED IS ALWAYS AGAINST HIS EMPLOYER EVEN THOSE BORN GOVERNORS NOBLE AND RIGHT HONOURABLE CREATURES
WHO HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMBECILE IN HIGH PLACES HAVE UNIFORMLY SHOWN THEMSELVES THE MOST OPPOSED SOMETIMES IN BELYING DISTRUST SOMETIMES IN VAPID INSOLENCE TO THEIR EMPLOYER WHAT IS IN SUCH WISE TRUE OF THE PUBLIC MASTER AND SERVANT IS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE PRIVATE MASTER AND SERVANT ALL THE WORLD OVER
THAT FAR SEEING AND FAR REACHING CHARACTER BY WAY OF ASSERTING HIMSELF AND MAKING OUT A CASE FOR COMPENSATION AFFECTED TO FALL INTO A MELANCHOLY STRAIN OF MUSING OVER THE MOURNFUL PAST AS IF THE HOUSE AND HE HAD HAD A FALL IN LIFE TOGETHER
TWO OR THREE DIPLOMATIC INTERVIEWS THE RESULT OF GREAT SUBTLETY ON MISTER WEGG'S PART BUT ASSUMING THE MASK OF CARELESS YIELDING TO A FORTUITOUS COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IMPELLING HIM TOWARDS CLERKENWELL HAD ENABLED HIM TO COMPLETE HIS BARGAIN WITH MISTER VENUS
WHEN MISTER SILAS WEGG DID AT LAST OBTAIN FREE ACCESS TO OUR HOUSE AS HE HAD BEEN WONT TO CALL THE MANSION OUTSIDE WHICH HE HAD SAT SHELTERLESS SO LONG AND WHEN HE DID AT LAST FIND IT IN ALL PARTICULARS AS DIFFERENT FROM HIS MENTAL PLANS OF IT AS ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THINGS IT WELL COULD BE
BRING ME ROUND TO THE BOWER SAID SILAS WHEN THE BARGAIN WAS CLOSED NEXT SATURDAY EVENING AND IF A SOCIABLE GLASS OF OLD JAMAIKEY WARM SHOULD MEET YOUR VIEWS I AM NOT THE MAN TO BEGRUDGE IT YOU ARE AWARE OF MY BEING POOR COMPANY SIR REPLIED MISTER VENUS BUT BE IT SO
WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE BOWER AFTER DARK TO ANTICIPATE THE NEXT SALLYING FORTH OF WEGG
HIS THOUGHTFUL AIR AND THE ANXIOUS GLANCES HE CAST EVERY NOW AND THEN TOWARD ONE OF THE LITTLE GRATED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDING SUFFICED TO INDICATE THAT SOME VERY RARE BIRD INDEED HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO HIS KEEPING
WE WILL THROW THEM IN AND HURRY THE DRIVER OFF LECOQ WAS OBLIGED TO INTERRUPT THE KEEPER'S TRANSPORTS OF SATISFACTION ARE THE PRISONERS ALONE HE INQUIRED QUITE ALONE
THIS HAS BEEN A REMARKABLY QUIET NIGHT FOR SHROVE SUNDAY QUITE SURPRISING INDEED IT IS TRUE YOUR HUNT WAS INTERRUPTED YOU HAD A DRUNKEN MAN HERE HOWEVER NO YES THAT'S TRUE
WHEN HE WAS PLACED IN A CELL BANG HE FELL DOWN LIKE A LOG OF WOOD
AND ON COMING OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR THE WINE FLEW INTO HIS HEAD HE TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT WHEN HE GOT SOBER HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARD I NEVER SAW A MAN SO VEXED AS HE WAS HE WEPT AND STAMMERED THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AND AT MY AGE TOO
HE BEGGED US TO SEND FOR THE COMMISSARY TO GO TO HIS HOUSE AND WHEN WE SET HIM FREE I THOUGHT HE WOULD GO MAD WITH JOY HE KISSED OUR HANDS AND THANKED US AGAIN AND AGAIN AND DID YOU PLACE HIM IN THE SAME CAGE AS THE MURDERER INQUIRED LECOQ
THE YOUNG POLICE AGENT HAD GROWN VERY THOUGHTFUL I WAS EVIDENTLY RIGHT HE MURMURED WHAT DID YOU SAY
AND HE PAUSED IN HIS PROMENADE AH WELL HE INQUIRED WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING I HAVE AN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE PRISONERS TO THE PREFECTURE
WAS NOT INCLINED TO COMMUNICATE HIS REFLECTIONS TO THE CUSTODIAN OF THE GUARD HOUSE THESE REFLECTIONS OF HIS WERE BY NO MEANS PLEASANT ONES I WAS RIGHT HE THOUGHT THIS PRETENDED DRUNKARD WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE ACCOMPLICE HE IS EVIDENTLY AN ADROIT
OH IT IS SHAMEFUL WHAT SHALL I SAY TO MY WIFE WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN THINK DID HE TALK MUCH ABOUT HIS WIFE HE TALKED ABOUT NOTHING ELSE HE MENTIONED HER NAME EUDOSIA LEOCADIE OR SOME NAME OF THAT SORT
CAPITAL CAPITAL HE EXCLAIMED
AUDACIOUS COOL HEADED FELLOW WHILE WE WERE TRACKING HIS FOOTPRINTS HE WAS WATCHING US WHEN WE HAD GOT TO SOME DISTANCE HE WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO ENTER THE HOVEL
OF COURSE THEN THEY TALKED WITH EACH OTHER TALKED
YOU MAY LAUGH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE RETORTED THE KEEPER BUT SUCH IS REALLY THE CASE IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR GEVROL THE MAN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN RUN OVER AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM THE KEEPER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS YOU ASK ME TOO MUCH HE RESPONDED
INTO NEW CHANNELS AND CHANGE THE FACE OF WHOLE CONTINENTS MAHOMET THAT STRANGEST OF MORAL ENIGMAS PROPHET AND SEER FANATIC AND IMPOSTOR WAS DEVELOPING HIS CAREER ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE PERSIAN WAR
THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
EVENTS OF WORLD WIDE IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HISTORY THERE HAD ARISEN AMONG THE ARABS ONE OF THOSE WORLD COMPELLING MINDS THAT ARE DESTINED TO TURN ASIDE THE CURRENT OF EVENTS
AND DELIVERED AN ATTACK SO VEHEMENT THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO DESTROY THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF PERSIA AND TO SHEAR AWAY HALF THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
THE ROMAN AND THE PERSIAN EMPIRES DRAINED OF MEN AND MONEY AND RAVAGED FROM END TO END BY EACH OTHER'S MARAUDING ARMIES SANK DOWN IN EXHAUSTION TO HEAL THEM OF THEIR DEADLY WOUNDS
BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE
NEVER BEFORE HAD EITHER POWER DEALT ITS NEIGHBOUR SUCH FEARFUL BLOWS AS IN THIS LAST STRUGGLE IN PREVIOUS WARS THE CONTEST HAD BEEN WAGED AROUND BORDER FORTRESSES AND THE PRIZE HAD BEEN THE CONQUEST OF SOME SMALL SLICE OF MARCHLAND
INTO THE LAND BEYOND THE SYRIAN DESERT BUT NEITHER OF THEM DREAMED THAT THE SCATTERED AND DISUNITED TRIBES OF ARABIA WOULD EVER COMBINE OR BECOME A SERIOUS DANGER
THE POLITICS OF ARABIA HAD UP TO THIS TIME BEEN OF LITTLE MOMENT EITHER TO ROMAN OR PERSIAN EACH OF THEM HAD ALLIES AMONG THE ARAB TRIBES AND HAD SOMETIMES SENT AN EXPEDITION OR AN EMBASSY SOUTHWARD
THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
HAD I NOT BEEN HELD UP WILLY NILLY BY THE SPELL WHICH WAS UPON ME I SHOULD HAVE SUNK DOWN THEN AND THERE IN A HOPELESS HELPLESS HAPLESS HEAP BUT MY TORMENTOR WAS NOT YET AT AN END WITH ME
OVER THE LOW WALL I WENT OVER THE SILL ONCE MORE I STOOD IN THAT CHAMBER OF MY HUMILIATION AND MY SHAME AND ONCE AGAIN I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THAT AWFUL SENSE OF THE PRESENCE OF AN EVIL THING
BRUISED AND CUT AND BLEEDING AS PITEOUS AN OBJECT AS YOU WOULD CARE TO SEE EVERY LIMB IN MY BODY ACHED EVERY MUSCLE WAS EXHAUSTED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY I WAS DONE
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS FACT AND HOW MUCH OF IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF IMAGINATION I CANNOT SAY BUT LOOKING BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS AS IF I HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CORPOREAL BODY
AND IT IS AS THOUGH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE VERY VALLEY OF THE SHADOW THE THING WENT BACK I COULD HEAR IT SLIPPING AND SLIDING ACROSS THE FLOOR THERE WAS SILENCE AND PRESENTLY THE LAMP WAS LIT
THERE WAS THE SOUND OF SOMETHING FLOPPING FROM OFF THE BED ON TO THE GROUND AND I KNEW THAT THE THING WAS COMING AT ME ACROSS THE FLOOR MY STOMACH QUAKED MY HEART MELTED WITHIN ME
CHAPTER NINE THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET I PULLED UP SHARPLY AS IF A BRAKE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY AND EVEN MERCILESSLY APPLIED TO BRING ME TO A STANDSTILL
THE VERY ANGUISH OF MY TERROR GAVE ME STRENGTH TO SCREAM AND SCREAM SOMETIMES EVEN NOW I SEEM TO HEAR THOSE SCREAMS OF MINE RINGING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND I BURY MY FACE IN THE PILLOW
IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW I STOOD SHIVERING A SHOWER HAD RECENTLY COMMENCED THE FALLING RAIN WAS BEING BLOWN BEFORE THE BREEZE I WAS IN A TERRIBLE SWEAT YET TREMULOUS AS WITH COLD COVERED WITH MUD
AS I STOOD THERE LIKE SOME BROKEN AND BEATEN HACK WAITING FOR THE WORD OF COMMAND IT CAME IT WAS AS IF SOME STRONG MAGNETIC CURRENT HAD BEEN SWITCHED ON TO ME THROUGH THE WINDOW TO DRAW ME INTO THE ROOM
AND THE ROOM WAS ALL IN BRIGHTNESS THERE ON THE BED IN THE FAMILIAR ATTITUDE BETWEEN THE SHEETS HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS HAND HIS EYES BLAZING LIKE LIVING COALS WAS THE DREADFUL CAUSE OF ALL MY AGONIES
SHE MERELY THOUGHT THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS ON THE LOWER FLOORS HAD STEPPED UP TO BORROW SOMETHING COME IN SHE CRIED AS SHE ADJUSTED THE SHADE OF THE LAMP A TALL THIN PALE WOMAN ENTERED
WITH WHICH SHE ENCOUNTERED THIS GAZE IT WAS SO INTENT SO SEARCHING YET SO UTTERLY DEVOID OF A TRACE OF GOOD WILL SHE BEGAN GENTLY CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU FOR A MOMENT OR TWO LONGER
YOUR HUSBAND BY LAWFUL MARRIAGE BY MY PASTOR WE'LL SOON SEE HOW LAWFUL IT WAS REPLIED THE WOMAN WITH A BITTER LAUGH I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME HOW OFTEN A MAN CAN BE MARRIED LAWFULLY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED ALIDA WITH A SUDDEN FLASH IN HER BLUE EYES THEN AS IF REPROACHING HERSELF SHE ADDED KINDLY PARDON ME I SEE YOU ARE NOT WELL
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE OTHER THAN THE SAME COLD QUESTIONING SCRUTINY AS IF INSTEAD OF A SWEET FACED WOMAN SOMETHING MONSTROUSLY UNNATURAL WAS PRESENT AT LAST IN SLOW ICY UTTERANCE CAME THE WORDS
REPLIED ALIDA WITH QUIET DIGNITY MY HUSBAND WILL BE HOME SOON AND HE WILL PROTECT ME YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ENTER MY ROOMS AND ACT AS YOU DO IF YOU ARE SICK AND IN TROUBLE
I'M SORRY FOR YOU MY GOOD WOMAN SHE BEGAN KINDLY YOU ARE LABORING UNDER SOME MISTAKE MY HUSBAND YOUR HUSBAND EXCLAIMED THE STRANGER WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE ACCENT OF SCORN AND REPROACH YES
CHAPTER SEVEN FROM HOME TO THE STREET AS THE SHADOWS OF THE GLOOMY MARCH EVENING DEEPENED ALIDA LIGHTED THE LAMP AND WAS THEN A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR A KNOCK AT THE DOOR NO PRESENTIMENT OF TROUBLE CROSSED HER MIND
CARRYING A CHILD THAT WAS PARTLY HIDDEN BY A THIN SHAWL THEIR ONLY OUTER PROTECTION AGAINST THE CHILL WINDS WHICH HAD BEEN BLUSTERING ALL DAY ALIDA LOOKED AT THE STRANGER INQUIRINGLY AND KINDLY EXPECTING AN APPEAL FOR CHARITY
THE WOMAN SANK INTO A CHAIR AS IF EXHAUSTED AND FIXED HER DARK HOLLOW EYES ON MISSUS OSTROM SHE APPEARED CONSUMED BY A TERRIBLE CURIOSITY ALIDA WONDERED AT THE STRANGE CHILL OF APPREHENSION
SO YOU ARE HER IS THIS WOMAN INSANE THOUGHT ALIDA WHY ELSE DOES SHE LOOK AT ME SO OH THAT WILSON WOULD COME

FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP
AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
CHAPTER FIVE THE SEAL AND THE BEAR YOU KNOW DOCTOR SAID HATTERAS AS THEY RETURNED TO THE HUT THE POLAR BEARS SUBSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SEALS THEY'LL LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM BESIDE THE CREVASSES FOR WHOLE DAYS
HE HAD AIMED WELL AND FIRED WITH A SURE AND STEADY AIM BEFORE EITHER OF HIS COMPANIONS CAME UP HE HAD PLUNGED THE KNIFE IN THE ANIMAL'S THROAT AND MADE AN END OF HIM FOR HE FELL DOWN AT ONCE TO RISE NO MORE
THE DOCTOR COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HIMSELF SO HE FOLLOWED HATTERAS SILENTLY TO THE SLEDGE TAKING WITH HIM A COUPLE OF HATCHETS FOR HIS OWN AND JOHNSON'S USE HATTERAS SOON MADE HIS TOILETTE AND SLIPPED INTO THE SKIN
BUT STOPPED SHORT STUPEFIED AND FRIGHTENED WITHIN THREE STEPS OF HATTERAS WHO STARTED UP THAT MOMENT AND THROWING OFF HIS DISGUISE KNELT ON ONE KNEE AND AIMED STRAIGHT AT THE BEAR'S HEART
YES BUT THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF SUCCESS THAN IN TRYING ANY OTHER PLAN SO I MEAN TO RISK IT I AM GOING TO DRESS MYSELF IN THE SEAL'S SKIN AND CREEP ALONG THE ICE COME DON'T LET US LOSE TIME LOAD THE GUN AND GIVE IT ME
THE BEAR WAS STILL THERE BUT MOVING RESTLESSLY ABOUT AS IF HE FELT THE APPROACH OF DANGER IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO THE SEAL MADE HIS APPEARANCE ON THE ICE HE HAD GONE A GOOD WAY ROUND SO AS TO COME ON THE BEAR BY SURPRISE
COURAGE HATTERAS SAID THE DOCTOR HANDING HIM THE WEAPON WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY LOADED MEANWHILE NEVER FEAR BUT BE SURE YOU DON'T SHOW YOURSELVES TILL I FIRE THE DOCTOR SOON JOINED THE OLD BOATSWAIN BEHIND THE HUMMOCK AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING
READY TO STRANGLE THEM THE MOMENT THEIR HEADS APPEAR ABOVE THE SURFACE IT IS NOT LIKELY THEN THAT A BEAR WILL BE FRIGHTENED OF A SEAL I THINK I SEE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER BUT IT IS DANGEROUS
NOW THEN GIVE ME THE GUN HE SAID
HURRYING TOWARDS HATTERAS FOR THE BEAR HAD REARED ON HIS HIND LEGS AND WAS STRIKING THE AIR WITH ONE PAW AND TEARING UP THE SNOW TO STANCH HIS WOUND WITH THE OTHER HATTERAS NEVER MOVED BUT WAITED KNIFE IN HAND
AND EVERY MOVEMENT WAS SO PERFECT AN IMITATION OF A SEAL THAT EVEN THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN IT WAS HATTERAS IT IS CAPITAL SAID JOHNSON IN A LOW VOICE THE BEAR HAD INSTANTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SUPPOSED SEAL FOR HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP
PREPARING TO MAKE A SPRING AS THE ANIMAL CAME NEARER
BRUIN WENT TO WORK WITH EXTREME PRUDENCE THOUGH HIS EYES GLARED WITH GREEDY DESIRE TO CLUTCH THE COVETED PREY FOR HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN FASTING A MONTH IF NOT TWO HE ALLOWED HIS VICTIM TO GET WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND
WOULD ALWAYS ENABLE HIM TO COCK HIS TAIL AND BARK BEFORE THE COMPANY WITH ALL THE COURAGE OF MY LADY'S PUG WOULD YOU DO ME THE GREAT HONOUR TO INTRODUCE ME TO HIS GRACE
THIS IS MAJOR TIFTO YES MY LORD DUKE I AM MAJOR TIFTO THE DUKE BOWED GRACIOUSLY MY FATHER AND I WERE ENGAGED ABOUT PRIVATE MATTERS SAID SILVERBRIDGE I BEG TEN THOUSAND PARDONS EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR
I DID NOT INTEND TO INTRUDE I THINK WE HAD DONE SAID THE DUKE PRAY SIT DOWN MAJOR TIFTO THE MAJOR SAT DOWN THOUGH NOW I BETHINK MYSELF I HAVE TO BEG YOUR PARDON THAT I A STRANGER
SHOULD ASK YOU TO SIT DOWN IN YOUR OWN CLUB DON'T MENTION IT MY LORD DUKE I AM SO UNUSED TO CLUBS THAT I FORGOT WHERE I WAS QUITE SO MY LORD DUKE I HOPE YOU THINK THAT SILVERBRIDGE IS LOOKING WELL
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN MAJOR TIFTO AND THE DUKE I BEG YOUR PARDON SILVERBRIDGE SAID THE MAJOR ENTERING THE ROOM BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR LONGSTAFF
SILVERBRIDGE WAS NOT PRONE TO TURN HIS BACK UPON A FRIEND BECAUSE HE WAS LOW IN THE WORLD HE HAD BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE BY CONNECTING HIMSELF WITH THE MAJOR BUT AT THE CLUB HE ALWAYS DEFENDED HIS PARTNER
THOUGH HE NOT UNFREQUENTLY FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO SNUB THE MAJOR HIMSELF HE ALWAYS COUNTENANCED THE LITTLE MASTER OF HOUNDS AND WAS TRUE TO HIS OWN IDEA OF STANDING TO A FELLOW
HE ISN'T HERE SAID SILVERBRIDGE WHO DID NOT WISH TO BE INTERRUPTED BY HIS RACING FRIEND YOUR FATHER I BELIEVE SAID TIFTO HE WAS RED IN THE FACE BUT WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS PERHAPS IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE BY HIS LIQUOR
YES YES I THINK SO SILVERBRIDGE BIT HIS LIPS AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY TO THE DOOR WE DIDN'T MAKE A VERY GOOD THING OF OUR DERBY NAG THE OTHER DAY PERHAPS YOUR GRACE HAS HEARD ALL THAT
IN HIS MORE SOBER MOMENTS HE WAS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO ASSUME THAT APPEARANCE OF EQUALITY WITH HIS COMPANIONS WHICH IT WAS THE AMBITION OF HIS SOUL TO ACHIEVE BUT A SECOND GLASS OF WHISKY AND WATER
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT WISH TO INTRODUCE HIS FRIEND TO HIS FATHER THE DUKE SAW IT ALL AT A GLANCE AND FELT THAT THE INTRODUCTION SHOULD BE MADE PERHAPS SAID HE GETTING UP FROM HIS CHAIR
HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
CAREERING HOMEWARD AND THROUGH THIS CHANNEL OF POVERTY AND INACTION THE CONTINENT SPED ITS WEALTH AND INDUSTRY NOW AND AGAIN THE CLUMPS OF PEOPLE RAISED THE CHEER OF THE GRATEFULLY OPPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY HOWEVER WAS FOR THE BLUE CARS
HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
IN FACT THESE FOUR YOUNG MEN WERE ALMOST HILARIOUS THEY WERE CHARLES SEGOUIN THE OWNER OF THE CAR ANDRE RIVIERE A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN OF CANADIAN BIRTH A HUGE HUNGARIAN NAMED VILLONA
THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
AND HAD AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO DUBLIN UNIVERSITY TO STUDY LAW JIMMY DID NOT STUDY VERY EARNESTLY AND TOOK TO BAD COURSES FOR A WHILE HE HAD MONEY AND HE WAS POPULAR AND HE DIVIDED HIS TIME CURIOUSLY BETWEEN MUSICAL AND MOTORING CIRCLES
AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
WITH SUNK DARK EYES UNDER A LARGE SQUARE FOREHEAD COMPLEXION DESTITUTE OF BLOOM OR ATTRACTION SOMETHING YOUNG BUT NOT YOUTHFUL NO OBJECT TO WIN A LADY'S LOVE NO BUTT FOR THE SHAFTS OF CUPID
AND NO DRESSING CAN MAKE ME SO THEREFORE I'LL GO AS I AM AND OFF I STARTED CURSORILY GLANCING SIDEWAYS AS I PASSED THE TOILET TABLE SURMOUNTED BY A LOOKING GLASS A THIN IRREGULAR FACE I SAW
THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF APRIL THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK LONG
WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE
PERMISSION TO ACCEPT SUCH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT SHOULD IT OFFER HAVING FORMED AN ARTICLE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED ME IT WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED IN THE COURSE OF NEXT DAY
IN A MOMENT I HAD PULLED THE BELL IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WITHIN APPEARED A PASSAGE PAVED ALTERNATELY WITH BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE THE WALLS WERE PAINTED IN IMITATION OF MARBLE ALSO AND AT THE FAR END OPENED A GLASS DOOR
THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
A LARGE LUSTRE PENDENT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING MIRRORS CONSOLES MUSLIN CURTAINS AND A HANDSOME CENTRE TABLE COMPLETED THE INVENTORY OF FURNITURE ALL LOOKED EXTREMELY CLEAN AND GLITTERING
SHE IS SOME STIFF OLD MAID FOR THOUGH THE DAUGHTER OF MADAME REUTER SHE MAY WELL NUMBER UPWARDS OF FORTY WINTERS BESIDES IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF SHE BE BOTH YOUNG AND PRETTY I AM NOT HANDSOME
I REMEMBER VERY WELL THAT BEFORE QUITTING MY CHAMBER I HELD A BRIEF DEBATE WITH MYSELF AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD CHANGE MY ORDINARY ATTIRE FOR SOMETHING SMARTER AT LAST I CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF LABOUR DOUBTLESS THOUGHT I
WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
BUT THE LADY SEEMED TO HESITATE AND ASKED FOR A WEEK TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS SHOWED SO MUCH INGRATITUDE ON HER PART WAS SO POOR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE POSITION WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HER THAT HE WAS INCLINED TO BE INDIGNANT
CHAPTER NINETEEN DICK TAKES HIS FINAL LEAVE
AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS ALTIFIORLA SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED HE DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE HIMSELF ALTOGETHER ALONE IN THE WORLD AND IF THIS DICK WERE DISMISSED IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER UNLESS HE WERE MINDED TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH A WIFE INSTEAD
AND DICK HAD AT FIRST BEEN RESTRAINED BY THIS MAN'S PRESENCE AS SOON AS HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH SIR FRANCIS HE BEGAN LADY GRANT HAS GONE OFF TO DRESDEN HE SAID WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT ASKED THE BARONET THEY TOLD ME SO AT THE CLUB
DICK WENT INTO PERTH WHICH WAS TWENTY MILES DISTANT FROM THE BARONET'S SHOOTING LODGE AND RETURNED THE SAME DAY BRINGING THE POSTBAG WITH HIM FROM A POINT IN THE ROAD AT WHICH IT WAS DAILY LEFT BY THE POSTMAN SIR FRANCIS WITH UNUSUAL HASTE READ HIS LETTERS
AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE FROM MISS ALTIFIORLA BUT DICK HAD A BUDGET OF NEWS WHICH HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REVEAL AND WHICH HE DID TELL BEFORE SIR FRANCIS HAD SAID ANYTHING AS TO HIS OWN LETTER THERE WAS ANOTHER FRIEND ONE CAPTAIN FAWKES AT THE LODGE WITH THEM
HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER WARM AFFECTION AND AT ONCE ACCEPTED ALL THAT HAD BEEN PROFFERED THE GENTLEMAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LEARNT AT ONCE TO DESPISE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED SO EASILY AS IT WAS HE WAS SIMPLY CROSS AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW THE PROPOSAL
BUT STILL THE OTHER LETTER WAS TO COME AND MISS ALTIFIORLA'S CHANCE WAS STILL OPEN TO HER THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DOUBTS IN THE MIND OF SIR FRANCIS WAS A POSTPONEMENT OF THE VERDICT OF BANISHMENT WHICH HE HAD RESOLVED TO PRONOUNCE AGAINST DICK
HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH IT
HE DESPISED THE BARONET ALMOST AS THOROUGHLY AS DID MISTER WESTERN BUT FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AS TO WHICH HE DESPISED HIMSELF ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE BARONET SUITED HIM JUST AT PRESENT ONE MORNING FOR PRIVATE REASONS OF HIS OWN
AS NO QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED HE HAD MADE NO REPLY
HE BECAME THEREFORE GRADUALLY MORE GRACIOUS AFTER THE LITTLE SPEECH WHICH HAS BEEN ABOVE GIVEN DICK HAD UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WHO THE SHE HAD BEEN
AND WHY WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF THEIRS SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT WHY HAS SHE GONE TO PERSUADE HER BROTHER TO COME HOME AND TAKE HIS WIFE ONCE MORE IT WAS AN INFERNAL SHAME THAT THEY SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN SEPARATED
IF SHE DON'T CARE ABOUT IT SHE SHA'N'T HAVE IT IT WAS THUS THAT HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF ALOUD IN THE HEARING OF DICK ROSS BUT WITHOUT HOWEVER EXPLAINING WHO THE SHE WAS OR WHAT THE IT WAS OR INDEED IN ANY WAY ASKING DICK'S OPINION ON THE MATTER
BUT HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ART CONFOUND HIM HE GAVE ME A LECTURE ON IT AND RECOMMENDED ME TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN TECHNIQUE I WONDER WHAT OLD KAMI WOULD HAVE SAID TO THAT
SAID DICK DELIBERATELY I LIKE THE POWER I LIKE THE FUN I LIKE THE FUSS AND ABOVE ALL I LIKE THE MONEY I ALMOST LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE FUSS AND PAY THE MONEY ALMOST BUT THEY'RE A QUEER GANG AN AMAZINGLY QUEER GANG
AND HE TURNED FROM HIS MEAL IN THE VILLAGER'S CLOSE AND HE BAYED TO THE MOON AS SHE ROSE IN SEONEE WELL AND HOW DOES SUCCESS TASTE
THE MARK OF MUDDY FEET ON THE DAIS SHOWED THAT A MILITARY MODEL HAD JUST GONE AWAY THE WATERY AUTUMN SUNLIGHT WAS FALLING AND SHADOWS SAT IN THE CORNERS OF THE STUDIO YES
LIMITED ISN'T THE WORD TO DESCRIBE EM I MET A FELLOW THE OTHER DAY WHO TOLD ME THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHADOWS ON WHITE SAND SHOULD BE BLUE ULTRAMARINE AS THEY ARE I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN AS FAR AS BRIGHTON BEACH
THE LEAN YEARS HAVE PASSED AND I APPROVE OF THESE FAT ONES BE CAREFUL OLD MAN THAT WAY LIES BAD WORK
TORPENHOW WAS SPRAWLING IN A LONG CHAIR WITH A SMALL FOX TERRIER ASLEEP ON HIS CHEST WHILE DICK WAS PREPARING A CANVAS A DAIS A BACKGROUND AND A LAY FIGURE WERE THE ONLY FIXED OBJECTS IN THE PLACE
HE KNEW WHERE THE DOE MADE A COUCH FOR HER FAWN AND HE LOOKED TO HIS STRENGTH FOR HIS PREY BUT THE MOON SWEPT THE SMOKE WREATHS AWAY
DID YOU SEE THAT THE PAPERS CALLED IT THE WILD WORK SHOW NEVER MIND I SOLD EVERY SHRED OF CANVAS I WANTED TO AND ON MY WORD I BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED I WAS A SELF TAUGHT FLAGSTONE ARTIST
THEY ROSE FROM A WRECK OF ODDMENTS THAT BEGAN WITH FELT COVERED WATER BOTTLES BELTS AND REGIMENTAL BADGES AND ENDED WITH A SMALL BALE OF SECOND HAND UNIFORMS AND A STAND OF MIXED ARMS
SAID TORPENHOW SOME THREE MONTHS LATER HE HAD JUST RETURNED TO CHAMBERS AFTER A HOLIDAY IN THE COUNTRY GOOD SAID DICK AS HE SAT LICKING HIS LIPS BEFORE THE EASEL IN THE STUDIO I WANT MORE HEAPS MORE
WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
SANDY TIPTON THOUGHT IT WAS ROUGH ON SAL AND IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF HER CONDITION FOR A MOMENT ROSE SUPERIOR TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD AN ACE AND TWO BOWERS IN HIS SLEEVE IT WILL BE SEEN ALSO THAT THE SITUATION WAS NOVEL
DEATHS WERE BY NO MEANS UNCOMMON IN ROARING CAMP BUT A BIRTH WAS A NEW THING PEOPLE HAD BEEN DISMISSED THE CAMP EFFECTIVELY FINALLY AND WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF RETURN BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYBODY HAD BEEN INTRODUCED A B INITIO
PERHAPS THERE WAS A FITNESS IN THE SELECTION STUMPY IN OTHER CLIMES HAD BEEN THE PUTATIVE HEAD OF TWO FAMILIES IN FACT IT WAS OWING TO SOME LEGAL INFORMALITY IN THESE PROCEEDINGS THAT ROARING CAMP A CITY OF REFUGE
HENCE THE EXCITEMENT YOU GO IN THERE STUMPY SAID A PROMINENT CITIZEN KNOWN AS KENTUCK ADDRESSING ONE OF THE LOUNGERS GO IN THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU KIN DO YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THEM THINGS
WAS INDEBTED TO HIS COMPANY THE CROWD APPROVED THE CHOICE AND STUMPY WAS WISE ENOUGH TO BOW TO THE MAJORITY THE DOOR CLOSED ON THE EXTEMPORE SURGEON AND MIDWIFE AND ROARING CAMP SAT DOWN OUTSIDE SMOKED ITS PIPE AND AWAITED THE ISSUE
BUT THE NAME OF A WOMAN WAS FREQUENTLY REPEATED IT WAS A NAME FAMILIAR ENOUGH IN THE CAMP CHEROKEE SAL PERHAPS THE LESS SAID OF HER THE BETTER SHE WAS A COARSE AND IT IS TO BE FEARED A VERY SINFUL WOMAN
THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP THERE WAS COMMOTION IN ROARING CAMP IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FIGHT FOR IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THAT WAS NOT NOVEL ENOUGH TO HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE ENTIRE SETTLEMENT
WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED THE MINISTRATION OF HER OWN SEX DISSOLUTE ABANDONED AND IRRECLAIMABLE SHE WAS YET SUFFERING A MARTYRDOM HARD ENOUGH TO BEAR EVEN WHEN VEILED BY SYMPATHIZING WOMANHOOD
THE DITCHES AND CLAIMS WERE NOT ONLY DESERTED BUT TUTTLE'S GROCERY HAD CONTRIBUTED ITS GAMBLERS WHO IT WILL BE REMEMBERED CALMLY CONTINUED THEIR GAME THE DAY THAT FRENCH PETE AND KANAKA JOE SHOT EACH OTHER TO DEATH
THE WHOLE CAMP WAS COLLECTED BEFORE A RUDE CABIN ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CLEARING
THAT AT A MOMENT WHEN SHE MOST LACKED HER SEX'S INTUITIVE TENDERNESS AND CARE
BUT NOW TERRIBLE IN HER LONELINESS THE PRIMAL CURSE HAD COME TO HER IN THAT ORIGINAL ISOLATION WHICH MUST HAVE MADE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE FIRST TRANSGRESSION SO DREADFUL IT WAS PERHAPS PART OF THE EXPIATION OF HER SIN
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS TOO LATE NO UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T HE GOT THE TWO POUNDS THE MOST EXPENSIVE CIGARETTE I'VE EVER SMOKED WELL THAT JUST SHOWS YOU SAID HERBERT HERE'S YOUR TICKET PUT IT IN YOUR WAISTCOAT POCKET NOW
AH WELL THAT LEAVES A PENNY HA'PENNY TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PORTER THIS END LUNCH TEA THE PORTER THE OTHER END AND THE CAB I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ENOUGH EVEN IF I GAVE IT ALL TO THE PORTER HERE THINK HOW REPROACHFULLY HE WOULD LOOK AT YOU EVER AFTERWARDS
IT WOULD HAUNT YOU THE STATION MASTER WAS EVIDENTLY MOVED HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ASKED IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO WOULD VOUCH FOR ME I MENTIONED HERBERT CONFIDENTLY HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HERBERT
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT GETTING UP WHEN HE CAME INTO MY ROOM HE LOOKED AT ME IN HORROR MY DEAR FELLOW HE SAID AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PACKED YOU'LL BE LATE HERE GET UP AND I'LL PACK FOR YOU WHILE YOU DRESS DO I SAID BRIEFLY FIRST OF ALL WHAT CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRAVEL IN
BECAUSE I HAD LEFT MY TICKET ON THE DRESSING TABLE AFTER ALL I GAVE MY LUGGAGE TO A PORTER AND WENT OFF TO THE STATION MASTER I WONDER IF YOU CAN HELP ME I SAID
AND I DROVE AWAY AMIDST CHEERS CHEERS OF SORROW IT WAS HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE TO THE STATION
WELL WE NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT I'VE LEFT IT AT HOME HE DIDN'T SEEM INTENSELY EXCITED WHAT DID YOU THINK OF DOING HE ASKED I HAD RATHER HOPED THAT YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY ANOTHER TICKET AND GET THE MONEY BACK AFTERWARDS
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND THE TRAP STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR HELP I CRIED AND I LEAPT OUT OF BED HALF AN HOUR LATER I WAS SAYING GOOD BYE TO HERBERT I'VE HAD AN AWFULLY JOLLY TIME I SAID AND I'LL COME AGAIN YOU'VE GOT THE TICKET ALL RIGHT RATHER
YES YES BUT CAN I I'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT ONE POUND SIX
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT I SAT UP IN BED AND DIRECTED OPERATIONS RIGHT SAID HERBERT NOW WHAT ABOUT YOUR RETURN TICKET YOU MUSTN'T FORGET THAT YOU REMIND ME OF A LITTLE STORY I SAID I'LL TELL IT YOU WHILE YOU PACK THAT WILL BE NICE FOR YOU
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A WAISTCOAT ON SILLY WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ON I DON'T KNOW YET THIS IS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRES THOUGHT GIVE ME TIME GIVE ME AIR
ONCE UPON A TIME I LOST MY RETURN TICKET AND I HAD TO PAY TWO POUNDS FOR ANOTHER AND A MONTH AFTERWARDS I MET A MAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT TICKETS AND HE SAID YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE MONEY BACK IF YOU HAD APPLIED AT ONCE SO I SAID
PATTY POISED THE PENCIL A MOMENT AND ABSTRACTEDLY TRACED THE NAME KATE FERRIS GEORGIE LAUGHED IF THERE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE A KATE FERRIS IN COLLEGE SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO FIND HERSELF A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN CLUB
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER PRISCILLA WAS ENGAGED IN LABORIOUSLY TURNING THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING INTO GRAMMATICAL GERMAN AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF SHE REMARKED TO PATTY DO YOU KNOW
THE ELUSIVE KATE FERRIS THE MYSTERIOUS KATE FERRIS
THE FRESHMEN ARE SIMPLY SCRAMBLING TO GET IN THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW FRAEULEIN SCHERIN HOW MUCH INTEREST THEY TAKE IN THE SUBJECT GEORGIE LAUGHED PATTY PICKED UP THE PENCIL WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
THE STUDY HAS BEEN SO FULL OF FRESHMEN ALL THE TIME THAT I TOLD HER TO HANG IT ON THE DOOR AND LET THEM JOIN OUTSIDE IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY PATTY TURNED THE LEAVES AND RAN HER EYES DOWN THE LIST OF SPRAWLING SIGNATURES IT'S A POPULAR ORGANIZATION ISN'T IT
I KNOW PRISCILLA WOULD BE GRATIFIED NO THANK YOU I PAY CLUB DUES ENOUGH ALREADY I'M AFRAID I'M NOT EXACTLY ELIGIBLE MYSELF AS I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY SHARP PENCIL THOUGH THAT I HATE NOT TO WRITE WITH IT
SHE ISN'T A SOPHOMORE THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED SHE MUST BE A FRESHMAN PRISCILLA LOOK AGAIN
GEORGIE STOPPED TO EXAMINE SOME LOOSE SHEETS OF PAPER WHICH WERE IMPALED UPON THE DOOR WHAT'S THIS PATTY OH THAT'S THE REGISTRATION LIST FOR THE GERMAN CLUB PRISCILLA'S SECRETARY YOU KNOW AND EVERY ONE WHO WANTS TO JOIN COMES HERE
AND THE INCIDENT WAS FORGOTTEN A FEW DAYS LATER THE TWO CAME IN FROM CLASS TO FIND PRISCILLA AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN CLUB SITTING ON THE DIVAN WITH THEIR HEADS TOGETHER FRANTICALLY TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE CATALOGUE
PRISCILLA PRODUCED THE REGISTRATION LIST AND TRIUMPHANTLY EXHIBITED AN UNMISTAKABLE KATE FERRIS THEY FORGOT TO PUT HER IN THE CATALOGUE I NEVER KNEW THEM TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE BEFORE SAID THE PRESIDENT DUBIOUSLY I DON'T BELIEVE WE'D BETTER PUT HER IN THE ROLL BOOK
FOR A WHOLE SEMESTER ENTERED UPON HER COLLEGE CAREER IN AN ENTIRELY UNPREMEDITATED AND IMPROMPTU MANNER IT BEGAN ONE DAY AWAY BACK IN NOVEMBER
GEORGIE AND PATTY EXCHANGED GLANCES AND INQUIRED THE TROUBLE A GIRL NAMED KATE FERRIS HAS REGISTERED FOR THE GERMAN CLUB AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE CLASSES AND THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY SUCH GIRL IN COLLEGE POSSIBLY A SPECIAL
HERE WHATEVER IS HARD INTERFERES WITH THE SPACE ITS NEIGHBORS OCCUPY IT DENTS THEM IS IMPENETRABLE BY THEM AND WE CALL THE HARDNESS THEN A PHYSICAL HARDNESS
BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
FOR THE COUNT WAS GOING TO HUNT THE WILD BOAR PRESENTLY AWAY THEY WENT WITH THE MERRY MUSIC OF HORNS THE CLATTER OF HOOFS AND THE BLITHE RING OF VOICES TILL THE PLEASANT CLAMOR DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANT WOODS
IN THE COURTYARD HOUNDS BRAYED HORSES PRANCED
BUT ALL WAS QUIET AND DESERTED NOW SO WITH A BOYISH LAUGH AND A DARING GLANCE AT THE DANGEROUS DESCENT HE SAID TO THE DOVES COOING ON THE ROOF OVERHEAD
WHEN IT RESTED ON A BLUE GOWNED WHITE CAPPED FIGURE SPRINKLING WEBS OF LINEN SPREAD TO BLEACH IN THE GREEN MEADOW BY THE RIVER RANCE IF I MAY NOT HUNT
A BOY'S FACE LOOKED OUT FULL OF EAGER LONGING A FINE STRONG FACE BUT SULLEN NOW WITH BLACK BROWS DARK RESTLESS EYES AND LIPS SET
THE GRAY TOWER OF THE GOOD DUCHESS ANNE WAS HUNG WITH GARLANDS OF IVY AND GAY WITH TUFTS OF FRAGRANT WALLFLOWERS AND ALONG THE FOSSE THE SHADOWS DEEPENED DAILY AS THE YOUNG LEAVES THICKENED ON THE INTERLACING BRANCHES OVERHEAD
SHOOK THEIR HIGH COLLARS TILL THE BELLS RANG AGAIN AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE ROADS THAT WOUND BETWEEN WIDE FIELDS OF COLZA BUCKWHEAT AND CLOVER UP AT THE CHATEAU
WHERE MISTLETOE CLUNG TO THE GREAT OAKS AND MENHIRS AND DOLMENS
AS IF REBELLIOUS THOUGHTS WERE STIRRING IN HIS MIND HE WATCHED THE GAY CAVALCADE DISAPPEAR UNTIL A SUNNY SILENCE SETTLED OVER THE LANDSCAPE BROKEN ONLY BY THE LARKS AND THE SOUND OF A GIRL'S VOICE SINGING AS HE LISTENED
WOODEN SHOES CLATTERED TO AND FRO AS THE GIRLS BROUGHT WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN IN PLACE SAINT LOUIS MEN WITH THEIR LONG HAIR EMBROIDERED JACKETS AND BAGGY BREECHES DRANK CIDER AT THE INN DOORS AND THE GREAT BRETON HORSES
WHICH STOOD NEAR THE RUINS OF THE ANCIENT CASTLE THE GREAT BANNER STREAMED IN THE WIND SHOWING AS ITS FOLDS BLEW OUT THE DEVICE AND MOTTO OF THE BEAUMANOIR TWO CLASPED HANDS AND THE LEGEND
THE BOY STRUCK A VOLUME THAT LAY ON THE WIDE LEDGE WITH A PETULANT ENERGY THAT SENT IT FLUTTERING DOWN INTO THE COURT YARD BELOW HALF ASHAMED AND HALF AMUSED YOUNG GASTON PEEPED TO SEE IF THIS RANDOM SHOT HAD HIT ANY ONE
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD PAY IT BACK TO HER DURING THE COMING YEAR AND COMFORTING HER HEART BY HIS REJOICING THAT THE PROPERTY HAD NOT BEEN SOLD I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH AN ACRE OF IT HE HAD SAID OF COURSE NOT LUDOVIC
LADY LUFTON WAS NOT A WOMAN WHO ALLOWED HER LIFE TO BE WHAT PEOPLE IN COMMON PARLANCE CALL DULL SHE HAD TOO MANY DUTIES AND THOUGHT TOO MUCH OF THEM
BUT NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE WAS MORE JOYOUS TO HER WHEN HE WAS THERE THERE WAS A REASON FOR SOME LITTLE GAIETY WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED THITHER BY HERSELF BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE DID ENJOY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY HIS PRESENCE
CHAPTER THIRTEEN DELICATE HINTS LADY LUFTON HAD BEEN GREATLY REJOICED AT THAT GOOD DEED WHICH HER SON DID IN GIVING UP HIS LEICESTERSHIRE HUNTING AND COMING TO RESIDE FOR THE WINTER AT FRAMLEY IT WAS PROPER AND BECOMING
MANY A NIGHT AS SHE LAY THINKING ON HER PILLOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT NO MONEY HAD EVER BEEN BETTER EXPENDED SINCE IT HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK TO HIS OWN HOUSE HE HAD THANKED HER FOR IT IN HIS OWN OPEN WAY
ON HER LITTLE OLD WORLD PREJUDICES IN A TONE THAT WAS MUSICAL TO HER EAR AS COMING FROM HIM SMILING ON HER REMINDING HER OF THOSE SMILES WHICH SHE HAD LOVED SO DEARLY WHEN AS YET HE WAS ALL HER OWN
LYING THERE IN HIS LITTLE BED BESIDE HER CHAIR HE WAS KIND AND GRACIOUS TO HER BEHAVING LIKE A GOOD SON AT ANY RATE WHILE HE WAS THERE IN HER PRESENCE WHEN WE ADD TO THIS
AND COMFORTABLE IN THE EXTREME AN ENGLISH NOBLEMAN OUGHT TO HUNT IN THE COUNTY WHERE HE HIMSELF OWNS THE FIELDS OVER WHICH HE RIDES HE OUGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESPECT AND HONOUR DUE TO HIM FROM HIS OWN TENANTS HE OUGHT TO SLEEP UNDER A ROOF OF HIS OWN
SHE WAS YOUNGER AND BRIGHTER WHEN HE WAS THERE THINKING MORE OF THE FUTURE AND LESS OF THE PAST SHE COULD LOOK AT HIM AND THAT ALONE WAS HAPPINESS TO HER AND THEN HE WAS PLEASANT MANNERED WITH HER JOKING WITH HER
AND HE OUGHT ALSO SO LADY LUFTON THOUGHT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG EMBRYO BRIDE OF HIS OWN MOTHER'S CHOOSING AND THEN IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HIM THERE IN THE HOUSE
HER FEARS THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SO PERFECT IN HIS CONDUCT WHEN ABSENT WE MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT LADY LUFTON WAS PLEASED TO HAVE HIM THERE AT FRAMLEY COURT SHE HAD HARDLY SAID A WORD TO HIM AS TO THAT FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
THERE IS NOTHING SO AMAZING TO HIM AS TO FIND THAT ANY ONE REALLY ENJOYS HIS STUFF POOR SOUL HE REMEMBERS HOW HE GROANED OVER IT AT HIS DESK HE REMEMBERS THE HOURS HE SAT WITH LACK LUSTRE EYE AND ADDLED BRAIN
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL CROWN A COLYUMIST LAUREATE SOME MAJESTIC SAGE WITH ANCIENT PATIENT BLUE EYES AND A SNOWY BEARD NOBLY STAINED WITH NICOTINE WHOSE UTTERANCES WILL BE HEEDED WITH SHUDDERING RESPECT
IF THE PUBLIC INSISTS ON BRINGING ITS WOES TO ITS COLYUMISTS IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY COLYUMISTS THEN THE BATTERED JESTER TURNS AGAIN TO HIS MACHINE AND TICKS OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I FIND A MEMORANDUM OF IT IN MY SCRAP BOOK HUMORIST YOUNG AND UNTAMED LINEAL DESCENDENT OF EUGENE FIELD FRANK STOCKTON AND FRANCOIS RABELAIS DESIRES TO RUN A COLUMN IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
A GUARANTEED CIRCULATION GETTER SAID HUMORIST CAN ALSO SUPPLY EXCELLENT VEINS OF PHILOSOPHY POETRY SATIRE UPLIFT GLAD MATERIAL AND INDISCRIMINATE MUSINGS
AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
TO PEER THROUGH THE FRONTAGE OF THE EXPERIENCE TO FIND SOME GLIMMER OF THE THOUGHTS EMOTIONS AND MEANINGS BEHIND AND IN THE LONG RUN SUCH A HABIT OF INQUIRY MUST BEAR FRUIT IN UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY JOSEPH CONRAD
IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
IT IS HARD TO GET THE COLYUMIST TO ADMIT THIS FOR HE FEARS SPOOFING WORSE THAN THE DEVIL BUT IT IS EMINENTLY TRUE IF I WERE THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER
TO CHURN UP FROM THE TYPEWRITER SOME LYRIC THAT WILL ROCK WITH BLUE SEAS AND FRANTIC HEARTS
THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
THE MOST PAINFUL PRIVILEGE OF THE COLYUMIST'S JOB IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DROP IN TO SEE HIM USUALLY WHEN HE IS IMPRECATING HIS WAY TOWARD THE HOUR OF GOING TO PRESS THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE GREAT AND SALUTARY HUMAN INSTINCT AGAINST WORK
DARE ONE SAY BEAUTY AND PHRASE THEM INTELLIGIBLY BUT IT IS FUN ONE NEVER BUYS A PACKAGE OF TOBACCO CROSSES A CITY SQUARE ENTERS A TROLLEY CAR OR STUDIES A SHOP WINDOW WITHOUT TRYING IN A BAFFLED HOPELESS WAY
HE FINDS THAT HIS MOST AUGUST MUSINGS HAVE A HABIT OF STEWING THEMSELVES DOWN TO SOME FEROCIOUS OR JOCULAR THREE LINE COMMENT
POOR SOUL HE IS LIKE ONE CONDEMNED TO HARANGUE THE VAST IDIOTIC WORLD THROUGH A KEYHOLE WHENCE HIS ANGUISH ISSUES THIN AND FAINT YET WHO WILL SAY THAT ALL HIS LABOUR IS WHOLLY VAIN
I INSTANCE THIS TO SHOW THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO BEGIN HIS JOB WITH THE CONCEPTION THAT IT IS TO BE A PERPETUAL UPROAR OF MIRTH AND HIGH SPIRITS THIS LASTS ABOUT A WEEK
REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY NEWSPAPER DESIRING A REALLY UNUSUAL EDITORIAL FEATURE ADDRESS HUMORIST ET CETERA SO BESOTTED WAS I I WOULD HAVE PAID TO HAVE THIS PRINTED IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSELLED BY AN OLDER AND WISER HEAD
THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST
WHICH IS NOT A GRIN SO MUCH WITH APOLOGY FOR THE IDEALS OF THE COLYUMIST IF HE BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR OF MOCKERY OF COURSE IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS AND TRAVAIL OF HIS JOB YOU WILL FIND HIM FAR DIFFERENT
HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THE MOST ELUSIVE AND GROTESQUE MATERIAL HE KNOWS HIS OWN MIND AND THE UNHAPPY CREATURE EVERLASTINGLY PROBING HIMSELF IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS SO RARE IN MINDS A THOUGHT IS LIKELY TO END IN A FERMENT OF BITTERNESS
WITH ANYTHING BUT HUMILITY AND DESPAIR FRANK HARRIS ONCE SAID OF OSCAR WILDE IF ENGLAND INSISTS ON TREATING HER CRIMINALS LIKE THIS SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY SIMILARLY
CAME VERY NEAR ENDING AS A COMPLETE CYNIC THOUGH IN WHAT F P A WOULD CALL HIS LASTLINE HE MANAGED TO WRIGGLE INTO A MORE HOPEFUL MOOD THE FIRST VALUABLE DISCOVERY THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO MAKE IS THAT ALL MINDS ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME
IF YOU HAVE TO BE ENDLESSLY SPECULATING WATCHING AND MAKING MENTAL NOTES YOUR BRAIN GEARS SOON GET A HOT BOX THE ORIGINAL OF ALL PARAGRAPHERS
ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
THERE HE STOOD A SORT OF UNSUCCESSFUL CYRUS CURTIS VERY DIMINUTIVE HIS GRAY HAIR RATHER LONG ABAFT HIS NECK HIS YELLOWISH STRAW HAT WITH CURLY BRIM TILTED BACKWARD AS THOUGH IN PERPLEXITY
THE DOCTORS TELL US THAT ALL PATENT MEDICINES ARE BUILT ON A STOCK FORMULA A SEDATIVE A PURGE AND A BITTER IF YOU ARE TO MAKE STEADY COLUMN TOPERS OUT OF YOUR READERS YOUR DAILY DOSE MUST
A PESSIMIST HE SAYS IS A MAN WHO WEARS BOTH BELT AND SUSPENDERS WHEN A BIG JEWELLERY FIRM IN THE CITY PUTS OUT A LARGE AD BAILEY BANKS AND BIDDLE COMPANY WATCHES FOR WOMEN OF SUPERIOR DESIGN AND PERFECTION OF MOVEMENT
ON THE STREETS MAKING HIMSELF THE REPORTER OF THE MOODS AND ODDITIES OF MEN THE BETTER HIS STUFF WILL BE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS JOB OUGHT TO BE GOOD TRAINING FOR A NOVELIST AS IT TEACHES HIM A HABIT OF HUMAN SENSITIVENESS
YET NOW AND THEN HE GETS A GLIMPSE INTO A HUMAN VEXATION SO SINCERE SO HONEST AND SO MOVING THAT HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE TYPEWRITER WITH A SIGH HE WONDERS HOW ONE DARE APPROACH THE CHRONICLING OF THIS MUDDLED PANORAMA
HE BECOMES FILLED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CURIOSITY ABOUT THE MOTIVES AND PURPOSES OF THE PEOPLE HE SEES
THE FOLLOWING WORDS FROM ISAIAH THE BEST OF ALL WATCHWORDS FOR ALL WHO WRITE WOE UNTO THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER
HIS TIMID AND ABSORBED BLUE EYES PORING OVER HIS MEMORANDUM BOOK WHICH WAS FULL OF PENCILLED NOTES HE HAD A SLIGHTLY UNKEMPT BRIEF BEARD AND WHISKERS HIS CHEEK BONES PINKISH HIS LINEN A LITTLE FRAYED THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY PATHETIC ABOUT HIM
OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AVERAGE UP TO THAT SAME PRESCRIPTION IF YOU EMPLOY THE PURGE ALL THE TIME OR THE SEDATIVE OR THE ACID YOUR CLIENTS WILL SOON ASK FOR SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER LABEL
YOU MAY KNOW HIM BY A SUNKEN BROODING EYE CLOTHING MARRED BY MUCH TOBACCO AND A CHAFED AND TETCHY HUMOUR TOWARD THE HOUR OF FIVE P M HAVING BITTERLY SCHOOLED HIMSELF TO SEE MEN AS PARAGRAPHS WALKING
WHO SEEMS BY THE WAY TO BE MORE READ BY NEWSPAPER MEN THAN ANY OTHER WRITER PUT VERY NOBLY THE PINNACLE OF ALL SCRIBBLERS DREAMS WHEN HE SAID THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS DESERVE THE TRIBUTE OF A SIGH WHICH IS NOT A SOB A SMILE
I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A TRY AT WRITING A COLUMN HEAVEN HELP ME I THINK I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS BORN FOR THE JOB I MAY AS WELL BE CANDID THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF INSERTING THE FOLLOWING AD IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
AND IT IS CARRIED ON IN SURROUNDINGS OF EXTRAORDINARY STIMULATION AND DIFFICULTY IT IS HEART RACKING TO STRUGGLE DAY BY DAY AMID INCESSANT INTERRUPTION AND MELEE TO SNATCH OUT OF THE HURLY BURLY SOME SHREDS OF HUMOUR OR PATHOS OR
WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
SHE HASN'T PAID HER DUES AND AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT
PRISCILLA KNIT HER BROWS SHE COULDN'T HAVE COME I KEPT WATCHING FOR HER ALL THE EVENING IT'S STRANGE ISN'T IT WHEN SHE WAS SO CAREFUL TO SEND AN ACCEPTANCE I'M GROWING POSITIVELY
BUT PRISCILLA ALWAYS HAPPENED TO BE OUT HER NAME WAS POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD FOR HAVING LIBRARY BOOKS THAT WERE OVERDUE SHE EVEN WROTE A PAPER FOR ONE OF THE GERMAN CLUB MEETINGS GEORGIE WAS NOT A FACILE GERMAN SCHOLAR AND IT HAD REQUIRED A WHOLE SATURDAY
WHERE KATE FERRIS'S NAME HAD BEEN CHANGED HER MIND AGAIN PATTY ASKED PLEASANTLY SHE'S LEFT COLLEGE PRISCILLA SNAPPED AND DON'T YOU EVER MENTION HER NAME TO ME AGAIN PATTY SIGHED SYMPATHETICALLY AND REMARKED TO THE ROOM IN GENERAL
ON THE EVENING OF THE TEA AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE AND THE FURNITURE HAD BEEN MOVED BACK THE WEARY HOSTESSES IN SOMEWHAT RUMPLED EVENING DRESSES A CONSIDERABLE CRUSH RESULTS WHEN FIFTY ARE ENTERTAINED IN A ROOM WHOSE UTMOST CAPACITY IS FIFTEEN
A FEW WEEKS LATER SHE FOUND A SECOND NOTE ON HER DOOR BLOCK DEAR MISS POND AS I AM VERY BUSY WITH MY CLASS WORK I FIND THAT I HAVE NOT TIME TO ATTEND THE GERMAN CLUB MEETINGS AND SO HAVE DECIDED TO RESIGN
PRISCILLA KEPT HEARING ABOUT THE GIRL ON ALL SIDES BUT COULD NEVER CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HER
I'M AFRAID SO SIGHED PATTY IT'S BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING BUT SHE IS REALLY GETTING SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT AND I DON'T DARE MENTION KATE FERRIS'S NAME WHEN WE'RE ALONE
SHE INSISTS THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SUCH PERSON IN COLLEGE AND THAT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE NAME DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO ABSURD THAT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION PATTY AGREED AMICABLY
IT'S POSITIVELY UNCANNY PRISCILLA DECLARED I SHALL GO TO THE REGISTRAR AND TELL HER THAT THIS KATE FERRIS IS NEITHER DOWN IN THE CATALOGUE NOR THE COLLEGE DIRECTORY AND FIND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES
PATTY SHOOK HER HEAD NOT JUST NOW I SHOULDN'T DARE SHE BELIEVES IN CORPORAL PUNISHMENT A FEW DAYS LATER PRISCILLA RECEIVED ANOTHER NOTE DIRECTED IN THE HAND SHE HAD COME TO DREAD SHE THREW IT INTO THE WASTE BASKET UNOPENED
I AM GOING TO INVITE KATE FERRIS SHE ANNOUNCED I INSIST UPON FINDING OUT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE DO SAID PATTY I SHOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MYSELF THE INVITATION WAS DESPATCHED AND ON THE NEXT DAY PRISCILLA RECEIVED A FORMAL ACCEPTANCE
PERHAPS IT IS HARRIS INSTEAD OF FERRIS PRISCILLA FACED HER OMINOUSLY YOU READ THE NAME YOURSELF IT WAS AS PLAIN AS PRINTING WE'RE ALL LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES PATTY MURMURED SOOTHINGLY DO YOU KNOW
THAT KATE FERRIS IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE IF SHE CHANGES HER MIND MANY MORE TIMES THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
I HAVE SO MANY FRESHMEN SHE APOLOGIZED I CANNOT ALL OF THEM WITH THEIR QUEER NAMES REMEMBER PRISCILLA INQUIRED ABOUT KATE FERRIS FROM THE FRESHMEN SHE KNEW
I BEGIN TO THINK SO MYSELF SAID PATTY THE NEXT MORNING'S MAIL BROUGHT A BUNCH OF VIOLETS AND AN APOLOGY FROM KATE FERRIS
WERE REENTERTAINING ONE OR TWO FRIENDS ON THE LETTUCE SANDWICHES AND CAKES THE OBLIGING GUESTS HAD FAILED TO CONSUME THE COMPANY AND THE CLOTHES HAVING PASSED IN REVIEW THE CONVERSATION FLAGGED A LITTLE AND GEORGIE SUDDENLY ASKED
BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES LATELY KATE FERRIS PRISCILLA EXHIBITED THE NOTE TO THE PRESIDENT AS A TANGIBLE PROOF THAT KATE FERRIS STILL EXISTED AND REINSCRIBED THE NAME IN THE ROLL BOOK
I LEFT MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON THE BOOKCASE KATE FERRIS AS PRISCILLA SCRATCHED THE NAME OUT OF THE ROLL BOOK AGAIN SHE REMARKED TO PATTY
BUT CURIOSITY PREVAILING SHE DREW IT OUT AGAIN AND READ IT DEAR MISS POND AS I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE COLLEGE ON ACCOUNT OF MY HEALTH I INCLOSE MY RESIGNATION TO THE GERMAN CLUB I THANK YOU VERY SINCERELY FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME THIS YEAR
SAID GEORGIE I BEGIN TO THINK IT'S ALL A HALLUCINATION AND THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY KATE FERRIS IT'S STRANGE OF COURSE BUT NOT ANY STRANGER THAN SOME OF THOSE CASES YOU READ ABOUT IN PSYCHOLOGY
PRISCILLA TOSSED THE NOTE TO PATTY WITH A GROAN AND GETTING OUT THE ROLL BOOK SHE TURNED TO THE F AND REENROLLED KATE FERRIS PATTY SYMPATHETICALLY WATCHED THE PROCESS OVER HER SHOULDER THE BOOK IS GETTING SO THIN IN THAT SPOT SHE LAUGHED
AND ADVISED ME TO STAY IN IT SO I SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL NOT PRESENT MY LETTER AT THE MEETING AFTER ALL AS I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER ADVICE KATE FERRIS
PRISCILLA DECLARED SHE'S MADE ME SO MUCH TROUBLE THAT I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE DID ASK FRAEULEIN SCHERIN
SAID GERTRUDE WHITE WITH TERROR DON'T LEAVE ME SO BUT TELL ME BLASI WHY DIETRICH HASN'T COME HOME WITH THE REST OF YOU BLASI HAD TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR DIETRICH'S MOTHER TO RUN AWAY FROM HER WHEN SHE PUT A DIRECT QUESTION TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE ESCAPED
HE HAS FIERY RED HAIR AND RED BEARD AND RED FACE HE HAS BUSINESS IN FOHRENSEE ONCE A WEEK AND LIVES THE REST OF THE TIME DOWN IN THE CITY AND HE ARRANGES EVERYTHING DOWN THERE AND THEN BRINGS THE ACCOUNT OF GAINS AND LOSSES UP TO THEM BUT IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE LOSS THAN GAIN
SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN THE MOON PEEPED OUT FROM BETWEEN THE FLYING CLOUDS AND SHONE PEACEFULLY DOWN UPON THE TREES AND THE NEAT FLOWER BEDS GERTRUDE SEATED HERSELF UPON A SMALL BENCH UNDER THE APPLE TREE AND GAZED ABOUT THE GARDEN
NO ONE EVER KNOWS HOW TO TAKE YOU GRUMBLED BLASI IT WOULDN'T HELP YOU TO TAKE ME IF YOU DID NOT TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT TOO SAID JUDITH BUT NEVER MIND I HAVE REALLY SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOU AND JUDITH MOTIONED TO HIM TO COME NEARER
THAT IN THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF LIFE LIES INWARD AND OUTWARD BLESSING SHE RECALLED THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS BORNE FROM THE HOUSE TO HIS BURIAL SHE HAD TAKEN THE CHILDREN BY THE HAND AND STUPEFIED WITH PAIN WAS ABOUT TO PUT THEM TO BED
DO YOU THINK SHE WILL HAVE HIM THE QUESTION SEEMED TO INTEREST JUDITH FOR SHE STOOD STOCK STILL WHO WHOM WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN VERONICA AND JOST DO YOU THINK SHE WILL TAKE HIM
FIRST I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING AND THEN YOU SHALL HAVE IT REPLIED JUDITH LOOK HERE BLASI MY SAINTED FATHER USED TO SAY IF YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKETS THEY WILL GET FULL BUT IF YOU KEEP THEM IN YOUR POCKETS WILL BE EMPTY NOW BOTH YOUR HANDS ARE IN YOUR POCKETS
HE HAD ANSWERED THAT HE MUST KEEP ON THERE FOR AWHILE TILL A CERTAIN UNDERTAKING WHICH HE HAD STARTED WITH JOST WAS FAIRLY UNDER WAY HE ASSURED HER THAT THIS AFFAIR WAS CERTAIN TO TURN OUT ALL RIGHT AND THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD BE SURPRISED AND SATISFIED AT THE RESULT
TWO MEN WERE KILLED SOME ONE STOLE THE CATTLE DEALER'S MONEY BAG IS DIETRICH KILLED SPEAK OUT BROKE IN GERTRUDE TREMBLING NO HE STRUCK ABOUT HIM BRAVELY TILL ONE OF THE FELLOWS GOT ENOUGH OF IT AND LAY DEAD ON THE GROUND
AND THEN HE MADE OFF WITH THIS
SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHE FOLDED HER HANDS IN PRAYER FOR HER HABIT WAS TO LAY ALL HER TROUBLES BEFORE GOD HER SUPPORTER AND COMFORTER AT THIS MOMENT SHE HEARD THROUGH THE STILLNESS LOUD SHOUTS AND CRIES FIRST AT A DISTANCE
BUT HE KNEW THE STRAIGHT ROAD AND WOULD NOT HIS STEPS TURN BACK TO IT AGAIN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN HER LITTLE DIETERLI LOVED GOOD AND ORDERLY CONDUCT IT COULD NOT BE THAT HE HAD LOST HIS LOVE FOR IT
I AM JUST WAITING THOUGH TILL I CAN TRIP HIM UP AND I'LL DO IT WITH A VENGEANCE TOO SO THAT HE WON'T FORGET IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG NOW THAT IS A GOOD IDEA SAID JUDITH YOU'D BETTER TELL HIM THEN THAT YOU DO IT TO PAY YOUR DEBTS
GERTRUDE MOUNTED WEARILY TO HER ROOM AS IF HER LAST DAY WAS COME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER BED AND WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT FILLED THE ROOM STILL SHE SAT THERE LISTENING IN TREMBLING ANXIETY
GERTRUDE HERSELF COULD SCARCELY UNDERSTAND POOR GERTRUDE ONE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM SHE HEARD HER SON LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH HASTY STEPS IT HAD BECOME A REGULAR THING NOW SHE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HERSELF
THREE FELLOWS SHOUTING AND CALLING PASSED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE SHE RECOGNIZED ONE OF THE VOICES JOST SHE CRIED FEEBLY JOST WHAT IS IT WHERE IS DIETRICH THERE WAS NO ANSWER JOST DID NOT OR WOULD NOT HEAR
AND IF THE LATTER SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS OR HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE GERTRUDE WOULD GIVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAD NO TIME TO STOP TO TALK GERTRUDE KNEW WHERE DIETRICH SPENT HIS EVENINGS SHE HAD EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT MORE THAN ONCE
HE HAD NEVER A CLEAN ONE FOR SUNDAY HE HAD NO ONE TO WASH FOR HIM HIS MOTHER WAS DEAD AND HIS FATHER HAD ENOUGH ELSE TO SPEND FOR WITHOUT THE WASHING FOR A GROWN UP SON BLASI'S MONEY WENT FOR OTHER THINGS THAN WASHING AND HE WAS NOT FOND OF DOING IT FOR HIMSELF
DIETRICH PUTS IN MORE MONEY EVERY TIME JOST HAS NOTHING TO PUT IN BUT PROMISES HE TELLS DIETRICH ALL THE TIME THAT PRESENTLY THE WINNINGS WILL BEGIN TO FLOW IN AND SAYS THAT AT FIRST A FELLOW MUST EXPECT TO LOSE SO AS TO WIN ALL THE MORE IN THE END
AS SHE HAD LISTENED THROUGH ALL THE LONG NIGHT IN VAIN DIETRICH HAD NOT COME HOME IN THE NIGHT
WHO HAD GREATLY ALTERED DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS SHE HAD NO LONGER THE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN NOTED FOR SHE HAD GROWN VERY QUIET AND SILENT SHE EVEN AVOIDED HER OLD AND WELL TRIED FRIEND JUDITH
BUT DIETERLI OBJECTED SAYING NO MOTHER NO IT IS NOT GOOD TO GO TO BED BEFORE YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS DID HER BOY EVER PRAY NOW OH DIETERLI MY SON YOU ARE WANDERING AWAY BUT YOU KNOW THE WAY HOME
AND I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE FRANCS TO A FELLOW LIKE YOU WHAT IS IT SHOW IT TO ME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A NICE WELL WASHED SHIRT FOR SUNDAY I WILL DO ONE UP FOR YOU IF YOU WILL TELL ME SOMETHING THAT WAS AN OFFER WORTH LISTENING TO SUNDAY WAS A WRETCHED DAY FOR BLASI FOR WHEN HE HAD TURNED HIS TWO SHIRTS AND WORN THEM BOTH ON BOTH SIDES
THEN NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL THEY GREW INTO A WILD TUMULT THEN MANY OF THE VOICES SEEMED TO SCATTER IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHILE SOME SOUNDED AS IF APPROACHING THE GARDEN A VAGUE FEAR SEIZED GERTRUDE
AND HE SAYS TOO THAT HE HAS NOTICED FOR SOME TIME THAT SHE HAS NO OBJECTION TO LETTING DIETRICH SEE THAT SHE CAN GET ALONG VERY WELL WITHOUT HIS HELP AND YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE'S ANGRY
AND SHE IS HOT WITH ANGER AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE HAS NOT TOLD HER ABOUT IT HIMSELF JOST SAYS THAT IF HE ONLY MENTIONS DIETRICH'S NAME BEFORE HER SHE LOOKS LIKE A WILD CAT IN A MOMENT
HE KNEW FROM SOME ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD IT THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL HE HAD TO DRAW LARGE SUMS SEVERAL TIMES FOR HIMSELF AND ALSO FOR JOST BUT HE WAS SANGUINE THAT IN A SHORT TIME IT WOULD ALL BE PAID BACK WITH INTEREST
COME A LITTLE NEARER TO THE WELL NO ONE KNOWS WHO MAY BE BEHIND THOSE TREES NOW LISTEN CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS GOING WRONG WITH DIETRICH HE NEVER WHISTLES NOW HE NEVER LAUGHS AND HIS MOTHER LOOKS SO SAD AND SHE RARELY SPEAKS EVEN TO ANSWER WHEN SPOKEN TO
THIS VERY RESERVE HOWEVER WAS RATHER DISTASTEFUL TO JUDITH AS REGARDED HERSELF BUT SHE LIKED IT TOWARDS OTHERS SHE HAD PLANNED IT ALL OUT THAT DIETRICH SHOULD MARRY VERONICA SOON AFTER THE CONFIRMATION THAT THEY SHOULD SET UP A PRETTY LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT AND BE HER BELOVED NEIGHBORS
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO DIETRICH YES AND KEEPS ON HAPPENING ALL SORTS OF THINGS TOO BUT JOST CAN TELL YOU MORE THAN I CAN THEY SIT TOGETHER IN THE REHBOCK HALF THE NIGHT AND MORE TOO LONG AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GONE THERE THEY SIT IN THE LITTLE BACK ROOM
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN HE WENT ON BUT I AM NOT SO VERY STUPID AS YOU THINK IT CERTAINLY MEANS SOMETHING WHEN SHE IS SO CHANGED JOST SAYS THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THAT DIETRICH HAS BEEN ABOUT
AND MUTTERED I WONDER IF SHE WANTS TO GET HIM TOO
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOMEBODY COMES OVER FROM FOHRENSEE AND EXPLAINS IT TO THEM HE DOES NOT BELONG THERE BUT I GUESS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM
YES SHE IS SHE IS SHE IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE IS ANGRY NOW JUDITH HAD LOOKED UPON HER NEIGHBOR'S BOY FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP AS IF HE BELONGED TO HER HE WAS HER PRIME
JUDITH BOUNCED VIOLENTLY INTO THE KITCHEN AND SET HER JUG DOWN WITH SUCH A BANG THAT THE WATER SPURTED UP INTO THE AIR AND NO ONE CAN GET A WORD OUT OF HER EITHER IT IS EXACTLY AS IF ALL THE OIL HAD BEEN BURNED OUT THIS LAST REMARK REFERRED TO GERTRUDE
AS BLASI SPOKE HE CAME SLOWLY NEARER TO JUDITH HE HAS BEEN SAYING SOME THINGS LATELY THAT MADE ME THINK SO
AND STUFFED HIS HANDS DEEPER INTO HIS POCKETS IT'S ALWAYS SO WITH ME SAID JUDITH WHEN I'VE LOST ANYTHING I CAN'T SEE IT OH HO YOU'RE MAKING A FOOL OF ME AGAIN THAT'S ALL THE THANKS I GET FOR TELLING YOU THAT YOU ARE LOSING SOMETHING
AH HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THIS GO ON BUT SHE TRIED HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SOON COME TO AN END AND HER SON WOULD RESUME HIS FORMER ORDERLY AND HAPPY MODE OF LIFE BUT THIS EVENING SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY IN HER BEDROOM
STOOD IN HIS DOORWAY IN THE CLEAR SUNSHINE OF THIS LOVELY SUMMER MORNING BOTH HANDS PLUNGED DEEP INTO HIS POCKETS AS WAS HIS WONT AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS IF TO SEE WHETHER EVERYTHING IN THE OUTER WORLD WAS THE SAME AS YESTERDAY
HE ADMIRED THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH THEIR HOST DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION THE FIVE YOUNG MEN HAD VARIOUS TASTES AND THEIR TONGUES HAD BEEN LOOSENED VILLONA WITH IMMENSE RESPECT BEGAN TO DISCOVER TO THE MILDLY SURPRISED ENGLISHMAN THE BEAUTIES OF THE ENGLISH MADRIGAL
RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
A TORRENT OF TALK FOLLOWED FARLEY WAS AN AMERICAN NO ONE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT THE TALK WAS ABOUT VILLONA AND RIVIERE WERE THE NOISIEST BUT ALL THE MEN WERE EXCITED THEY GOT UP ON A CAR SQUEEZING THEMSELVES TOGETHER AMID MUCH LAUGHTER
VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
A MAN BROUGHT IN A LIGHT SUPPER AND THE YOUNG MEN SAT DOWN TO IT FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY DRANK HOWEVER IT WAS BOHEMIAN THEY DRANK IRELAND ENGLAND FRANCE HUNGARY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JIMMY MADE A SPEECH A LONG SPEECH
THE TABLE WAS CLEARED VILLONA RETURNED QUIETLY TO HIS PIANO AND PLAYED VOLUNTARIES FOR THEM THE OTHER MEN PLAYED GAME AFTER GAME FLINGING THEMSELVES BOLDLY INTO THE ADVENTURE THEY DRANK THE HEALTH OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS AND OF THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS
THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
THEY WERE DEVILS OF FELLOWS BUT HE WISHED THEY WOULD STOP IT WAS GETTING LATE SOMEONE GAVE THE TOAST OF THE YACHT THE BELLE OF NEWPORT AND THEN SOMEONE PROPOSED ONE GREAT GAME FOR A FINISH THE PIANO HAD STOPPED VILLONA MUST HAVE GONE UP ON DECK
DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
THEY WERE WALKING OUT OF KINGSTOWN STATION THE TICKET COLLECTOR SALUTED JIMMY HE WAS AN OLD MAN FINE NIGHT SIR IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER NIGHT THE HARBOUR LAY LIKE A DARKENED MIRROR AT THEIR FEET
THE MEN ROSE TO THEIR FEET TO PLAY THE LAST TRICKS TALKING AND GESTICULATING ROUTH WON THE CABIN SHOOK WITH THE YOUNG MEN'S CHEERING AND THE CARDS WERE BUNDLED TOGETHER THEY BEGAN THEN TO GATHER IN WHAT THEY HAD WON FARLEY AND JIMMY WERE THE HEAVIEST LOSERS
BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
THEN AN IMPROMPTU SQUARE DANCE THE MEN DEVISING ORIGINAL FIGURES WHAT MERRIMENT JIMMY TOOK HIS PART WITH A WILL THIS WAS SEEING LIFE AT LEAST THEN FARLEY GOT OUT OF BREATH AND CRIED STOP
AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
THE ROOM GREW DOUBLY HOT AND SEGOUIN'S TASK GREW HARDER EACH MOMENT THERE WAS EVEN DANGER OF PERSONAL SPITE THE ALERT HOST AT AN OPPORTUNITY LIFTED HIS GLASS TO HUMANITY AND WHEN THE TOAST HAD BEEN DRUNK HE THREW OPEN A WINDOW SIGNIFICANTLY
WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
VILLONA SAYING HEAR HEAR WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS WHEN HE SAT DOWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD SPEECH FARLEY CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHAT JOVIAL FELLOWS WHAT GOOD COMPANY THEY WERE CARDS CARDS
JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
RAPID MOTION THROUGH SPACE ELATES ONE SO DOES NOTORIETY SO DOES THE POSSESSION OF MONEY THESE WERE THREE GOOD REASONS FOR JIMMY'S EXCITEMENT HE HAD BEEN SEEN BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS THAT DAY IN THE COMPANY OF THESE CONTINENTALS
NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
VILLONA SAID WITH CONVICTION IT IS DELIGHTFUL THERE WAS A YACHT PIANO IN THE CABIN VILLONA PLAYED A WALTZ FOR FARLEY AND RIVIERE FARLEY ACTING AS CAVALIER AND RIVIERE AS LADY
IT WAS A TERRIBLE GAME THEY STOPPED JUST BEFORE THE END OF IT TO DRINK FOR LUCK JIMMY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GAME LAY BETWEEN ROUTH AND SEGOUIN WHAT EXCITEMENT JIMMY WAS EXCITED TOO HE WOULD LOSE OF COURSE HOW MUCH HAD HE WRITTEN AWAY
THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND HE SAW THE HUNGARIAN STANDING IN A SHAFT OF GREY LIGHT
WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
SEGOUIN JIMMY DECIDED HAD A VERY REFINED TASTE THE PARTY WAS INCREASED BY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED ROUTH WHOM JIMMY HAD SEEN WITH SEGOUIN AT CAMBRIDGE THE YOUNG MEN SUPPED IN A SNUG ROOM LIT BY ELECTRIC CANDLE LAMPS
THEY PROCEEDED TOWARDS IT WITH LINKED ARMS SINGING CADET ROUSSEL IN CHORUS STAMPING THEIR FEET AT EVERY HO HO HOHE VRAIMENT THEY GOT INTO A ROWBOAT AT THE SLIP AND MADE OUT FOR THE AMERICAN'S YACHT THERE WAS TO BE SUPPER MUSIC CARDS
THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
IN A HAZE OF SUMMER EVENING IN JIMMY'S HOUSE THIS DINNER HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AN OCCASION A CERTAIN PRIDE MINGLED WITH HIS PARENTS TREPIDATION A CERTAIN EAGERNESS ALSO TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR THE NAMES OF GREAT FOREIGN CITIES HAVE AT LEAST THIS VIRTUE
THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
JIMMY FELT OBSCURELY THE LACK OF AN AUDIENCE THE WIT WAS FLASHING PLAY RAN VERY HIGH AND PAPER BEGAN TO PASS JIMMY DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHO WAS WINNING BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS LOSING BUT IT WAS HIS OWN FAULT FOR HE FREQUENTLY MISTOOK HIS CARDS
JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
AT THE CORNER OF GRAFTON STREET A SHORT FAT MAN WAS PUTTING TWO HANDSOME LADIES ON A CAR IN CHARGE OF ANOTHER FAT MAN THE CAR DROVE OFF AND THE SHORT FAT MAN CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PARTY ANDRE IT'S FARLEY
WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT
NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST ISN'T THAT SO
OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
I DON'T KNOW ANY MAN IN CONGRESS I'D SOONER GO TO FOR HELP IN ANY CHRISTIAN WORK WHAT DID HE SAY OH HE BEAT AROUND A LITTLE HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HELP THE NEGRO HIS HEART WENT OUT TO THE NEGRO AND ALL THAT PLENTY OF THEM SAY THAT BUT HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE TENNESSEE LAND BILL
UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
AH COME IN SIT DOWN AND THE SENATOR CLOSED THE BOOK AND LAID IT DOWN I WANTED TO SEE YOU
WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD
IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
I HOPE SO HIS NAME WILL GIVE TONE AND STRENGTH TO IT I KNEW YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT IT WAS JUST AND PURE IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS CORDIAL SUPPORT I THINK I CONVINCED HIM YES I AM PERFECTLY SURE HE WILL VOTE RIGHT NOW
IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
HE LIKED TO BE CALLED UNCLE BY THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN DID YOU SEE HOPPERSON LAST NIGHT AFTER THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER MEETING YES HE CAME HE'S A KIND OF EH HE IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS LAURA HE'S A FINE MAN A VERY FINE MAN
THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
MY DAUGHTER SAID THE SENATOR WITH A GRAVE LOOK I TRUST THERE WAS NOTHING FREE IN HIS MANNER FREE REPEATED LAURA WITH INDIGNATION IN HER FACE WITH ME THERE THERE CHILD I MEANT NOTHING BALLOON TALKS A LITTLE FREELY SOMETIMES WITH MEN
WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM
ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
OH NO I TOLD HIM YOU WERE DAFT ABOUT THE NEGRO AND THE PHILANTHROPY PART OF IT AS YOU ARE DAFT IS A LITTLE STRONG LAURA BUT YOU KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T TOUCH THIS BILL
WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM A GREAT DEAL ON CONFERENCE COMMITTEES HE WANTS REASONS GOOD ONES DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM HE WAS IN ERROR ABOUT THE BILL I DID I WENT OVER THE WHOLE THING I HAD TO TELL HIM SOME OF THE SIDE ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF THE YOU DIDN'T MENTION ME
AND THE SENATOR BEAMED WITH HIS OWN CONGRESSIONAL WIT IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE THINGS ARE WORKING VERY WELL WE HAVE MADE EVER SO MUCH PROGRESS IN A WEEK I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER COULD RUN THIS GOVERNMENT BEAUTIFULLY UNCLE THE SENATOR BEAMED AGAIN
YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
BUT HE HAS CHARITABLE IMPULSES IF WE SECURE HIM WE SHALL HAVE A FAVORABLE REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE
THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
I EXPECT TO SEE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TO DAY MISTER BUCKSTONE
AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE COLORED RACE MUCH AS I AM INTERESTED IN THE HEIRS OF THIS PROPERTY AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM SUCCEED LAURA LOOKED A LITTLE INCREDULOUS AND THE SENATOR PROCEEDED DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I DON'T DENY THAT IT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF ALL OF US THAT THIS BILL SHOULD GO THROUGH AND IT WILL
IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WASN'T IN IT HE SHOULD SUSPECT THERE WAS A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT HE SAID THAT DID HE YES AND HE SAID HE FELT HE COULDN'T VOTE FOR IT HE WAS SHY NOT SHY CHILD CAUTIOUS HE'S A VERY CAUTIOUS MAN
RUNNING HIS EYE DOWN THE LIST THAT'S ENCOURAGING WHAT IS THE C BEFORE SOME OF THE NAMES AND THE B B THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MARKS THAT C STANDS FOR CONVINCED WITH ARGUMENT
AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
IF IT WAS NOT TO AID IN THE SALVATION OF HIS FELLOW MEN THE SENATOR SPOKE WITH FEELING AND THEN ADDED I HOPE YOU SHOWED HOPPERSON THAT OUR MOTIVES WERE PURE YES AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE A NEW LIGHT ON THE MEASURE I THINK WILL VOTE FOR IT
BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD SAID THE SENATOR SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'LL FIND SOME CHANGES IN THAT I GUESS HANDING THE SENATOR A PRINTED LIST OF NAMES THOSE CHECKED OFF ARE ALL RIGHT AH M M
SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME
THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN
AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
BUT YOU SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING
ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
AND IT APPEARED AS IF SOME CHEERFUL EVENTFUL UPWARD TENDING CAREER WERE EVEN THEN OPENING TO ME ON THAT SELFSAME MILD STILL APRIL NIGHT
YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHILLING HAD NOT A SECOND LARGE PAIR OF FOLDING DOORS STANDING WIDE OPEN AND DISCLOSING ANOTHER AND SMALLER SALON MORE SNUGLY FURNISHED OFFERED SOME RELIEF TO THE EYE
WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE
THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF
WAS IT SAGACITY SENSE YES I THOUGHT SO BUT I COULD SCARCELY AS YET BE SURE I DISCOVERED HOWEVER
WHO MIGHT INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT IN CURLS
WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID AH
PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
FOR I AM NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET
AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE DUSK I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL
WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
WHEN YOU GIT THROUGH FISHIN COME UP TO THE HOUSE RIGHT UP THE CREEK THAR AN I'LL GIVE YE A DRAM THANK YOU SAID THE FISHERMAN STIFFLY AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AT THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES HE LOOKED BACK THE STRANGER WAS STILL FISHING
AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD
BUT CALMLY SHE HIT THE HORSE AGAIN AND THE OLD MAN CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER YOU COME ON DOWN TO THE MILL AN I'LL SHOW YE WHAR YOU CAN KETCH A MESS ALL RIGHT SHOUTED HALE HOLDING BACK HIS LAUGHTER AND ON THEY WENT
HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
AND IT WAS A QUICK AND CUNNING RUSE HE OWED HER SOMETHING FOR THAT WHY DID SHE TRY TO PROTECT HIM WONDERFUL EYES TOO THE LITTLE THING HAD DEEP AND DARK AND HOW THE FLAME DID DART FROM THEM WHEN SHE GOT ANGRY HE SMILED REMEMBERING
BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THESE MOUNTAINS WANT TO KNOW MY NAME YOU HEERD ME YES THE FISHERMAN TURNED AGAIN AND SAW THE GIANT'S RUGGED FACE STERN AND PALE WITH OPEN ANGER NOW
HE HAD NOT MOVED HAND OR FOOT AND HE SAID NOTHING BUT HIS MOUTH WAS SET HARD AND HIS BEWILDERED BLUE EYES HAD A GLINT IN THEM THAT THE MOUNTAINEER DID NOT AT THE MOMENT SEE HE WAS LEANING WITH ONE ARM ON THE MUZZLE OF HIS WINCHESTER HIS FACE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME SUAVE AND SHREWD AND NOW HE LAUGHED AGAIN
THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED TO THE FISHERMAN WHO HAD JUST PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW AND TOSSED IT INTO THE RIVER PURTY WELL THANK YOU HE SAID SHORTLY HOW ARE YOU FINE WAS THE NONCHALANT ANSWER
WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
AND THE FISHERMAN WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD ARIGHT JUNE THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A SHRILL ANSWERING CRY BUT SHE DID NOT MOVE THAR NOW SHE SAID WHO'S THAT YOUR MAMMY NO TAIN'T
HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL
AND THE OLD MAN WENT ON WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD HE'LL COME HE SAID TO HIMSELF OH HE'LL COME THAT VERY POINT HALE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF AS HE UNAVAILINGLY CAST HIS MINNOW INTO THE SWIFT WATER AND SLOWLY WOUND IT IN AGAIN
WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
I RECKON YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I BE I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE AGAIN THE MOUNTAINEER STARED NO USE GITTIN MAD YOUNG FELLER HE SAID COOLLY I MISTAKEN YE FER SOMEBODY ELSE AN I AXE YER PARDON
AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
HIT'S MY STEP MAMMY I'M A GOIN TO KETCH HELL NOW HER INNOCENT EYES TURNED SULLEN AND HER BABY MOUTH TIGHTENED GOOD LORD SAID THE FISHERMAN STARTLED AND THEN HE STOPPED THE WORDS WERE AS INNOCENT ON HER LIPS AS A BENEDICTION
THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
I MIGHT HAVE A GUN MYSELF SOMETIMES DID YOU THINK YOU COULD SCARE ME THE MOUNTAINEER STARED IN GENUINE SURPRISE TWUSN'T NO JOKE HE SAID SHORTLY
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED
HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
NO NOT IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHY THE FISHERMAN LOOKED AROUND AND WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY THE FIERCE GAZE OF HIS QUESTIONER STOP THAT PLEASE HE SAID WITH A HUMOUROUS SMILE YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS
HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
HAVE YOU GOT A FATHER LIKE A FLASH HER WHOLE FACE CHANGED
IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
HOW DID THAT OLD MAN KNOW HIS NAME AND WOULD THE OLD SAVAGE REALLY HAVE HURT HIM HAD HE NOT FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A WONDER EVIDENTLY SHE HAD MUFFLED HIS LAST NAME ON PURPOSE NOT KNOWING IT HERSELF
THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING
DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
SO I GAVE OUT ONE TWO THREE AND WHILE I WENT ON COUNTING HEARD HIM REPEATING TO HIMSELF THOUGH HIS WORDS SEEMED THIN AND FAR OFF WE MUST HAVE TAKEN TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE
PUTTING MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SO HE BORE ME PICKABACK I SHUT MY EYES FIRM AGAIN AND THUS WE MOVED ALONG ANOTHER SPELL MOUNTING STILL AND FEELING THE WIND STILL FRESHENING
AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF
THERE IS NO TIME TO PLAY THE WOMAN ANOTHER MINUTE OF THIS AND WE ARE LOST PLUCK UP THY COURAGE KEEP THY EYES TO THE CLIFF AND FORWARD YET I COULD NOT BUT ANSWERED I CANNOT I CANNOT
AND IN FIVE MORE THEY WILL BE ON THE UNDER CLIFF AND IF WE EVER REACH THE TOP WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAVE LEFT A GUARD NO NO THEY WILL NOT LEAVE A GUARD FOR NOT A MAN KNOWS OF THE ZIGZAG AND IF THEY KNEW
FOR THERE IS NO ROOM TO DANCE HORNPIPES HERE AND HOLD THY EYES FIXED ON THE CHALK WALL LOOKING NEITHER DOWN NOR SEAWARD TWAS WELL HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO AND WELL I DID IT
WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING
NOW I WAS SO BESOTTED WITH FRIGHT THAT I WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH FEARING TO FALL OVER IF I OPENED MY EYES AND ELZEVIR FOR ALL HE WAS SO STRONG COULD NOT PULL A HELPLESS LUMP BACKWARDS UP THAT PATH
BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE
AND LEAVE ME WHERE I WAS FOR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON A BOY TUSH HE CRIED IT IS THY HEART THAT FAILS THEE AND TIS TOO LATE NOW TO CHANGE COUNSEL
AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH
THERE IS YET ANOTHER WAY THAT WE MAY TRY AND IF THOU HADST BUT TWO WHOLE LEGS I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT BUT NOW TIS LITTLE SHORT OF MADNESS AND YET IF THOU FEAR'ST NOT I WILL STILL TRY IT
BUT OPEN NOT THY EYES TILL I HAVE SET THEE DOWN AND BID THEE I DID AS BIDDEN AND HE LOWERED ME GENTLY SETTING ME ON ALL FOURS UPON THE PATH AND SPEAKING AGAIN
THE PATH IS TOO NARROW HERE FOR ME TO CARRY THEE AND THOU MUST CREEP ROUND THIS CORNER ON THY HANDS AND KNEES BUT HAVE A CARE TO KEEP THY OUTER HAND NEAR TO THE INNER AND THE BALANCE OF THY BODY TO THE CLIFF
AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW
FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
SO SHUT THY EYES AND KEEP THEM TIGHT UNTIL I BID THEE OPEN THEM WITH THAT HE CAUGHT ME UP AGAIN AND I SHUT MY EYES FIRM REBUKING MYSELF FOR MY FAINT HEARTEDNESS AND NOT TELLING HIM HOW MUCH MY FOOT HURT ME
I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES
I SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF DOWN IN SHEER DESPAIR TO GET QUIT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS KEEP THINE EYES SHUT JOHN HE SAID AND COUNT UP NUMBERS LOUD TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THOU ART NOT TURNING FAINT
THINKING THAT WE WERE HIDING BY THE SEA FIVE MINUTES LATER ELZEVIR STEPPED ON TO THE CLIFF TOP WITH ME UPON HIS BACK WE HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS THROW HE SAID AND ARE SAFE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THOUGH I THOUGHT THY GIDDY HEAD HAD RUINED US
IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED
LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG
I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT
IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE ENOUGH BUT CAME AS WELCOME AS A PATCH OF BLUE THROUGH LOWERING SKIES YES I SAID DEAR MASTER ELZEVIR LET US GET TO IT QUICKLY AND IF WE FALL
I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID
SO HE GAVE IT UP LEAVING GO HOLD ON ME WITH A GROAN AND AT THAT MOMENT THERE ROSE FROM THE UNDER CLIFF BELOW A SOUND OF VOICES AND SHOUTING ZOUNDS THEY ARE DOWN ALREADY CRIED ELZEVIR AND HAVE FOUND MASKEW'S BODY
AND NOT A MAN IN ALL THE WORLD TO DO IT WITH A FULL GROWN LAD IN HIS ARMS YET ELZEVIR MADE NO BONES OF IT NOR SPOKE A SINGLE WORD ONLY HE WENT VERY SLOW AND I FELT HIM SCUFFLE WITH HIS FOOT
TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG
FOR THE ZIGZAG STARTED OFF AS A FAIR ENOUGH CHALK PATH BUT IN A FEW PACES NARROWED DOWN TILL IT WAS BUT A WHITER THREAD AGAINST THE GREY WHITE CLIFF FACE
BOTH WERE ON ALL FOURS NOW ELZEVIR FIRST AND I FOLLOWING BUT AS I CREPT ALONG I RELAXED CARE FOR A MOMENT AND MY EYES WANDERED FROM THE CLIFF SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AND FAR BELOW
I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE HAD CLIMBED IT AND THAT WAS LANDER JORDAN WHEN THE EXCISE WAS ON HIS HEELS HALF A CENTURY BACK BUT HE THAT TRIES IT STAKES ALL ON HEAD AND FOOT AND A WOUNDED BIRD LIKE THEE MAY NOT DARE THAT FLIGHT
AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP
BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT
WHERE THE UNDER CLIFF DIES BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHALK FACE AND CLIMBS BY SLANTS AND ELBOW TURNS UP TO THE TOP THE SHEPHERDS CALL IT THE ZIGZAG AND EVEN SHEEP LOSE THEIR FOOTING ON IT AND OF MEN
YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY
JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR
AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT
THUS HE WENT ON FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED WITHOUT END AND YET WAS REALLY BUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND BY DEGREES I FELT THE WIND THAT WE COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE AT ALL ON THE UNDER CLIFF BLOW FRESHER AND COLD ON THE CLIFF SIDE
IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT
FORGETTING WHAT I SUFFERED CRIED OUT QUICKEN THY PACE LAD IF THOU CANST THE TIME IS SHORT NOW SO FRAIL IS MAN'S TEMPER THAT THOUGH HE WAS DOING MORE THAN ANY EVER DID TO SAVE ANOTHER'S LIFE AND WAS ALL I HAD TO TRUST TO IN THE WORLD YET
MOVE THOU MUST AND TIS BETTER TO RISK FALLING NOW THAN FALL FOR CERTAIN WITH ANOTHER BULLET IN THEE LATER ON AND WITH THAT HE SHIFTED HIS HAND FROM MY BACK AND FIXED IT IN MY COAT COLLAR MOVING BACKWARDS HIMSELF AND SETTING TO DRAG ME AFTER HIM
WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO
THUS I LAY WITH MY FACE TO THE CLIFF AND ELZEVIR PUSHING FIRMLY IN MY BACK AND THE THING THAT FRIGHTENED ME MOST WAS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE HAND TO TAKE HOLD OF FOR HAD THERE BEEN A PIECE OF STRING OR EVEN A THREAD OF COTTON
AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN
WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART
IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
AND BEFORE THEY COME TO WHERE WE LIE WE CAN HOLD THE TROOP AT BAY AND SELL OUR LIVES SO DEAR THEY WILL NOT CARE TO BUY THEM WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STEPS BACK FIRST AS ONE GOES DOWN A HATCHWAY
THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND
THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN
WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL
THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH
THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL
AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL
FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS
ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE
BUT WHEN ELZEVIR SAT DOWN THE BOY GAVE A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND AND SEEING NO ONE WATCHING ANY MORE
WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND
I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY
AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER
AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH
AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW
SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
THOUGH IT LEFT SOMETIMES A LITTLE PATCH OF BROKEN RUBBLE PEERING OUT AT THE TOP OF A MOUND THERE WERE MANY TUMBLE DOWN WALLS AND LOW GABLES LEFT OF THE COTTAGES OF THE OLD QUARRYMEN GRASS COVERED RIDGES MARKED OUT THE LITTLE GARDEN FOLDS
AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN
THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH
WITH THAT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN WHERE THERE WAS A NARROW SHADOW CLOSE AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL AND IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM HIS HEAVY BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE WIND HAD FRESHENED MUCH AND WAS BLOWING STRONG FROM THE WEST
THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH
BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER
ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER
AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT
NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL
THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY
AND MANY OTHERS THEY HAD ON COARSE STRIPED DRESSES AND BIG GROTESQUE HEAVY SHOES I BURST INTO TEARS AS THEY LED ME AWAY
WHEN MISSUS LEWIS DOUBLED OVER AND HANDLED LIKE A SACK OF SOMETHING
SEIZE THESE WOMEN TAKE THEM OFF THAT ONE THAT ONE TAKE HER OFF THE GUARDS RUSHED FORWARD AND AN ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE SCENE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION ENSUED I SAW ONE OF THE GUARDS SEIZE HER LUCY BURNS
WHEN MISS LUCY BURNS AND MISSUS LAWRENCE LEWIS WERE SO WEAK THAT MISTER WHITTAKER FEARED THEIR DEATH THEY WERE FORCIBLY FED AND TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO THE JAIL IN WASHINGTON OF THE EXPERIENCE MISSUS LEWIS WROTE I WAS SEIZED
AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
AND FORCE THE HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP THIS GROUP AWAY FROM ALICE PAUL AND HER COMPANIONS AS THEY COUNTED ON HANDLING THE REBELLION MORE EASILY IN TWO GROUPS THAN ONE MEANWHILE THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS IN THE WORKHOUSE GREW STEADILY WORSE
ASKED FOR WHITTAKER WHO CAME HE SEIZED JULIA EMORY BY THE BACK OF HER NECK AND THREW HER INTO THE ROOM VERY BRUTALLY SHE IS A LITTLE GIRL I ASKED FOR COUNSEL TO LEARN THE STATUS OF THE CASE I WAS TOLD TO SHUT UP AND WAS AGAIN THREATENED WITH A STRAITJACKET AND A BUCKLE GAG
AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO LIE DOWN FEELING SO ILL I COULD NOT SLEEP HAVING A SENSE OF CONSTANT DANGER I WAS ALMOST PARALYZED AND IN WRETCHED PHYSICAL CONDITION
IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
AS THEY RAN ME PAST SHE WAS LYING THERE WITH HER ARMS OUT AND WE HEARD ONE OF THE MEN YELL THE SUFFRAGER MY MOTHER AIN'T NO SUFFRAGER I'LL PUT YOU THROUGH AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE
AND THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT THE MATRON AND GUARDS WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ACT TOWARDS US AS THEY HAD ACTED UNLESS THEY RELIED UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FROM THE TIME WE REACHED THE WORKHOUSE TO TERRORIZE US AND MY FEAR
FORTY ONE WOMEN REPRESENTING SIXTEEN STATES IN THE UNION MIGHT CREATE A CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DISLOCATION BUT THESE SAME FORTY ONE WOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ITS CHOICE IT COULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PEACEFUL AGITATION
THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS
I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
AS SHE SAID IN COURT WE TOOK THIS ACTION WITH GREAT CONSECRATION OF SPIRIT WITH WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL LIBERTY
NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH DEMANDED TO SEE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER REQUEST REFUSED MISSUS HERNDON THE MATRON SAID WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UP ALL NIGHT ONE OF THE MEN GUARDS SAID HE WOULD PUT US IN SARDINE BOX AND PUT MUSTARD ON US
AND ONE CHAIR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE BEING FORCED INTO THE CELLS THE GUARDS KEPT UP AN UPROAR SHOUTING BANGING THE IRON DOORS CLANGING BARS MAKING A TERRIFYING NOISE
A NEGRO TRUSTY WAS THERE I FELL BACK AGAIN INTO THE SAME STUPOR THE NEXT DAY THEY BROUGHT ME SOME TOAST AND A PLATE OF FOOD THE FIRST I HAD BEEN OFFERED IN OVER THIRTY SIX HOURS
BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
SMUGGLED OUT OF THE WORKHOUSE MISS BURNS IS SO GIFTED A WRITER THAT I FEEL APOLOGETIC FOR USING THESE SCRAPS IN THEIR RAW FORM BUT I KNOW SHE WILL FORGIVE ME WEDNESDAY
SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
WITH MISS BURNS AND MISSUS LEWIS WHO WERE REGARDED AS LEADERS IN THE HUNGER STRIKE PROTEST REMOVED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL MISTER WHITTAKER AND HIS STAFF AT OCCOQUAN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO BREAK DOWN THE MORALE OF THE HUNGER STRIKERS
THIS WEEK OF BRUTALITY WHICH RIVALED OLD RUSSIA IF IT DID NOT OUTSTRIP IT WAS ALMOST THE BLACKEST PAGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S CRUEL FIGHT AGAINST WOMEN HERE ARE SOME OF THE SCRAPS OF MISS BURN'S DAY BY DAY LOG
THE DOOR WAS BARRED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
GAG YOU AND PUT YOU IN A STRAITJACKET I WISH TO STATE AGAIN THAT THE CELLS INTO WHICH WE WERE PUT WERE SITUATED IN THE MEN'S PRISON
I SLEPT WITH DOROTHY DAY IN A SINGLE BED I WAS HANDCUFFED ALL NIGHT AND MANACLED TO THE BARS PART OF THE TIME FOR ASKING THE OTHERS HOW THEY WERE AND WAS THREATENED WITH A STRAITJACKET AND A BUCKLE GAG THURSDAY NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH
I TURNED AND TWISTED MY HEAD ALL I COULD BUT HE MANAGED TO PUSH IT UP IT HURTS NOSE AND THROAT VERY MUCH AND MAKES NOSE BLEED FREELY TUBE DRAWN OUT COVERED WITH BLOOD OPERATION LEAVES ONE VERY SICK
SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER CAME AT NINE P M HE REFUSED TO HEAR OUR DEMAND FOR POLITICAL RIGHTS SEIZED BY GUARDS FROM BEHIND FLUNG OFF MY FEET AND SHOT OUT OF THE ROOM
IT HAD TO STOP PICKETING WHETHER THIS WAS DONE LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY CLUMSILY OR DEXTEROUSLY WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE PICKETING MUST BE STOPPED
LATER I WAS TAKEN TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES REFUSED AND RESISTED STRENUOUSLY
I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
OR DO PRISON LABOR ANY WORDS OF MINE WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO TELL THE STORY OF THE PRISONERS RECEPTION AT THE OCCOQUAN WORKHOUSE THE FOLLOWING IS THE STATEMENT OF MISSUS NOLAN DICTATED UPON HER RELEASE IN THE PRESENCE OF MISTER DUDLEY FIELD MALONE
COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO OBTAIN A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS A HURRIED JOURNEY BY COUNSEL TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE WADDILL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA BROUGHT THE WRIT
AND ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS UNTIL MORNING
NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAY FOLLOWING THEIR COMMITMENT TO OCCOQUAN MISTER O'BRIEN OF COUNSEL WAS DIRECTED TO SEE THE WOMEN TO ASCERTAIN THEIR CONDITION
THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
THE NEXT DAY MISTER O'BRIEN AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO SEE HIS CLIENTS AS DID ALSO THE MOTHER OF MISS MATILDA YOUNG THE YOUNGEST PRISONER IN MISTER WHITTAKER'S CARE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MISSUS LEWIS AND I WERE ASKED TO GO TO THE OPERATING ROOM WENT THERE AND FOUND OUR CLOTHES TOLD WE WERE TO GO TO WASHINGTON NO REASON AS USUAL WHEN WE WERE DRESSED DOCTOR GANNON APPEARED
MISSUS ALICE M COSU NEW ORLEANS MARYLAND MISS MARY BARTLETT DIXON EASTON MISS JULIA EMORY BALTIMORE FLORIDA MISSUS MARY I NOLAN JACKSONVILLE
MISSUS COSU WOULD NOT LET ME LIE ON THE FLOOR SHE PUT ME ON THE COUCH AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE TWO PADS THEY THREW IN
TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING DURING ALL OF THIS TIME SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER WAS DIRECTING THE WHOLE ATTACK ALL OF US WERE THROWN INTO DIFFERENT CELLS IN THE MEN'S PRISON I BEING PUT IN ONE WITH FOUR OTHER WOMEN THE CELL CONTAINING A NARROW BED
YOU'RE MISSUS MARY NOLAN SAID WHITTAKER
AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
THE TERRIBLE ANXIETY AT HEADQUARTERS WAS NOT RELIEVED THE THIRD DAY BY A REPORT BROUGHT FROM THE WORKHOUSE BY ONE OF THE MARINES STATIONED AT QUANTICO STATION VIRGINIA WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE WORKHOUSE ON THE NIGHT THE WOMEN ARRIVED
WAS STRETCHED ON BED TWO DOCTORS MATRON FOUR COLORED PRISONERS PRESENT WHITTAKER IN HALL I WAS HELD DOWN BY FIVE PEOPLE AT LEGS ARMS AND HEAD I REFUSED TO OPEN MOUTH GANNON PUSHED TUBE UP LEFT NOSTRIL
AT THIS SUGGESTION TINY MISSUS NOLAN PULLED HERSELF UP ON HER TOES AND SAID WITH GREAT DIGNITY
MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN WAS AMONG THE WOMEN WHO ENDURED THE NIGHT OF TERROR MISSUS BRANNAN IS THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES A DANA FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK SUN AND THAT GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT OF LIBERTY WHO WAS A TRUSTED ASSOCIATE AND COUNSELOR
WHO WENT ASKING TO SEE HER MOTHER MISS MOREY WAS HELD UNDER ARMED GUARD HALF A MILE FROM THE PRISON ADMISSION WAS DENIED TO ALL OF THEM
I THINK I MADE HIM THINK HE MOTIONED TO THE GUARD GET A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE HER HE SAID IN THE HOSPITAL COTTAGE
THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
ALL OF US WERE SEIZED BY MEN GUARDS AND DRAGGED TO CELLS IN MEN'S PART DOROTHY DAY WAS ROUGHLY USED BACK TWISTED MISSUS MARY A NOLAN SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD PICKET FROM JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA FLUNG INTO CELL
WAS THE UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTORS
I JUST LOOKED AT THE FOOD AND MOTIONED IT AWAY IT MADE ME SICK I WAS RELEASED ON THE SIXTH DAY AND PASSED THE DISPENSARY AS I CAME OUT
WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
SAID SHE MUST SPEAK TO WHITTAKER THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PLACE
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WERE ALARMED AS NOT A LINE OF NEWS HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO PENETRATE TO THE WORLD MISTER O'BRIEN WAS DENIED ADMISSION AND FORCED TO COME BACK TO WASHINGTON WITHOUT ANY REPORT WHATSOEVER
HE BROUGHT NEWS THAT UNKNOWN TORTURES WERE GOING ON MISTER O'BRIEN IMMEDIATELY FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH BY A COURT ORDER
MISSUS HERNDON CALLED MY NAME BUT I DID NOT ANSWER
LEST THE EXTREME OF OUTRAGE WOULD BE WORKED UPON THE YOUNG GIRLS OF OUR PARTY BECAME INTENSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE TERROR OF THAT NIGHT
THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK MORE MELODRAMATIC THAN THE MOST STIRRING MOVING PICTURE FILM ALTHOUGH THE WRIT HAD BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE GREATEST SECRECY
MISSUS HERNDON WAS STANDING BEHIND A DESK WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS OFFICE AND THERE WERE FIVE OR SIX MEN ALSO IN THE ROOM
EACH ONE WAS CALLED TO THE MAT AND INTERROGATED WILL YOU WORK WILL YOU PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WILL YOU EAT WILL YOU STOP PICKETING WILL YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING YOUR FINE AND PROMISE NEVER TO PICKET AGAIN
I HAVE A NEPHEW FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY IN FRANCE
I AND ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WERE LYING DOWN ON THE NARROW BED ON WHICH WERE A BLANKET AND ONE PILLOW THE DOOR OF THE CELL WAS OPENED AND A MATTRESS AND A BLANKET BEING THROWN IN THE DOOR WAS VIOLENTLY BANGED TO
WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
I SAW MISS LINCOLN LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF HAVING JUST BEEN THROWN DOWN BY THE TWO GUARDS WHO WERE STANDING OVER HER IN A MENACING ATTITUDE SEEING THE GENERAL DISTURBANCE
I SAW THE GUARDS SEIZING THE DIFFERENT WOMEN OF THE PARTY WITH THE UTMOST VIOLENCE THE FURNITURE BEING OVERTURNED AND THE ROOM A SCENE OF THE UTMOST DISTURBANCE
MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
I SAID NO DON'T YOU KNOW NOW THAT I AM MISTER WHITTAKER THE SUPERINTENDENT HE ASKED IS THERE ANY AGE LIMIT TO YOUR WORKHOUSE I SAID WOULD A WOMAN OF SEVENTY THREE OR A CHILD OF TWO BE SENT HERE
YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A SPECIAL ORDER TO VISIT HER DAUGHTER FAILING TO SECURE THIS SHE WENT DAILY TO MISTER TUMULTY'S OFFICE ASKING IF HE HIMSELF WOULD NOT INTERCEDE FOR HER
IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
LEFT NOSTRIL THROAT AND MUSCLES OF NECK VERY SORE ALL NIGHT AFTER THIS I WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE MISSUS LEWIS AND I PLACED IN SAME ROOM SLEPT HARDLY AT ALL THIS MORNING DOCTOR LADD APPEARED WITH HIS TUBE
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BREATHE FROM AND EVERYTHING TURNED BLACK WHEN THE FLUID BEGAN POURING IN I WAS MOANING AND MAKING THE MOST AWFUL SOUNDS QUITE AGAINST MY WILL FOR I DID NOT WISH TO DISTURB MY FRIENDS IN THE NEXT ROOM FINALLY
FOR THE LIBERTY OF AMERICAN WOMEN
I HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN RUSSIA UNDERGO EXTREME SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEALS BUT UNLESS I HAD SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF I DID NOT JOIN THESE BRAVE WOMEN IN THEIR FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA I SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE HONOR TO DIE IN PRISON
A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
AND LAID ON MY BACK WHERE FIVE PEOPLE HELD ME A YOUNG COLORED WOMAN LEAPING UPON MY KNEES WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK UNDER THE WEIGHT DOCTOR GANNON THEN FORCED THE TUBE THROUGH MY LIPS AND DOWN MY THROAT I GASPING AND SUFFOCATING WITH THE AGONY OF IT
ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM
BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
I HAD BEEN FORCIBLY EXAMINED BY DOCTOR GANNON I PROTESTING THAT I WISHED A WOMAN PHYSICIAN OF THIS EXPERIENCE MISS BURNS WROTE ON TINY SCRAPS OF PAPER WEDNESDAY
BUT WILL TAKE THE MATTER OF SENTENCE UNDER ADVISEMENT AND SO THE GUILTY PICKETS WERE SUMMARILY RELEASED THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT RELISH THE INCARCERATION OF FORTY ONE WOMEN FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN LIMITED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS
SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
THE MEN WHO HAD SHORTLY BEFORE ATTACKED US
A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
MISSUS LEWIS AND I SAID WE WOULD NOT BE FORCIBLY FED SAID HE WOULD CALL IN MEN GUARDS AND FORCE US TO SUBMIT WENT AWAY AND WE WERE NOT FED AT ALL THIS MORNING WE HEAR THEM OUTSIDE NOW CRACKING EGGS
HOW BAFFLED HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER WAS DEFINITE AND FINAL THEIR RESISTANCE WAS SUPERB ONE OF THE FEW WARNING INCIDENTS DURING THE GRAY DAYS OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
AND LAY DOWN COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THE BLANKET I LOOKED ACROSS THE CORRIDOR AND SAW MISS LINCOLN AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS ALL RIGHT BEING ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN HURT BY THE TREATMENT IN THE OFFICE BUILDING INSTANTLY SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER RUSHED FORWARD SHOUTING AT ME
THE WOMEN SUSPECTED HIS SOLICITUDE AND REFUSED TO MAKE ANY PROMISE WHATSOEVER WITHOUT FIRST BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE THE WRIT ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO BUT FOR US IT DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TASK
MISS BURNS RECEIVED SIX MONTHS IN PRONOUNCING THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE UPON MISSUS NOLAN THE JUDGE SAID THAT HE DID SO ON ACCOUNT OF HER AGE HE URGED HER HOWEVER TO PAY HER FINE HINTING THAT JAIL MIGHT BE TOO SEVERE ON HER AND MIGHT BRING ON DEATH
I BADE THEM BOTH GOOD BY
THE STORIES OF THE INHUMAN TREATMENT AT OCCOQUAN WERE FALSE AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BELIEVE THEM FINALLY MISSUS YOUNG PLEADED TO BE ALLOWED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WARM CLOTHING TO HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE TOO LIGHTLY CLAD FOR THE VIGOROUS TEMPERATURE OF NOVEMBER
JUDGE MULLOWNY ADDRESSED THE PRISONERS WITH MANY HIGH SOUNDING WORDS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND INADVERTENTLY SLIPPED INTO A DISCOURSE ON RUSSIA AND THE DANGERS OF REVOLUTION
OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN MISSUS BRANNAN LIFE LONG SUFFRAGIST IS AN ARISTOCRAT OF INTELLECT AND FEELING WHO HAS ALWAYS ALLIED HERSELF WITH LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENTS THIS WAS HER SECOND TERM OF IMPRISONMENT
MY SISTER HUNGER STRUCK IN RUSSIA WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF TWO OF HER FRIENDS INDICTED FOR A GOVERNMENT OFFENSE SHE WAS FED AFTER THREE DAYS
THEY PUSHED ME THROUGH A DOOR THEN I LOST MY BALANCE AND FELL AGAINST THE IRON BED MISSUS COSU STRUCK THE WALL THEN THEY THREW IN TWO MATS AND TWO DIRTY BLANKETS
AND WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT LOOK AT US FURTHERMORE THE WATER CLOSETS WERE IN FULL VIEW OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER AND THE GUARDS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE FLUSHING OF THESE CLOSETS COULD ONLY BE DONE FROM THE CORRIDOR AND WE WERE FORCED TO ASK THE GUARDS TO DO THIS FOR US
AND WHICH WAS BEING CONTINUED AT THAT MOMENT MISS LUCY BURNS WHO HAD ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE WOMEN HAD MANAGED TO SECRETE SMALL SCRAPS OF PAPER AND A TINY PENCIL AND JOT DOWN BRIEFLY THE DAY BY DAY EVENTS AT THE WORKHOUSE
BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
AND SAID HE WISHED TO EXAMINE US BOTH REFUSED WERE DRAGGED THROUGH HALLS BY FORCE OUR CLOTHING PARTLY REMOVED BY FORCE AND WE WERE EXAMINED HEART TESTED BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE TAKEN OF COURSE SUCH DATA WAS OF NO VALUE AFTER SUCH A STRUGGLE DOCTOR GANNON TOLD ME THEN I MUST BE FED
IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
THE TUBE WAS WITHDRAWN I LAY MOTIONLESS AFTER A WHILE I WAS DRESSED AND CARRIED IN A CHAIR TO A WAITING AUTOMOBILE LAID ON THE BACK SEAT AND DRIVEN INTO WASHINGTON TO THE JAIL HOSPITAL PREVIOUS TO THE FEEDING
THEY TOOK ME TO MISTER WHITTAKER'S OFFICE
WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
HE BEGAN TO EXECUTE OR IMPRISON HIS OFFICERS AND TO DECIMATE HIS BEATEN TROOPS TO BE EMPLOYED BY HIM IN HIGH COMMAND WAS ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS TO BE APPOINTED A GENERAL IN CHIEF DURING THE DICTATORSHIP OF ROBESPIERRE
AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
HIS TROOPS GAINED SEVERAL VICTORIES OVER THE SARACENS
AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
LONG BEFORE HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF STATE CRAFT ERE HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR JUSTINIAN HAD PLUNGED INTO WAR WITH THE BULGARIANS HE ATTACKED THEM SUDDENLY INFLICTED SEVERAL DEFEATS ON THEIR KING
WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE SCHEME OF REFORM WHICH HE TOOK IN HAND THE NAME OF THE ICONOCLASTIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES WHICH FORMED ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES OF HIS ACTION
AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
THE ICONOCLASTS
NOT LEAST AMONG THE SIGNS OF A DECAYING CIVILIZATION WERE THE GROSS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAD GROWN UP OF LATE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
THERE WAS OF COURSE NO LEGALITY IN THE ACT AND KARL THE GREAT WAS IN NO REAL SENSE THE SUCCESSOR OF HONORIUS AND ROMULUS AUGUSTULUS BUT HE RULED A GROUP OF KINGDOMS WHICH EMBRACED THE LARGER HALF OF THE OLD WESTERN EMPIRE AND FORMED A FAIR EQUIPOISE TO THE REALM NOW RULED BY IRENE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THEN ONWARD WE HAVE ONCE MORE A WEST ROMAN EMPIRE IN EXISTENCE AS WELL AS THE EAST ROMAN
THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
MOST OF ITS POPULATION WERE MASSACRED
IN THE EARLY ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EAST ROMANS AND THE SARACENS THE SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND MORE REGULAR ARMS OF THE ONE
AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION
HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
AND WHEN HE SAW THE RUDE ARAB STANDING BY THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE CRIED ALOUD NOW IS THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY DANIEL THE PROPHET TRULY IN THE HOLY PLACE
GABATHA IN ITURAEA THOROUGHLY ROUSED BY THIS DISASTER HERACLIUS SET ALL THE LEGIONS OF THE EAST MARCHING AND SIXTY THOUSAND MEN CROSSED THE JORDAN AND ADVANCED TO RECOVER BOSTRA
TOOK THE TRUE CROSS FROM ITS SANCTUARY WHERE HE HAD REPLACED IT IN TRIUMPH FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND RETIRED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
THE DETAILS OF THE ARAB CONQUEST OF SYRIA HAVE NOT BEEN PRESERVED BY THE EAST ROMAN HISTORIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE HATED THE IDEA OF RECORDING THE DISASTERS OF CHRISTENDOM THE MOSLEMS ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NOT YET COMMENCED TO WRITE AND ERE HISTORIANS AROSE AMONG THEM
IS NOT A THING TO BE DESPISED
BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
NOR SCOFF WITH GIBBON AT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE TROOPS WHO WERE ROUTED BY THEM IF THE SOLDIERS OF QUEEN VICTORIA ARMED WITH MODERN RIFLES AND ARTILLERY FOUND THE FANATICAL ARAB A FORMIDABLE FOE LET US NOT BLAME THE SOLDIERS OF HERACLIUS WHO FACED THE SAME ENEMY
THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
PARADISE IS BEFORE YOU THE DEVIL AND HELL FIRE BEHIND THE FANATICAL ORIENTALS THREW THEMSELVES ON REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND DROVE IT OFF THE FIELD ALL SYRIA EAST OF JORDAN WAS LOST IN THIS FATAL BATTLE DAMASCUS ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD
GOD WAS GOD AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET
AND TO DO SO HAD NOT ONLY DRAINED THE TREASURY BUT IMPOSED SOME NEW AND UNWISE TAXES ON THE HARASSED PROVINCIALS AND DISBANDED MANY OF HIS VETERANS FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY
BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
THEY SEEM TO HAVE CONSTITUTED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION AND BITTERLY RESENTED THE ENDEAVOURS OF HERACLIUS TO ENFORCE ORTHODOXY IN THE RECONQUERED PROVINCES THEIR DISCONTENT WAS SO BITTER
THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
BY MY MASTER IN THIS WRITING MUST BE UNDERSTOOD QUINNAPIN WHO WAS A SAGAMORE AND MARRIED KING PHILIP'S WIFE'S SISTER NOT THAT HE FIRST TOOK ME BUT I WAS SOLD TO HIM BY ANOTHER NARRAGANSETT INDIAN WHO TOOK ME WHEN FIRST I CAME OUT OF THE GARRISON
SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
AND THEN THEY MADE A STOP AND CHOSE SOME OF THEIR STOUTEST MEN AND SENT THEM BACK TO HOLD THE ENGLISH ARMY IN PLAY WHILST THE REST ESCAPED AND THEN LIKE JEHU THEY MARCHED ON FURIOUSLY WITH THEIR OLD AND WITH THEIR YOUNG SOME CARRIED THEIR OLD DECREPIT MOTHERS
AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ
WHEN I CAME I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UPON THE HILL
BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND HE SHALL STRENGTHEN THINE HEART WAIT I SAY ON THE LORD THE FOURTH REMOVE AND NOW I MUST PART WITH THAT LITTLE COMPANY I HAD
AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED THEY KNOCKED HER ON HEAD AND THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY MADE A FIRE AND PUT THEM BOTH INTO IT
AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
AND AS I WAS GOING ALONG MY HEART WAS EVEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MY CONDITION AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN AND A NATION WHICH I KNEW NOT RULED OVER THEM WHEREUPON I EARNESTLY ENTREATED THE LORD THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER MY LOW ESTATE AND SHOW ME A TOKEN FOR GOOD AND IF IT WERE HIS BLESSED WILL
I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE WONDERFUL MERCY OF GOD TO ME IN THOSE AFFLICTIONS IN SENDING ME A BIBLE ONE OF THE INDIANS THAT CAME FROM MEDFIELD FIGHT HAD BROUGHT SOME PLUNDER CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE A BIBLE HE HAD GOT ONE IN HIS BASKET
THE CHILDREN SAID SHE DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT PRAYED ALL THE WHILE
UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER THERE WERE NOW BESIDES MYSELF NINE ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN THIS PLACE ALL OF THEM CHILDREN EXCEPT ONE WOMAN
MY WOUNDS STINK AND ARE CORRUPT I AM TROUBLED I AM BOWED DOWN GREATLY I GO MOURNING ALL THE DAY LONG I SAT MUCH ALONE WITH A POOR WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP WHICH MOANED NIGHT AND DAY HAVING NOTHING TO REVIVE THE BODY OR CHEER THE SPIRITS OF HER BUT INSTEAD OF THAT
SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
THOUGH THERE WERE NONE BUT OUR OWN COMPANY THE INDIANS WERE AS THICK AS THE TREES IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A THOUSAND HATCHETS GOING AT ONCE IF ONE LOOKED BEFORE ONE THERE WAS NOTHING BUT INDIANS AND BEHIND ONE NOTHING BUT INDIANS
WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
AND WERE GATHERED TOGETHER I THOUGHT TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF THEM BUT THEY WERE SO MANY AND BEING SOMEWHAT IN MOTION IT WAS BEYOND MY SKILL IN THIS TRAVEL BECAUSE OF MY WOUND I WAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED IN MY LOAD I CARRIED ONLY MY KNITTING WORK AND TWO QUARTS OF PARCHED MEAL
THEY BEING TO GO ONE WAY AND I ANOTHER I ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WERE EARNEST WITH GOD FOR DELIVERANCE THEY TOLD ME THEY DID AS THEY WERE ABLE AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO ME THAT THE LORD STIRRED UP CHILDREN TO LOOK TO HIM
I TOLD THEM IT WAS THE SABBATH DAY AND DESIRED THEM TO LET ME REST AND TOLD THEM I WOULD DO AS MUCH MORE TOMORROW TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD BREAK MY FACE AND HERE I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE STRANGE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN PRESERVING THE HEATHEN
BY ONE EYED JOHN AND MARLBOROUGH'S PRAYING INDIANS WHICH CAPTAIN MOSELY BROUGHT TO BOSTON AS THE INDIANS TOLD ME THE SECOND REMOVE BUT NOW THE NEXT MORNING I MUST TURN MY BACK UPON THE TOWN AND TRAVEL WITH THEM INTO THE VAST AND DESOLATE WILDERNESS
I ASKED THEM WHETHER I MIGHT NOT LODGE IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED WHAT WILL YOU LOVE ENGLISH MEN STILL THIS WAS THE DOLEFULEST NIGHT THAT EVER MY EYES SAW OH THE ROARING AND SINGING AND DANCING AND YELLING OF THOSE BLACK CREATURES IN THE NIGHT
THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION WITHOUT ANY REFRESHING OF ONE NATURE OR OTHER EXCEPT A LITTLE COLD WATER I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE HOW AT ANOTHER TIME I COULD NOT BEAR TO BE IN THE ROOM WHERE ANY DEAD PERSON WAS
THE FIRST WEEK OF MY BEING AMONG THEM I HARDLY ATE ANY THING THE SECOND WEEK I FOUND MY STOMACH GROW VERY FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMETHING AND YET IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET DOWN THEIR FILTHY TRASH BUT THE THIRD WEEK
WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
GOD HAVING TAKEN AWAY THIS DEAR CHILD I WENT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER MARY WHO WAS AT THIS SAME INDIAN TOWN AT A WIGWAM NOT VERY FAR OFF
I KNEW NOT WHITHER IT IS NOT MY TONGUE OR PEN CAN EXPRESS THE SORROWS OF MY HEART AND BITTERNESS OF MY SPIRIT THAT I HAD AT THIS DEPARTURE BUT GOD WAS WITH ME IN A WONDERFUL MANNER CARRYING ME ALONG AND BEARING UP MY SPIRIT
ALL THE COMPANY FOR THOSE THAT BELONGED TO THE OTHER SMALL COMPANY CAME THROUGH THE TOWN THAT NOW WE WERE AT BUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO US OH THE OUTRAGEOUS ROARING AND HOOPING THAT THERE WAS THEY BEGAN THEIR DIN ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THEY CAME TO US
ONE OF THE INDIANS GOT UP UPON A HORSE AND THEY SET ME UP BEHIND HIM WITH MY POOR SICK BABE IN MY LAP A VERY WEARISOME AND TEDIOUS DAY I HAD OF IT WHAT WITH MY OWN WOUND AND MY CHILD'S BEING SO EXCEEDING SICK AND IN A LAMENTABLE CONDITION WITH HER WOUND
THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
AT WHICH THEY LIKE INHUMANE CREATURES LAUGHED AND REJOICED TO SEE IT THOUGH I THOUGHT WE SHOULD THERE HAVE ENDED OUR DAYS AS OVERCOME WITH SO MANY DIFFICULTIES BUT THE LORD RENEWED MY STRENGTH STILL AND CARRIED ME ALONG THAT I MIGHT SEE MORE OF HIS POWER
THIS DAY IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT AN HOUR BY SUN
IF WE HAD BEEN GOD WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT A WAY FOR THE ENGLISH TO HAVE PASSED THIS RIVER AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIANS WITH THEIR SQUAWS AND CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR LUGGAGE OH THAT MY PEOPLE HAD HEARKENED TO ME AND ISRAEL HAD WALKED IN MY WAYS
SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
MY OWN WOUND ALSO GROWING SO STIFF THAT I COULD SCARCE SIT DOWN OR RISE UP YET SO IT MUST BE THAT I MUST SIT ALL THIS COLD WINTER NIGHT UPON THE COLD SNOWY GROUND WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY ARMS
THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
THERE WAS NO RESISTING BUT GO I MUST AND LEAVE IT WHEN I HAD BEEN AT MY MASTER'S WIGWAM
AND WE WERE BOTH ALIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT MORNING THE THIRD REMOVE
MY CHILDREN GONE MY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS GONE OUR HOUSE AND HOME AND ALL OUR COMFORTS WITHIN DOOR AND WITHOUT ALL WAS GONE EXCEPT MY LIFE AND I KNEW NOT BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THAT MIGHT GO TOO THERE REMAINED NOTHING TO ME BUT ONE POOR WOUNDED BABE
AND THERE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD BURIED IT
THAT IT DID NOT QUITE FAIL ONE OF THE INDIANS CARRIED MY POOR WOUNDED BABE UPON A HORSE IT WENT MOANING ALL ALONG I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I WENT ON FOOT AFTER IT WITH SORROW THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED AT LENGTH I TOOK IT OFF THE HORSE
I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW
AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER
AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO
AS MY MASTER SPAKE BUT INSTEAD OF THAT MY MASTER HIMSELF WAS GONE AND I LEFT BEHIND SO THAT MY SPIRIT WAS NOW QUITE READY TO SINK I ASKED THEM TO LET ME GO OUT AND PICK UP SOME STICKS THAT I MIGHT GET ALONE AND POUR OUT MY HEART UNTO THE LORD
EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME TO MY REMEMBRANCE THAT I WEPT BEFORE THEM ALTHOUGH I HAD MET WITH SO MUCH AFFLICTION AND MY HEART WAS MANY TIMES READY TO BREAK YET COULD I NOT SHED ONE TEAR IN THEIR SIGHT BUT RATHER
WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
AND I WAS NOT A LITTLE GLAD THAT I HAD ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT OF AND BE PLEASED WITH WHEN WE WERE AT THIS PLACE MY MASTER'S MAID CAME HOME SHE HAD BEEN GONE THREE WEEKS INTO THE NARRAGANSETT COUNTRY TO FETCH CORN
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
AND SELL ME FOR POWDER FOR SO THEY HAD SOMETIMES DISCOURSED I WAS UTTERLY HOPELESS OF GETTING HOME ON FOOT THE WAY THAT I CAME I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF THE MANY WEARY STEPS I HAD TAKEN TO COME TO THIS PLACE THE NINTH REMOVE
WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS
AND HE LIGHTED UPON THAT COMFORTABLE SCRIPTURE I SHALL NOT DIE BUT LIVE AND DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD
YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE
AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE
THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING
WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND
IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
IN BRINGING TO MY HAND SO MANY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE SCRIPTURES IN MY DISTRESS BUT TO RETURN
AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT
I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS
AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE
WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN
AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID
BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
WERE GOING TO THE FRENCH FOR POWDER BUT BY THE WAY THE MOHAWKS MET WITH THEM AND KILLED FOUR OF THEIR COMPANY WHICH MADE THE REST TURN BACK AGAIN FOR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN SOLD TO THE FRENCH
WHEN I HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE PIPES I WAS PRESENTLY READY FOR ANOTHER SUCH A BEWITCHING THING IT IS BUT I THANK GOD HE HAS NOW GIVEN ME POWER OVER IT SURELY THERE ARE MANY WHO
THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
THEN CAME ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ME TWO SPOONFULS OF MEAL TO COMFORT ME AND ANOTHER GAVE ME HALF A PINT OF PEAS WHICH WAS MORE WORTH THAN MANY BUSHELS AT ANOTHER TIME THEN I WENT TO SEE KING PHILIP HE BADE ME COME IN AND SIT DOWN
DURING MY ABODE IN THIS PLACE PHILIP SPAKE TO ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HIS BOY WHICH I DID FOR WHICH HE GAVE ME A SHILLING I OFFERED THE MONEY TO MY MASTER BUT HE BADE ME KEEP IT AND WITH IT I BOUGHT A PIECE OF HORSE FLESH
THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE
I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
AND IN THE MORNING WE MUST GO OVER THE RIVER TO PHILIP'S CREW
AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT TELL WHERE TO GO THEY BADE ME GO LOOK I TOLD THEM IF I WENT TO ANOTHER WIGWAM THEY WOULD BE ANGRY AND SEND ME HOME AGAIN THEN ONE OF THE COMPANY DREW HIS SWORD AND TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN ME THROUGH IF I DID NOT GO PRESENTLY THEN
BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SATE DOWN
I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE
AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE
AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD
BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
NEVER LET THE MACHINE BUCKLE THERE WAS A MAN KILLED ONLY THE OTHER DAY THROUGH HIS WHEEL BUCKLING DON'T SCORCH DON'T RIDE ON THE FOOT PATH KEEP YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IF YOU SEE A TRAMLINE GO ROUND THE CORNER AT ONCE AND HURRY OFF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY
THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
THEY'RE GOING FAIRLY WELL SIR
A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
CARRY ONE OR TWO LEMONS WITH YOU DON'T TEAR YOURSELF TO DEATH THE FIRST DAY AND SIT UPRIGHT NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND ALWAYS SOUND THE BELL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY YOU MIND THOSE THINGS AND NOTHING VERY MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU HOOPDRIVER YOU TAKE MY WORD
OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS
BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
SAVE PERHAPS FOR A CURSE OR SO AT HIS PIPE AND THEN BREAK OUT WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF TIPS AVOID RUNNING OVER DOGS HOOPDRIVER WHATEVER YOU DO
ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH
HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
TO BE A HUMAN BEING NOT A THING IN A HUTCH AND HE I KNOW SAID HOOPDRIVER AND NOW HERE I AM I WILL DO ANYTHING SAID HOOPDRIVER SHE THOUGHT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STEPMOTHER NO I COULD NOT DESCRIBE HER
THEN WITH INFINITE FERVOUR HE SAID BUT LET US PUT IN BLANK CARTRIDGE HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMCHAIR DAMN HER SAID BECHAMEL FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A COMMON MAN
THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
YOU ARE SAFE SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SWEEPING OFF HIS CAP WITH AN AIR AND BOWING COURTLY WHERE ARE WE SAFE BUT WHERE CHICHESTER HARBOUR HE WAVED HIS ARM SEAWARD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GOAL DO YOU THINK THEY WILL FOLLOW US
PROMISED TO HELP AND PROTECT ME I WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME NEVER MIND WHY A STEPMOTHER IDLE UNOCCUPIED HINDERED CRAMPED THAT IS ENOUGH PERHAPS THEN HE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND TALKED TO ME OF ART AND LITERATURE AND SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE
HE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHAME OF HIS HOMELY PATRONYMIC IT'S AN UGLY NAME HE SAID BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN TRUSTING ME I WOULD I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU THIS
WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE
MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
GRAVE AND INTENT HOW COULD SHE EVER HAVE THOUGHT HIM COMMON OR ABSURD BUT YOU MUST TELL ME YOUR NAME BROTHER SHE SAID ER CARRINGTON SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE
HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
AN OTHER GENTLEMEN WHO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN BROWN SIR WENT INTO THE YARD SIR GOT OUT THE TWO BICYCLES SIR AND WENT OFF SIR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO BECHAMEL STOOD WITH HIS EYES ROUND AND HIS KNUCKLE ON HIS HIPS
IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
ARE YOU TIRED HE ASKED I WILL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE THE TWO BLACK FIGURES IN THE BROKEN LIGHT WERE SILENT FOR A SPACE DO YOU KNOW SHE SAID I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU I AM SURE YOU ARE HONEST TO ME
AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
BUT AS YET HE SEEMED MERELY STUNNED BROWN CLOTHES HE SAID AND FAIRISH A LITTLE LIKE YOURSELF SIR IN THE DARK THE OSTLER SIR JIM DUKE
YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR BROTHER MISS BEAUMONT YES WE COULD STOP THERE TOGETHER SHE TOOK A MINUTE TO ANSWER I AM GOING TO LIGHT THESE LAMPS SAID HOOPDRIVER HE BENT DOWN TO HIS OWN AND STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS SHOE
WHAT WE HAD BEST BE DOING YOU ARE TIRED YOU KNOW AND WE CAN'T WANDER ALL NIGHT AFTER THE DAY WE'VE HAD THAT WAS CHICHESTER WE WERE NEAR SHE ASKED IF HE MEDITATED WITH A TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE
AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
MAKING A MEMORABLE SAYING LET EM GO WHO CARES AND I WISH HIM LUCK AND BRING ME SOME BOURBON AS FAST AS YOU CAN THERE'S A GOOD CHAP
THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH TO BREAK THE INTENSITY HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SHUT IT AGAIN AND WITH A SUDDEN WINCING OF HIS FEATURES ABRUPTLY TURNED AND BENT DOWN TO OPEN THE LANTERN IN FRONT OF HER MACHINE SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
WHO WOULD BE HOOPDRIVER ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS BUT THE CHRISTIAN NAME CHRISTIAN NAME MY CHRISTIAN NAME WELL CHRIS HE SNAPPED HIS LAMP AND STOOD UP IF YOU WILL HOLD MY MACHINE I WILL LIGHT YOURS HE SAID
HE ROSE WITH A FINE SURPRISE GONE HE SAID WITH A HALF LAUGH GONE SIR ON HER BICYCLE ON HER BICYCLE WHY SHE WENT SIR WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THIS TIME BECHAMEL WAS REALLY STARTLED
THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
AFTER A PAUSE BECHAMEL WENT BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY HEARD A CHAIR CREAK UNDER HIM INTERLUDE OF CONVERSATIONAL EYEBROWS I'M GOING UP SAID STEPHEN TO BREAK THE MELANCHOLY NEWS TO HIM BECHAMEL LOOKED UP FROM A WEEK OLD NEWSPAPER
HULLO SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SOTTO VOCE THEY DISMOUNTED ABRUPTLY STUNTED OAKS AND THORNS ROSE OUT OF THE HAZE OF MOONLIGHT THAT WAS TANGLED IN THE HEDGE ON EITHER SIDE
KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING SAID HOOPDRIVER WITH SPLENDID READINESS MY SISTER HAD GONE TO BOGNOR BUT I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE I'VE TOOK A FANCY TO THIS PLACE AND THE MOONLIGHT'S SIMPLY DEE VINE WE'VE HAD SUPPER THENKS AND WE'RE TIRED SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER
IT WASN'T THAT ONE AT ALL MISS SAID THE OSTLER I'D SWEAR WELL THAT'S MISTER BEAUMONT SAID THE BARMAID ANYHOW THEIR CONVERSATION HUNG COMATOSE IN THE AIR SWITCHED UP BY BECHAMEL
WE HAVE TURNED AND TURNED AGAIN IT SEEMED TO HOOPDRIVER THAT HE HEARD HER SOB SHE STOOD DIMLY THERE HOLDING HER MACHINE AND HE HOLDING HIS COULD GO NO NEARER TO HER TO SEE IF SHE SOBBED FOR WEEPING OR FOR WANT OF BREATH
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY POWER I HAVE LOST AN ILLUSION AND FOUND A KNIGHT ERRANT SHE SPOKE OF BECHAMEL AS THE ILLUSION MISTER HOOPDRIVER FELT FLATTERED BUT HE HAD NO ADEQUATE ANSWER
NOWHERE WAS THE MOON SHINING QUITE SO BRIGHTLY AS IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S SKULL AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD HE MADE HIS DECISIONS WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND PROMPTITUDE AND QUITE HAPHAZARD THE RIGHT HE WOULD SAY OR AGAIN
THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD
SHE WHO HAS SPIRITUALISED THE WORLD ALONE SAVE FOR TWO ATTENDANT STEADY SHINING STARS AND IN SILENCE UNDER HER BENIGN INFLUENCE UNDER THE BENEDICTION OF HER LIGHT RODE OUR TWO WANDERERS SIDE BY SIDE THROUGH THE TRANSFIGURED AND TRANSFIGURING NIGHT
AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
THE LEFT AS ONE WHO KNEW SO IT WAS THAT IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR THEY CAME ABRUPTLY DOWN A LITTLE LANE FULL TILT UPON THE SEA
HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
I'LL CHUCK THIS INFERNAL BUSINESS THEY'VE GONE EIGH YESSIR
THEY LISTENED TOGETHER HIS FEET STOPPED TURNED WENT OUT OF THE DININGROOM DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE BEDROOM STOPPED AGAIN POOR CHAP SAID THE BARMAID SHE'S A WICKED WOMAN SSSH SAID STEPHEN
IF SO HE WAS IN FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT HE HAD IT READY SHE WAS A MONOMANIAC LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HER HE WOULD SAY I KNOW HOW TO CALM HER MISSUS BEAUMONT SAID STEPHEN WELL HAS GONE
STEPHEN WAS TOO SURPRISED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT BOURBON SIR GO ON SAID BECHAMEL DAMN YOU STEPHEN'S SYMPATHIES CHANGED AT ONCE YESSIR HE MURMURED FUMBLING FOR THE DOOR HANDLE AND LEFT THE ROOM MARVELLING
THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL
BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF
THE MUTE EMOTION OF HIS FACE AFFECTED HER STRANGELY SHE HAD TO SPEAK
HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
AND IT WAS CHIEFLY BY GOOD LUCK AND THE FACT THAT MOST ROADS ABOUT A TOWN CONVERGE THEREUPON THAT CHICHESTER WAS AT LAST ATTAINED IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BUT THE RED HOTEL STILL GLOWED YELLOW AND WARM
AS WITHOUT KNOCKING STEPHEN ENTERED BECHAMEL'S FACE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION BEG PARDON SIR SAID STEPHEN WITH A DIPLOMATIC COUGH WELL SAID BECHAMEL WONDERING SUDDENLY IF JESSIE HAD KEPT SOME OF HER THREATS
GRANNIE GRANNIE OPEN THE DOOR I HAVE NO SON AND NO GRANDCHILDREN TO CALL ME GRANNIE GRUMBLED THE OLD WOMAN AND WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SEE WHO WAS THERE AND WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM SHE SAID HO
HE ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS EATING SOME PULSE I GOT FROM THE VILLAGE HEADMAN GIVE ME A LITTLE TO TRY HE BEGGED I AM SORRY MY CHILD I HAVE FINISHED IT ALL
AND CLIMBED UP A TALL SAL TREE FROM THE TREE HE WATCHED THE BISON GO DOWN TO THE WATER TO DRINK AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE JUNGLE AND AFTER THEM TIGERS AND BEARS CAME DOWN TO THE WATER
YOU ARE MY GRANDSON YES ANSWERED HE I AM YOUR GRANDCHILD SO SHE CALLED HIM INSIDE AND GAVE HIM A BED TO SLEEP ON THE OLD WOMAN WAS CALLED HUTIBUDI
AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE WHICH HAD THE DRIED UP BODY OF THE BOY'S FATHER STUCK ON ITS HORN THE BOY WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED AND SANG
HE CAME TO A LAKE AND HE SAT DOWN BY IT TO EAT WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE PROVISIONS HE HAD BROUGHT AS HE SAT HE SUDDENLY SAW SOME COW BISON COMING DOWN TO THE LAKE AT THIS HE CAUGHT UP HIS BOW AND ARROWS IN A HURRY
AND THEN WHIP THE BODY WITH A MERAL TWIG AND HE WILL COME TO LIFE SO SAYING THE STRANGER SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND THE BOY OBEYED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND BEHOLD HIS FATHER SAT UP ALIVE AND RUBBING HIS EYES SAID
HE PUT AN ARROW THROUGH IT AND IT TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND FELL OVER DEAD
BUT THIS ONLY BROKE HER TEETH AND MADE HER MOUTH BLEED SO THAT THE PAIN WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEN THE BOY JEERED AT HER AND SAID DID YOU THINK GRANNIE THAT YOU COULD BITE MY IRON BOW AND ARROWS SO SAYING HE LEFT HER
AND CONTINUED THE SEARCH FOR HIS FATHER
I MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP A VERY LONG TIME THEN HIS SON EXPLAINED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND GAVE HIM SOME FOOD
AND SHE AND THE BOY SAT UP LATE TALKING TOGETHER AND THEN THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE HEARD THE OLD WOMAN CRUNCHING AWAY TRYING TO BITE HIS BOW TO PIECES
BUT REALLY SHE HAD NONE TO GIVE HOWEVER SHE ONLY HURT HER JAWS BITING SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO GROAN WITH PAIN WHAT ARE YOU GROANING FOR GRANNIE SAID THE BOY
AND HE STARTED OFF TAKING WITH HIM AN IRON BOW AND A BIG BUNDLE OF ARROWS HE JOURNEYED ON ALL DAY AND AT NIGHTFALL HE CAME TO A VILLAGE THERE HE WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF AN OLD WOMAN TO ASK FOR A BED
AND RAN AWAY THEN THE BOY CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND PULLED THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FATHER OFF THE HORN OF THE DEAD ANIMAL AND LAID IT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF A TREE AND BEGAN TO WEEP OVER IT AS HE WEPT
HE IS ALIVE SAID SHE BUT A LONG TIME AGO A RHINOCEROS CARRIED HIM OFF ON ITS HORN THEN THE BOY VOWED THAT HE WOULD GO IN SEARCH OF HIS FATHER AND MADE HIS MOTHER PUT HIM UP PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
AND THEY DRANK AND WENT AWAY THEN VARIOUS KINDS OF BIRDS CAME
A MAN SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHEN HE HEARD SAID CRY NO MORE TAKE A CLOTH AND WET IT IN THE LAKE AND COVER YOUR FATHER'S BODY WITH IT
AND IN TRUTH HER CHEEKS WERE BADLY SWOLLEN THEN HE TOLD HER THAT A GOOD CURE FOR TOOTHACHE WAS TO BITE ON A WHITE STONE AND SHE BELIEVED HIM AND THE NEXT MORNING GOT A PIECE OF WHITE QUARTZ AND BEGAN TO BITE ON IT
THE SIGHT OF THEM FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE SANG DRINK YOUR FILL TIGER I SHALL NOT SHOOT YOU
AND FOR THIS THE VILLAGE BOYS WITH WHOM HE PLAYED USED TO QUARREL WITH HIM SAYING FATHERLESS ORPHAN WHY DO YOU CHEAT SO ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER WHY THEY CALLED HIM THAT NAME AND WHETHER HIS FATHER WAS REALLY DEAD
NOR DOES ITS USE OR SIGNIFICANCE
THINGS ACT ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS ON US BY MEANS OF THEIR SECONDARY QUALITIES SOUND AS SUCH GOES THROUGH THE AIR AND CAN BE INTERCEPTED
TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE LET THE READER ARREST HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF READING THIS ARTICLE NOW
IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE
ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
EVEN SUCH THINGS AS FORCES TENSIONS AND ACTIVITIES CAN AT A PINCH BE REGARDED AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTIONS SO FAR THEN AS THE PHYSICAL WORLD MEANS THE COLLECTION OF CONTENTS THAT DETERMINE IN EACH OTHER CERTAIN REGULAR CHANGES
BUT ONLY A TRANSLOCATION OF EXPERIENCES FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER A GROUPING OF THEM WITH ONE SET OR ANOTHER OF ASSOCIATES FOR DEFINITELY PRACTICAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENDS
I WILL SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE PERSISTENT AMBIGUITY OF RELATIONS THEY ARE UNDENIABLE PARTS OF PURE EXPERIENCE YET WHILE COMMON SENSE AND WHAT I CALL RADICAL EMPIRICISM STAND FOR THEIR BEING OBJECTIVE
IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP
TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
NATURE EXHIBITS ONLY CHANGES WHICH HABITUALLY COINCIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
ITS SENSORIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE MY ATTENTION
THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF OUR APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES HAS TO BE TREATED AS FALLING OUTSIDE OF IT IF WE MEAN BY PHYSICAL NATURE WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THE SURFACE OF OUR BODIES
AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
BOTH RATIONALISM AND THE USUAL EMPIRICISM CLAIM THAT THEY ARE EXCLUSIVELY THE WORK OF THE MIND' THE FINITE MIND OR THE ABSOLUTE MIND AS THE CASE MAY BE
OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED
IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
BUT NOT ASCRIBED CORRECTLY TO THE BODY THAT REALLY MOVES THUS IN OPTICAL VERTIGO CAUSED BY UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENTS OF OUR EYES BOTH WE AND THE EXTERNAL UNIVERSE APPEAR TO BE IN A WHIRL
AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
SOMETIMES AGAIN I THINK OF IT AS MINE I SORT IT WITH THE ME AND THEN CERTAIN LOCAL CHANGES AND DETERMINATIONS IN IT PASS FOR SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS ITS BREATHING IS MY THINKING
OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
AN AGREEABLE DEGREE OF HEAT OR AN AGREEABLE FEELING OCCASIONED BY THE DEGREE OF HEAT EITHER WILL DO AND LANGUAGE WOULD LOSE MOST OF ITS ESTHETIC AND RHETORICAL VALUE
THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
THEY YET ACT ON EACH OTHER IN THE MOST ENERGETIC WAY BY THOSE VERY CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SO INERT EXTRACORPOREALLY IT IS BY THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THAT EXPERIENCES HAVE FOR US BY THE EMOTIONS THEY EXCITE
AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
NOTICED AN ATTENDANT WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE IDENTIFIED THE MOVEMENT WITH THAT OF HIS OWN HE DID NOT YET DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS OWN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE HIMSELF
IT IS THEIR WAY OF BEHAVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEIR SYSTEM OF RELATIONS THEIR FUNCTION AND ALL THESE THINGS VARY WITH THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND IT OPPORTUNE TO CONSIDER THEM I THINK I MAY CONCLUDE THEN
IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
THAT HOWEVER IS ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING CLASSED AS ABSOLUTELY NON OBJECTIVE THE ATTEMPT IF ANY ONE SHOULD MAKE IT TO SORT EXPERIENCES INTO TWO ABSOLUTELY DISCRETE GROUPS
CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
TAKE A MASS OF CARRION FOR EXAMPLE
PROVE HOW HARD IT IS TO DECIDE BY BARE INTROSPECTION WHAT IT IS IN EXPERIENCES THAT SHALL MAKE THEM EITHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL IT SURELY CAN BE NOTHING INTRINSIC IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF CALLING THESE QUALITIES SUBJECTIVE WHEN HOWEVER GALILEO DESCARTES AND OTHERS FOUND IT BEST FOR PHILOSOPHIC PURPOSES TO CLASS SOUND HEAT AND LIGHT ALONG WITH PAIN AND PLEASURE AS PURELY MENTAL PHENOMENA
THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
ITS VISCERAL PERTURBATIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS THE OBSTINATE CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ARISEN OVER SUCH STATEMENTS AS THESE WHICH SOUND SO PARADOXICAL AND WHICH CAN YET BE MADE SO SERIOUSLY
BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
ALL IN THEMSELVES AND QUITE APART FROM OUR OPINION WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TALK OF A WEARY ROAD A GIDDY HEIGHT A JOCUND MORNING OR A SULLEN SKY
WE SHALL PROBABLY JUDGE IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH WITH THE AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ARE CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY PURE CONDITION LASTS IN PRACTICAL LIFE NO URGENT NEED HAS YET ARISEN FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT THEM AS RIGOROUSLY MENTAL
IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HOWEVER BE AN UNNATURAL STATUS IF THE POPULAR OPINION WHICH I CITED AT THE OUTSET WERE CORRECT IF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MEANT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTRINSIC NATURE
BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT
MEANS ALSO THAT IT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE BODILY EFFECTS UPON US ALTERATIONS OF TONE AND TENSION OF HEART BEAT AND BREATHING OF VASCULAR AND VISCERAL ACTION
PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY
FITNESS FIXES THEIR ORDER AND CONNECTION I NEED ONLY REFER FOR THIS ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL LIFE
THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT BY THE MOON IT IS AS IF BOTH CLOUDS AND MOON AND WE OURSELVES SHARED IN THE MOTION IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF AMNESIA
AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
AND I HOPE THAT MY READERS ARE NOW READY TO CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE PRETENDED SPIRITUALITY OF OUR EMOTIONS AND OF OUR ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE SO FAR FROM PROVING AN OBJECTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PURE EXPERIENCE DOES WHEN RIGHTLY DISCUSSED AND ACCOUNTED FOR
THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
AND DOUBTLESS PASSES WITH MOST READERS FOR ALL RIGHT PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDYING OUR PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENT HAVE UNEARTHED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH MOVEMENT IS FELT IN GENERAL
IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN
THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS
THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER
JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
THE MAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS PIECE OF WORK LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHAT'S HIS NAME ASKED NICOLAS HE IS MAJOR GEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE CITY IN WHICH HE LIVES LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS
ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER
ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU
THE SCOTCH PEOPLE WANTED TO OWN THE PORTRAIT OF CARLYLE AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW WAS GLAD TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT MISTER WHISTLER MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS HERSELF AN ARTIST AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM
HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU
MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
HE TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL PAINTING VIEWS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND STUDYING THE PICTURES OF OTHER ARTISTS BUT HOGARTH WAS HIS FAVORITE AND IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER LIES BURIED VERY NEAR HOGARTH IN LONDON
HE IS A DISTINGUISHED ARMY OFFICER AND A FINE ENGINEER HE IS NAMED FOR A GREAT OFFICER ANSWERED NICOLAS REMEMBERING OUR GENERAL WASHINGTON AND HE DISPATCHED A LETTER TO THE LOWELL ENGINEER
YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS
BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER
BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS WORTH NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE HEARD THE TALK THAT WENT ON IN THE COURT ROOM LATER MISTER WHISTLER RECEIVED MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR A SINGLE PICTURE
BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY
WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR
JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER
SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES
SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE
JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG
WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES
THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER
IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR
THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
AND FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A COMMANDER AND A CHEVALIER
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS
AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
AND WE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD PUSHED ON DOWN THE STREAM I DETERMINED TO KEEP OUT FROM THE RIVER ALONG WHICH IT WAS NEARLY IMPRACTICABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ANIMALS UNTIL IT SHOULD FORM A VALLEY
UNBROKEN BY RAVINES AND COVERED WITH PINES AND SNOW WHILE ON THE SIDE WE WERE TRAVELLING INNUMERABLE RIVULETS POURED DOWN FROM THE RIDGE
NEARLY INTOXICATED US WITH DELIGHT AND WE HURRIED ON FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT TO ESCAPE ENTIRELY FROM THE HORRID REGION OF INHOSPITABLE SNOW TO THE PERPETUAL SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO
CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE OAK TREES APPEARED ON THE RIDGE AND SOON BECAME VERY FREQUENT ON THESE I REMARKED UNUSUALLY GREAT QUANTITIES OF MISTLETOE THE OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS VERY STEEP AND CONTINUOUS
BOTH WERE VOLUNTEERS AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN WAS PROMISED A PAIR OF PISTOLS NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR A SERVICE WHICH WOULD FREE US ALL FROM MUCH ANXIETY
AND OCCASIONALLY WE PASSED A HILL SCATTERINGLY COVERED WITH IT THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST CONTINUED THE SAME AND AMONG THE TREES THE PINE WITH SHARP LEAVES AND VERY LARGE CONES WAS ABUNDANT SOME OF THEM BEING NOBLE TREES
SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL
WE DROVE ALONG OUR HORSES AND ENCAMPED AT THE PLACE ABOUT DARK AND THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO MAKE A PLACE FOR SHELTER ON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM THREE HORSES WERE LOST TODAY PROVEAU
CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES
AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
WHEN HORSES DIED AND WHEN MULES AND HORSES READY TO DIE OF STARVATION WERE KILLED FOR FOOD YET THERE WAS NO MURMURING OR HESITATION IN THE MEANTIME MISTER PREUSS CONTINUED ON DOWN THE RIVER
WHEN IT WAS A COLD MOUNTAIN TORRENT FOAMING AMONG THE ROCKS
HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
BUT THE COLD DROVE US OUT AND MAKING A LARGE FIRE ON THE BANK AFTER WE HAD PARTIALLY DRIED OURSELVES WE WENT BACK TO MEET THE CAMP WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE GUN HAD BEEN SLUNG UNDER THE ICE WHICH LINED THE BANKS OF THE CREEK
IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
WHO MISTAKING US FOR HIS FELLOWS HAD BEEN ONLY UNDECEIVED BY GETTING CLOSE UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO WITNESS HIS ASTONISHMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED HAD SOME OF THE OLD MOUNTAIN SPIRITS THEY ARE SO MUCH AFRAID OF
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK
WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
NEAR NIGHT FALL WE DESCENDED INTO THE STEEP RAVINE OF A HANDSOME CREEK THIRTY FEET WIDE AND I WAS ENGAGED IN GETTING THE HORSES UP THE OPPOSITE HILL WHEN I HEARD A SHOUT FROM CARSON WHO HAD GONE AHEAD A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION
SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
IN A SHORT DISTANCE WE CROSSED A LITTLE RIVULET WHERE WERE TWO OLD HUTS AND NEAR BY WERE HEAPS OF ACORN HULLS THE GROUND ROUND ABOUT WAS VERY RICH COVERED WITH AN EXUBERANT SWARD OF GRASS
A FINE YOUNG HORSE FROM THE COLUMBIA BELONGING TO CHARLES TOWNS AND ANOTHER INDIAN HORSE WHICH CARRIED OUR COOKING UTENSILS THE TWO FORMER GAVE OUT AND THE LATTER STRAYED OFF INTO THE WOODS AS WE REACHED THE CAMP
THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
ON THE SHORE OF THE BAY EIGHTY MILES DISTANT AXES AND MAULS WERE NECESSARY TODAY TO MAKE A ROAD THROUGH THE SNOW GOING AHEAD WITH CARSON TO RECONNOITRE THE ROAD WE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON THE RIVER WHICH MADE THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE
AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
COURAGE MY SISTER IT IS SOON OVER I FEAR NOTHING NOW CRIED YVONNE AND WENT ON TO TAKE HER PLACE IN THE CART
IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IN THE CONFUSION OF THE MOMENT YVONNE FOUND OPPORTUNITY TO READ AND DESTROY THE LITTLE PAPER WHICH SAID BRIEFLY WHEN YOU ARE FLUNG INTO THE RIVER CALL MY NAME AND FLOAT I SHALL BE NEAR
WHILE BLANCHETTE FLEW DOWN TO TELL YVONNE HE WAS COMING THE MOMENT THE DISTANT SPARK APPEARED HE BESTIRRED HIMSELF SET HIS TEETH AND BOLDLY BEGAN THE DANGEROUS DESCENT
HIS WILL WAS LAW YET IN SEEMING TO OBEY SHE OFTEN LED HIM AND HE THANKED HER FOR THE COURAGE WITH WHICH SHE HELPED HIM TO CONTROL HIS FIERY TEMPER AND STRONG WILL NOW
THAT HE MIGHT PROVE HIMSELF A MAN A BRAVE HIGH SPIRITED GENEROUS BOY WITH A VERY TENDER SPOT IN HIS HEART FOR THE GOOD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN A MOTHER TO HIM AND HIS LITTLE FOSTER SISTER WHOSE IDOL HE WAS
IT WAS DUSK BEFORE THE END CAME FOR YVONNE AND SHE WAS ALL UNNERVED BY THE SAD SIGHTS SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO SEE BUT WHEN RUDE HANDS SEIZED HER SHE MADE READY FOR THE PLUNGE SURE THAT GASTON WOULD BE NEAR
AND A BOAT READY TO RECEIVE THE FUGITIVES HER PLAN WAS PERILOUSLY SIMPLE BUT THE ONLY ONE POSSIBLE FOR GASTON WAS WELL GUARDED AND OUT OF THAT LOFTY CELL IT SEEMED THAT NO PRISONER COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT WINGS
ALONE IN HIS CELL HE RAGED LIKE A CAGED EAGLE FEELING THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THE FORT STOOD ON A PLATEAU OF PRECIPITOUS ROCK WASHED ON TWO SIDES BY THE SEA
AFTER SOME WEEKS OF THIS TERRIBLE LIFE HER NAME WAS CALLED ONE MORNING ON THE LIST FOR THAT DAY'S EXECUTION AND SHE ROSE TO JOIN THE SAD PROCESSION SETTING FORTH WHICH IS IT TO BE SHE ASKED
A FINE DAY FOR THE BLEACHING BUT OVER WARM FOR MUCH TRAVEL
TELL NO TALES OF THE TIME I LINGER
A CORD CAME UP AND WHEN THAT WAS FIRMLY SECURED A SECOND JERK WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT HAUL UP CAME THE STOUT ROPE KNOTTED HERE AND THERE TO ADD SAFETY AND STRENGTH TO THE HANDS AND FEET THAT WERE TO CLIMB DOWN THAT FRAIL LADDER
YVONNE WATCHED HIM TILL HE CLIMBED SAFELY IN AT THE HIGH WINDOW AND DISAPPEARED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND WHEN SHE TOO WENT BACK TO HER WORK LITTLE DREAMING WHAT BRAVE PARTS BOTH WERE TO PLAY IN DANGERS AND CAPTIVITIES
I AM LOST IF HE SPY ME FOR MY FATHER VOWED I SHOULD NOT HUNT AGAIN UNLESS I DID MY TASK HE WILL SEE ME IF I RUN
AS SHE GLANCED AT HIM SHE SAW THAT HE WAS ALREADY GROWING MORE TRANQUIL UNDER THE SOOTHING INFLUENCES OF THE MURMURING RIVER THE SOFT FLICKER OF THE SUNSHINE AND A BLESSED SENSE OF FREEDOM SO
AND NOT THAT OF A PEASANT ROUGH WITH HARD WORK SINCE I MAY NOT PLAY A MAN'S PART YET AMUSE ME LIKE A BOY
BROUGHT WORD THAT SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN HER FLIGHT AND SENT TO NANTES GASTON COULD NOT REST BUT DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A PEASANT
HE WAS FOR IN THE DARKNESS AND UPROAR
AND BLESSING YVONNE FOR THE KNOTS THAT KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHEN THE GUSTS BLEW HIM TO AND FRO MORE THAN ONCE HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER BUT THE GOOD ROPE HELD FAST AND STRENGTH AND COURAGE NERVED HEART AND LIMBS
AS WE SHALL SEE JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE SOUND OF HOOFS MADE THE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS START AND LOOK TOWARD THE ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY TO THE HILL
SINGING TO HERSELF AS SHE LEANED AGAINST A TREE WITH HER EARTHEN JUG IN HER HAND THE MULE PAUSED IN THE LIGHT SHADOW OF THE WILLOWS TO CROP A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS BEFORE CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE CHAPLAIN SEEMED GLAD TO REST A MOMENT
WHILE SHE TWISTED HER DISTAFF SHE TOLD THE STIRRING TALES OF WARRIORS SAINTS AND FAIRIES
AND THEY WERE AWAY TO THE BOAT THAT TOSSED ON THE WILD WATER WITH A SINGLE ROWER IN HIS PLACE
AS BABIES THE TWO SLEPT IN ONE CRADLE AS CHILDREN THEY PLAYED AND QUARRELLED TOGETHER AND AS BOY AND GIRL THEY DEFENDED COMFORTED AND AMUSED EACH OTHER
BLANCHETTE MEANTIME TRIPPED ABOUT THE CELL ON HER LITTLE ROSY FEET ATE A FEW CRUMBS OF THE HARD BREAD DIPPED HER BEAK IN THE JUG OF WATER DRESSED HER FEATHERS DAINTILY THEN FLEW TO THE BARS AND CALLED HIM
FOR SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH THEIR RAPID FLIGHT
HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WERE THERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY AND AMONG THEM WAS YVONNE BRAVE STILL BUT WITH NO HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR FEW WERE SAVED AND THEN ONLY BY SOME LUCKY ACCIDENT
WRUNG FROM HIM BY CAPTIVITY AND DESPAIR STANDING SO WITH EYES TOO DIM FOR SEEING SOMETHING BRUSHED AGAINST HIS HAIR AND A BIRD LIT ON THE NARROW LEDGE HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GULL AND PAID NO HEED
WHICH HAD SERVED MANY A FUGITIVE FOR A SHELTER AS THEY WENT
WE WILL ALWAYS STAND BY ONE ANOTHER AND BE TRUE TO THE MOTTO OF OUR HOUSE TILL DEATH
THE ROPE WAS MADE FAST TO AN IRON STAPLE INSIDE
I DO IT BUT ONE KNEE I BEND FOR MY GOD THE OTHER FOR MY KING
BUT DEARLY LOVED ATHLETIC SPORTS AND AT SIXTEEN RODE THE MOST FIERY HORSE WITHOUT A FALL HANDLED A SWORD ADMIRABLY COULD KILL A BOAR AT THE FIRST SHOT AND LONGED ARDENTLY FOR WAR
AND WITH A THRILL OF JOY LOOKED FOR THE TOKEN HARDLY DARING TO HOPE THAT ANY WOULD BE FOUND YES THERE TIED CAREFULLY AMONG THE WHITE FEATHERS WAS A TINY ROLL OF PAPER WITH THESE WORDS RUDELY WRITTEN ON IT
BUT GASTON WAS WELL TRAINED AND THE BOYISH PRANKS THAT USED TO BRING HIM INTO DIRE DISGRACE NOW HELPED TO SAVE HIS LIFE THUS WHEN THE ORDER CAME WRITTEN IN THE RUDE HAND HE HAD TAUGHT YVONNE LONG AGO
FINDING SAFETY IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE COUNTRY WHICH MADE FUGITIVES NO UNUSUAL SIGHT AND REFUGEES PLENTIFUL
BUT BEST OF ALL WAS THE TALE OF GASTON'S OWN ANCESTOR
BUT TIME BROUGHT INEVITABLE CHANGES AND BOTH FELT THAT THE HOUR OF SEPARATION WAS NEAR FOR
PAST WHICH THE GULLS FLEW SCREAMING AND WATCHED THE FISHERS AT THEIR WORK THE WOMEN GATHERING SEA WEED ON THE SHORE
AND WHILE SHE FLOATED HE CUT THE ROPE THEN SWAM DOWN THE RIVER WITH HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER TILL THEY DARED TO LAND BOTH WERE NEARLY SPENT WITH THE EXCITEMENT AND EXERTION OF THAT DREADFUL HOUR BUT HOEL WAITED
PULL UP THE THREAD WHICH BLANCHETTE WILL BRING AT MIDNIGHT WATCH FOR A LIGHT IN THE BAY THEN COME DOWN AND SAINT BARBE PROTECT YOU HE WAS READY FOR THE TINY FILE OF WATCH SPRING BROUGHT BY THE BIRD
LEAVING A MONTH OLD BOY GOOD DAME GILLIAN HAD TAKEN THE MOTHERLESS BABY AND NURSED AND REARED HIM WITH HER LITTLE GIRL SO FAITHFULLY AND TENDERLY
BUT IN A MOMENT A SOFT COO STARTED HIM AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A WHITE DOVE STRUGGLING TO GET IN BLANCHETTE HE CRIED AND THE PRETTY CREATURE FLEW TO HIS HAND
WILL YOU TALK OR SHALL I SING WHILE YOU REST THIS HOT HEAD AND DREAM OF HORSE AND HOUND AND SPEARING THE WILD BOAR ADDED YVONNE
SAID THE GIRL REVERENTLY TURNING THE PAGES OF THE BOOK SHE COULD NOT READ NO NEED OF THAT I LIKE YOU AS YOU ARE AND BY MY FAITH I DOUBT YOUR GREAT WILLINGNESS FOR WHEN I LAST PLAYED TUTOR
HER NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HER A POOR SOUL LEFT DESOLATE BY THE WAR AND LET HER LIVE UNMOLESTED SO SHE WORKED ON SECRETLY AND STEADILY PLAYING HER PART WELL
YVONNE WENT TO SPRINKLING THE NEGLECTED LINEN WONDERING WITH MINGLED ANXIETY AND GIRLISH MERRIMENT HOW GASTON FARED THE SUN SHONE HOTLY ON THE DRY CLOTH AND AS SHE APPROACHED THE BOY'S HIDING PLACE
WITH A HUNDRED ARMED VASSALS BEHIND THEM AND THE WHITE BANNER FLUTTERING ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN THE FRESH WIND SHE LONGED TO GO WITH HIM BUT HER PART WAS TO WATCH AND WAIT TO HOPE AND PRAY TILL THE HOUR CAME WHEN SHE LIKE MANY ANOTHER WOMAN IN THOSE DAYS
WHISPERED GASTON ASHAMED OF HIS PANIC YET UNWILLING TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS PRANK BUT QUICK WITTED YVONNE SAVED HIM FOR LIFTING ONE END OF THE LONG WEB OF LINEN SHE SHOWED A HOLLOW WHENCE SOME GREAT STONE HAD BEEN REMOVED
A LONG TALE FOR WHICH I HAVE A SHORT AND HAPPY ANSWER COME HOME TO SUPPER WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SIGHT THAT WILL GLADDEN HEARTS AND EYES HE ANSWERED SHOULDERING HIS LOAD AND LEADING THE WAY TO A DESERTED HERMITAGE
A SLIP OF PAPER WAS PRESSED INTO HER HAND
BUT YOU HE CRIED I CANNOT LEAVE YOU IN PERIL AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DARED AND DONE FOR ME NO ONE SUSPECTS ME I AM SAFE GO TO MY MOTHER SHE WILL HIDE YOU AND I WILL FOLLOW SOON
WAITING FOR NO FURTHER SPEECH
BE READY HELP WILL COME Y THE BRAVE GIRL THE LOYAL HEART I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN SHE WOULD KEEP HER PROMISE AND COME TO SAVE ME AND GASTON DROPPED ON HIS KNEES IN GRATITUDE
SO TOUCHED SO GLAD WAS HE TO FIND IN HIS DREARY PRISON EVEN A DUMB FRIEND AND COMFORTER BUT BLANCHETTE HAD HER PART TO PLAY
COULD PROVE HERSELF AS BRAVE AS A MAN AND FREELY RISK HER LIFE FOR THOSE SHE LOVED FOUR MONTHS LATER THE HEAVY TIDINGS REACHED THEM THAT THE OLD COUNT WAS KILLED AND GASTON TAKEN PRISONER
BURNED THE CHATEAU AND LAID WASTE THE ABBEY NOW MOTHER I MUST UP AND AWAY TO FIND AND RESCUE GASTON I PROMISED AND IF HE LIVES IT SHALL BE DONE LET ME GO YOU ARE SAFE NOW
I FOUND HIM LOOKING FOR YOU HE IS TRUE AS STEEL IN IN AND OFF OR YOU ARE LOST WHISPERED YVONNE FLINGING A CLOAK ABOUT GASTON THRUSTING A PURSE A SWORD AND A FLASK INTO HIS HAND AND HOLDING THE BOAT WHILE HE LEAPED IN
WHITHER THEY HAD HASTILY FLED FOR PROTECTION GO MY GIRL AND BRING ME NEWS OF OUR YOUNG LORD MAY YOU LEAD HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN TO RULE OVER US ANSWERED DAME GILLIAN DEVOTED STILL
MY PRETTY BIRDS THEN SWINGING HIMSELF OUT AS IF IT WERE NO NEW FEAT HE CLIMBED BOLDLY DOWN THROUGH THE IVY THAT HALF HID THE CARVED FLOWERS AND FIGURES WHICH MADE A LADDER FOR HIS AGILE FEET
CROWDED WITH UNFORTUNATE AND INNOCENT CREATURES ARRESTED ON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXTS
THE MOMENT HE DISAPPEARED A SMALL EARTHQUAKE SEEMED TO TAKE PLACE UNDER THE LINEN FOR IT FLEW UP VIOLENTLY AND A PAIR OF LONG LEGS WAVED JOYFULLY IN THE AIR AS GASTON BURST INTO A RINGING LAUGH
HAD FATHER NEVIN TRUSTED TO MY HONOR I WOULD NOT HAVE RUN AWAY BUT HE LOCKED ME IN LIKE A MONK IN A CELL AND THAT I WILL NOT BEAR JUST ONE HOUR YVONNE ONE LITTLE HOUR OF FREEDOM
HE KNEW WHAT TO DO AND TYING A BIT OF THE BROKEN BAR TO ONE END AS A WEIGHT HE LET IT DOWN PRAYING THAT NO CRUEL GUST WOULD BREAK OR BLOW IT AWAY IN A MOMENT A QUICK JERK AT THE THREAD BADE HIM PULL AGAIN
HE HAD NOTHING TO SEND BACK BY THIS SURE MESSENGER BUT A LOCK OF HAIR AND THIS HE TIED WITH THE SAME THREAD IN PLACE OF THE NOTE THEN KISSING THE BIRD HE BADE IT GO
I AM HERE IT WAS GASTON IN THE MIDST OF ENEMIES BENT ON SAVING HER AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE REMEMBERING ALL HE OWED HER AND THE MOTTO OF HIS RACE THE SHOCK OF THIS DISCOVERY NEARLY BETRAYED THEM BOTH
SHE EMPLOYED EVERY MOMENT IN LOOSENING THE ROPE THAT TIED HER HANDS AND KEEPING HER EYE ON THE TALL BEARDED MAN WHO MOVED ABOUT SEEMING TO DO HIS WORK WHILE HIS BLOOD BOILED WITH SUPPRESSED WRATH AND HIS HEART ACHED WITH UNAVAILING PITY
AND WATCHED IT VANISH IN THE DARKNESS THEN WENT AWAY TO GIVE THANKS AND REST AFTER HER LONG WORK AND EXCITEMENT
LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY SHE WENT AMONG THE POOR SOULS CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE GREAT HALLS HUNGRY COLD SICK AND DESPAIRING AND THEY CLUNG TO HER AS IF SHE WERE SOME STRONG SWEET SAINT WHO COULD DELIVER THEM OR TEACH THEM HOW TO DIE
AND THE THIRST WILL PASS QUOTED YVONNE TAKING A NAUGHTY SATISFACTION IN THE IGNOMINIOUS CAPTIVITY OF THE WILFUL BOY A LONG SIGH WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HE GAVE AND TAKING PITY ON HIM
FOR DAYS HE SEEMED TO FORGET THESE HUMBLE FRIENDS AND LED THE GAY ACTIVE LIFE OF HIS AGE AND RANK BUT IF WOUNDED IN THE CHASE WORRIED BY THE CHAPLAIN DISAPPOINTED IN ANY PLAN OR IN DISGRACE FOR ANY PRANK
AND GASTON SLIPPED INTO THE GREEN NEST
AND AFTER WEEKS OF CONCEALMENT SUFFERING AND ANXIETY HAD BROUGHT HIM SO FAR TOWARD HOME NO NEED TO TELL OF THE HAPPY MEETING THAT NIGHT NOR OF THE GLAD RETURN FOR THOUGH THE CHATEAU WAS IN RUINS AND LIVES WERE STILL IN DANGER
WHILE SHE SAT BESIDE HIM RACKING HER BRAIN FOR TALES TO BEGUILE THIS TRUANT HOUR HER FATHER WAS THE COUNT'S FORESTER AND WHEN THE COUNTESS HAD DIED SOME SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE
THE JAILER WENT HIS LAST ROUND THE GREAT BELL STRUCK THE APPOINTED HOUR AND GASTON STOOD AT THE WINDOW STRAINING HIS EYES TO CATCH THE FIRST RAY OF THE PROMISED LIGHT WHEN THE SOFT WHIR OF WINGS GLADDENED HIS EAR AND BLANCHETTE ARRIVED
AS SHE PASSED ONE OF THE MEN WHO GUARDED THEM A ROUGH FELLOW WHOSE FACE WAS HALF HIDDEN BY A SHAGGY BEARD YOU WILL BE DROWNED WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE ON WOMEN
REACHED HOME SAFELY AND DAME GILLIAN CONCEALED HIM IN THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY TILL ANXIETY FOR YVONNE DROVE HIM OUT TO SEEK AND RESCUE IN HIS TURN FOR SHE DID NOT COME AND WHEN A RETURNING SOLDIER
NOT TO HUNT YOUR FELLOW CREATURES MY LORD BUT I FORGIVE YOU FOR IT WAS WELL DONE AND I HAD A HARD RUN TO ESCAPE HE SAID STILL LAUGHING BUT HOW CAME YOU HERE CRIED BOTH THE YOUTHS IN GREAT EXCITEMENT FOR THE GOOD MAN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD
HE HAD HEARD OF THE MASSACRE OF THE ROYALIST EMIGRANTS WHO LANDED THERE AND TRIED TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR A LIKE FATE
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED BY A ROSY BROWN EYED LASS WHOSE WHITE TEETH SHONE AS SHE LAUGHED TO SEE HIM LEAP THE MOAT DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND COME BOUNDING TOWARD HER HIS HAIR STREAMING IN THE WIND
THE CHAPLAIN LOOKED UP BUT THE GIRL COUGHED LOUDLY AS SHE WENT TO REFILL HER JUG WITH SUCH A DEMURE FACE THAT HE SUSPECTED NOTHING
WHICH YVONNE ECHOED HEARTILY THEN SPRINGING UP HE SAID THROWING BACK HIS WET HAIR AND SHAKING HIS FINGER AT HER YOU DARED NOT BETRAY ME BUT YOU NEARLY DROWNED ME WICKED GIRL
AND LEFT YOU TO SPELL OUT THE PRETTY LEGEND OF SAINT COVENTIN AND HIS LITTLE FISH I FOUND YOU FAST ASLEEP WITH THE BLESSED BOOK UPON THE FLOOR LAUGHED GASTON TURNING THE TABLES ON HIS MENTOR WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
WHO WAS BOTH HER PRINCE AND BROTHER HER INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS GREAT FOR SHE WAS OF A CALM AND PATIENT NATURE AS WELL AS
HAD SECRETLY DONE ITS WORK AND SEVERAL BARS WERE LOOSE HE KNEW THAT THE ATTEMPT MIGHT COST HIM HIS LIFE BUT WAS WILLING TO GAIN LIBERTY EVEN AT THAT PRICE FOR IMPRISONMENT SEEMED WORSE THAN DEATH TO HIS IMPATIENT SPIRIT
THEN I WILL GO BACK ELSE THERE WILL BE NO SPORT FOR ME TO MORROW SAID THE LAD RECKLESSLY PULLING UP THE BLUETS THAT STARRED THE GRASS ABOUT HIM
AND NURSED HER MASTER BACK TO HEALTH
SHE MADE A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE LINEN WHERE SHE KNEW HIS HEAD LAY
LET ME THINK A BIT TILL I REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITES AND DO YOU LISTEN TO THE BEES ABOVE THERE IN THE WILLOW SETTING YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE IDLE BOY
AND HIS FATHER TAUGHT HIM HORSEMANSHIP AND THE USE OF ARMS ACCOMPLISHMENTS CONSIDERED ALL IMPORTANT IN THOSE DAYS
WHO LOVED YVONNE AND WOULD GLADLY DIE FOR HER AND HIS YOUNG MASTER THEIR HEARTS SUNK WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS IN THE BOUFFLAY AN OLD FORTRESS ONCE A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND NOW A PRISON
AND GASTON WENT TO THE WARS AGAIN A NEW CHATEAU ROSE ON THE RUINS OF THE OLD
SHE UNDERSTOOD
FOR THE OLD COUNT HAD BEEN AN OFFICER OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD AND HASTENED TO PROVE HIS LOYALTY YVONNE'S HEART BEAT HIGH WITH PRIDE AS SHE SAW HER FOSTER BROTHER RIDE GALLANTLY AWAY BESIDE HIS FATHER
AFTER BEING OFTEN MISLED BY FALSE RUMORS
YET SHE LET HER DAUGHTER GO WITHOUT A MURMUR FEELING THAT NO SACRIFICE WAS TOO GREAT SO YVONNE SET OUT
AND HIS FACE FULL OF BOYISH SATISFACTION IN THIS ESCAPADE THE OLD TALE HE PANTED AS HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN UPON THE GRASS AND FLUNG THE RECOVERED BOOK BESIDE HIM
OF WHICH THESE YOUTHFUL PRANKS AND PERILS WERE BUT A FORESHADOWING TWO YEARS LATER IN THE MONTH OF MARCH SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
AND A QUILL FROM BLANCHETTE'S WING HE THUS LEARNED HOW YVONNE WAS LIVING IN A FISHER'S HUT ON THE BEACH AND WORKING FOR HIS RESCUE AS WELL AS SHE DARED
THE GIRL LAUGHED ALSO AS SHE RETORTED MY TUTOR SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT ME TO PLAY WITH HIS DOGS I BORE MY PENANCE BETTER THAN YOU AND DID NOT RUN AWAY COME NOW WE'LL BE MERRY
SAID THE OLD MAN WHEN HE HAD DRUNK AND WITH A FROWNING GLANCE AT THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS PRISONER HE DREW A BREVIARY FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN TO READ WHILE THE MULE BROWSED ALONG THE ROAD SIDE
THE TWO YOUNG MEN WENT TO FIND FOOD LEAVING YVONNE TO TEND THE FIRE AND MAKE READY TO COOK THE VENISON THEY HOPED TO BRING IT WAS NIGHTFALL AND ANOTHER DAY WOULD SEE THEM IN DINAN THEY HOPED BUT THE LADS HAD CONSENTED TO PAUSE FOR THE GIRL'S SAKE
A STIR WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM HAD THE CHAPLAIN'S EYES BEEN LIFTED SPRINKLE ME QUICKLY I AM STIFLING IN THIS HOLE WHISPERED AN IMPLORING VOICE
LOOKING SCARED AND WET AND WEARY FOR RAIN FELL THE WIND BLEW FITFULLY
HIS OWN RECKLESS COURAGE HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE FOR IN ONE OF THE MANY SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN PART HE VENTURED TOO FAR AWAY FROM HIS MEN AND WAS CAPTURED AFTER FIGHTING DESPERATELY TO CUT HIS WAY OUT NOW
A BIRD AND A WOMAN LENT HIM THOSE WINGS AND HIS DARING FLIGHT WAS A NINE DAYS WONDER AT THE FORT
HERE'S A FINE PRETEXT FOR ESCAPE BEING LOCKED IN
BITTERLY DID HE REGRET THE WILFULNESS WHICH BROUGHT HIM THERE WELL KNOWING THAT IF HE HAD OBEYED ORDERS HE WOULD NOW BE FREE TO FIND HIS FATHER'S BODY AND AVENGE HIS DEATH OH FOR ONE DAY OF LIBERTY
PECKING AT HIS LIPS IN THE OLD CARESSING WAY HE KNEW SO WELL MY FAITHFUL BIRD GOD BLESS THEE EXCLAIMED THE POOR LAD
HE TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO DAME GILLIAN AND YVONNE SURE OF HELP AND COMFORT FOR MIND AND BODY COMPANIONSHIP WITH HIM HAD REFINED THE GIRL AND GIVEN HER GLIMPSES OF A WORLD INTO WHICH SHE COULD NEVER ENTER
BUT OBEDIENT TO ITS TRAINING IT FLEW TO ITS MASTER
AND POINTING TO THE FIGURE OF A MAN WITH A PALE FACE AND BANDAGED HEAD LYING ASLEEP BESIDE THE FIRE IT WAS THE COUNT SORELY WOUNDED BUT ALIVE THANKS TO HIS DEVOTED FOLLOWER WHO HAD SAVED HIM WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER
FOR THE DAY WAS WARM AND THE ROAD DUSTY COME HITHER CHILD AND GIVE ME A DRAUGHT OF WATER HE CALLED AND THE GIRL RAN TO FILL HER PITCHER OFFERING IT WITH A LOW REVERENCE THANKS DAUGHTER
AND THERE IS NO REST FOR ME TILL I KNOW HOW HE FARES SAID YVONNE
AND THAT A HAPPY ONE COMPLETED THEIR JOY AND TURNED THEIR FLIGHT INTO A TRIUMPHANT MARCH PAUSING IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT FOREST OF HUNAUDAYE TO REST
THE PRETTY WINGED CREATURE FRIGHTENED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS HOME HAD FLOWN TO HER FOR REFUGE AND SHE HAD CHERISHED IT FOR ITS MASTER'S SAKE NOW WHEN IT WOULD NOT LEAVE HER BUT CAME CIRCLING AROUND HER HEAD A LEAGUE AWAY FROM DINAN
AND PRESENTLY FLUTTERED BACK TO THE WINDOW LEDGE COOING LOUDLY AS SHE PECKED AT SOMETHING UNDERNEATH HER WING THEN GASTON REMEMBERED
CARRYING JOY WITH IT AND LEAVING HOPE BEHIND AFTER THAT THE LITTLE COURIER CAME OFTEN UNPERCEIVED CARRYING LETTERS TO AND FRO FOR YVONNE SENT BITS OF PAPER AND GASTON WROTE HIS ANSWERS WITH HIS BLOOD
IT IS LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD ONE
I CANNOT STOP FOR VENGEANCE NOW BUT I'LL TOSS YOU INTO THE RIVER SOME DAY AND LEAVE YOU TO GET OUT AS YOU CAN THEN HE WAS OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE CAME EAGER TO REACH HIS PRISON AGAIN BEFORE THE CHAPLAIN CAME TO HEAR THE UNLEARNED LESSON
AND SHE WAS SOON ABLE TO REJOICE WITH THE BRAVE FELLOWS OVER THIS ESCAPE SO AUDACIOUSLY PLANNED AND SO BOLDLY CARRIED OUT THEY DARED STAY BUT A FEW HOURS AND BEFORE DAWN WERE HASTENING THROUGH THE LEAST FREQUENTED WAYS TOWARD HOME
GREAT WAS THE LAMENTATION AMONG THE OLD MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND BUT THEY HAD LITTLE TIME FOR SORROW
THIS DREARY LATIN DRIVES ME MAD AND I WILL NOT WASTE SUCH DAYS AS THIS PORING OVER DULL PAGES LIKE A PRIEST WHEN I SHOULD BE HUNTING LIKE A KNIGHT AND GENTLEMAN
RAIN BLINDED HIM THE WIND BEAT HIM AGAINST THE ROCK BRUISING HANDS AND KNEES
SHE ACCEPTED THE GOOD OMEN AND MADE THE BIRD THE COMPANION OF HER PERILOUS JOURNEY THERE IS NO ROOM TO TELL ALL THE DANGERS DISAPPOINTMENTS AND FATIGUES ENDURED BEFORE SHE FOUND GASTON BUT
AND POINTED TO A GREEN SLOPE BEFORE THEM AN EARLY MOON GAVE LIGHT ENOUGH TO SHOW THEM A DARK FORM MOVING QUICKLY INTO THE COPPICE AND SOMETHING LIKE THE ANTLERS OF A STAG SHOWED ABOVE THE TALL BRAKES BEFORE THEY VANISHED
GASTON WAS RECEIVING THE EDUCATION BEFITTING A YOUNG COUNT THE CHAPLAIN TAUGHT HIM TO READ AND WRITE WITH LESSONS IN SACRED HISTORY AND A LITTLE LATIN OF THE FORESTER HE LEARNED WOODCRAFT
ON CAME THE CHAPLAIN GLANCING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM BEING OF AN AUSTERE AND SUSPICIOUS NATURE HE SAW NOTHING HOWEVER BUT THE PEASANT GIRL IN HER QUAINT CAP AND WOODEN SABOTS
ONE GREATER THAN SAINT BARBE UPHELD HIM AND HE DROPPED AT LAST BREATHLESS AND BLEEDING BESIDE THE FAITHFUL YVONNE THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WORDS ONLY A GRASP OF THE HAND A SIGH OF GRATITUDE
AS HE SPOKE HE SHOOK THE HEAVY BARS WITH IMPOTENT STRENGTH
WAS ALL THEY SAW BUT THE CHANGE THAT CAME OVER BOTH WAS COMICAL IN ITS SUDDENNESS FOR THE GALLANT KNIGHT TURNED TO A TRUANT SCHOOL BOY DAUNTED BY THE SIGHT OF HIS TUTOR WHILE THE RIVAL OF THE MAID OF ORLEANS GREW PALE WITH DISMAY
WHERE THEY GAVE HER FIRE FOOD DRY GARMENTS AND THE GLADDEST WELCOME ONE HUMAN CREATURE EVER GAVE TO ANOTHER BEING A ROBUST PEASANT THE GIRL CAME SAFELY THROUGH HARDSHIPS THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED OR CRAZED A FRAILER CREATURE
PRUDENCE RANG THE PIANO WAS SILENT A WOMAN WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A COMPANION THAN A SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR WE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND FROM THAT TO THE BOUDOIR WHICH WAS THEN JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT SINCE
POOR MARGUERITE SAID GASTON SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO AND PLAYING A WALTZ I HADN'T A NOTION OF IT BUT I DID NOTICE SHE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING SO GAY LATELY HUSH SAID PRUDENCE LISTENING GASTON STOPPED
WE SPEND MOST OF OUR EVENING TOGETHER OR SHE CALLS TO ME WHEN SHE COMES IN SHE NEVER GOES TO BED BEFORE TWO IN THE MORNING SHE CAN'T SLEEP BEFORE THAT WHY BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS IN THE CHEST AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS FEVERISH
BECAUSE THE COMTE DE N IS STILL HERE AND HE IS BORING ME TO DEATH I CAN'T NOW WHAT IS HINDERING YOU THERE ARE TWO YOUNG FELLOWS HERE WHO WON'T GO
AT THE DOOR PRUDENCE ASKED US TO COME UP AND SEE HER SHOWROOMS WHICH WE HAD NEVER SEEN AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED VERY PROUD YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EAGERLY I ACCEPTED IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I WAS COMING NEARER AND NEARER TO MARGUERITE
WHILE THIS OLD DUKE MIGHT DIE ANY DAY OLD MEN ARE EGOISTS HIS FAMILY ARE ALWAYS REPROACHING HIM FOR HIS AFFECTION FOR MARGUERITE THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY HE IS LIKELY TO LEAVE HER NOTHING I GIVE HER GOOD ADVICE
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU FOR TEN MINUTES SAID MARGUERITE FROM HER WINDOW IN ALMOST AN IMPERIOUS TONE OF VOICE WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT YOU TO COME OVER AT ONCE WHY
I WENT BACK TO GASTON AND TOLD HIM OF THE ARRANGEMENT I HAD MADE FOR HIM AND FOR ME HE AGREED
THAT THEN I CONTINUED IS WHY SHE IS ALONE HERE PRECISELY BUT WHO WILL SEE HER HOME HE WILL
PRESENTLY I SAW HER GLANCING ACROSS AT THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE OPPOSITE BOX ON LOOKING I SAW A WOMAN WITH WHOM I WAS QUITE FAMILIAR SHE HAD ONCE BEEN A KEPT WOMAN AND HAD TRIED TO GO ON THE STAGE HAD FAILED
I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CORRIDOR AND I RETURNED TO MY PLACE IN THE STALLS LOOKING HASTILY AROUND TO SEE WHAT BOX SHE WAS IN SHE WAS IN A GROUND FLOOR BOX QUITE ALONE SHE HAD CHANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US
AND PROFITED BY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE LOOKED MY WAY TO WAVE MY HAND TO HER AS I EXPECTED SHE BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER BOX PRUDENCE DUVERNOY THAT WAS THE MILLINER'S AUSPICIOUS NAME
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED YOU KNOW ONE
CHAPTER EIGHT HOWEVER CONTINUED ARMAND AFTER A PAUSE WHILE I KNEW MYSELF TO BE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER I FELT MORE SURE OF MYSELF AND PART OF MY DESIRE TO SPEAK TO MARGUERITE AGAIN
AND SHE ONLY SAYS IT WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO TAKE ON THE COUNT WHEN THE DUKE IS DEAD IT ISN'T ALL FUN CONTINUED PRUDENCE TO LIVE LIKE THAT I KNOW VERY WELL IT WOULDN'T SUIT ME AND I SHOULD SOON SEND THE OLD MAN ABOUT HIS BUSINESS HE IS SO DULL
I GAZED AT HER SO FIXEDLY THAT MY EYES ATTRACTED HERS SHE LOOKED AT ME FOR A FEW SECONDS PUT UP HER OPERA GLASS TO SEE ME BETTER AND SEEMED TO THINK SHE RECOGNISED ME WITHOUT BEING QUITE SURE WHO I WAS
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND A CHARMING FELLOW VERY AMUSING HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WELL ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO AFTER THIS PIECE IS OVER FOR I KNOW THE LAST PIECE WITH PLEASURE
AND WAS GIVING HER A BAG OF SWEETS INTO WHICH SHE DIPPED AT ONCE SMILING THEN SHE HELD IT OUT TOWARD PRUDENCE WITH A GESTURE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY WILL YOU HAVE SOME NO SIGNALLED PRUDENCE
WAS ONE OF THOSE FAT WOMEN OF FORTY WITH WHOM ONE REQUIRES VERY LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW IS AS SIMPLE AS WHAT I HAD TO ASK OF HER
AH THAT IS YOUR IDEA OF HOSPITALITY SAID GASTON LAUGHING WE WON'T GO TILL WE PLEASE WHY SHOULD WE GO I AM GOING OVER TO MARGUERITE'S WE WILL WAIT HERE YOU CAN'T
THE MAN EMBARRASSED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS NULLITY THE WOMAN TIRED OF HER DISMAL VISITOR
HASN'T SHE ANY LOVERS I ASKED I NEVER SEE ANY ONE REMAIN AFTER I LEAVE I DON'T SAY NO ONE EVER COMES WHEN I AM GONE OFTEN IN THE EVENING I MEET THERE A CERTAIN COMTE DE N
WE AGAIN HEARD MARGUERITE'S VOICE CALLING TO PRUDENCE WHO RUSHED TO HER DRESSING ROOM WINDOW I FOLLOWED WITH GASTON AS SHE OPENED THE WINDOW WE HID OURSELVES SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
I NEVER SAW HER PAY THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS BEING ACTED AS FOR ME THE PERFORMANCE INTERESTED ME EQUALLY LITTLE AND I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BUT HER THOUGH DOING MY UTMOST TO KEEP HER FROM NOTICING IT
THEN WE WILL GO WITH YOU THAT STILL LESS I KNOW MARGUERITE SAID GASTON I CAN VERY WELL PAY HER A CALL BUT ARMAND DOESN'T KNOW HER I WILL INTRODUCE HIM IMPOSSIBLE
YES PROTECTION REPLIED PRUDENCE POOR OLD MAN HE WOULD BE GREATLY EMBARRASSED TO OFFER HER ANYTHING ELSE PRUDENCE THEN TOLD ME HOW MARGUERITE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DUKE AT BAGNERES
WAS A WISH TO MAKE HER SEE THAT I WAS STRONGER THAN SHE HOW MANY WAYS DOES THE HEART TAKE HOW MANY REASONS DOES IT INVENT FOR ITSELF IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IT WANTS
I WAS STILL MORE AGITATED THAN ON THE EVENING WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED IN THE BOX AT THE OPERA COMIQUE AS WE REACHED THE DOOR THAT YOU KNOW MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO THINK WE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PIANO
AND RELYING ON HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH FASHIONABLE PEOPLE IN PARIS HAD GONE INTO BUSINESS AND TAKEN A MILLINER'S SHOP I SAW IN HER A MEANS OF MEETING WITH MARGUERITE
A YOUNG MAN WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE MARGUERITE SEATED AT THE PIANO LET HER FINGERS WANDER OVER THE NOTES BEGINNING SCRAPS OF MUSIC WITHOUT FINISHING THEM THE WHOLE SCENE BREATHED BOREDOM
HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH
AND YOU WHO IS SEEING YOU HOME NO ONE MAY I OFFER MYSELF BUT YOU ARE WITH A FRIEND ARE YOU NOT
FOR WHEN SHE PUT DOWN HER GLASSES A SMILE THAT CHARMING FEMININE SALUTATION FLITTED ACROSS HER LIPS AS IF TO ANSWER THE BOW WHICH SHE SEEMED TO EXPECT BUT I DID NOT RESPOND
THE WINDOW OF HER DRESSING ROOM LOOKS ON TO THE WINDOW OF MINE THEY SAY SHE IS A CHARMING GIRL DON'T YOU KNOW HER NO BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SHALL I ASK HER TO COME OVER TO OUR BOX NO
I WOULD RATHER FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT HER OWN HOUSE YES THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT WHY BECAUSE SHE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A JEALOUS OLD DUKE PROTECTION IS CHARMING
DELIGHTED ISN'T THE WORD
MY DEAR CHILD THERE'S THE MAN FOR YOU SHE WHO GENERALLY LISTENS TO ME TURNS HER BACK AND REPLIES THAT HE IS TOO STUPID STUPID INDEED HE IS BUT IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER
TRY TO BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN HE IS OR I KNOW MARGUERITE SHE WILL PUT IT ALL DOWN TO ME WE FOLLOWED PRUDENCE DOWNSTAIRS I TREMBLED IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS VISIT WAS TO HAVE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE
I SOON TURNED THE CONVERSATION IN HER DIRECTION THE OLD DUKE IS AT YOUR NEIGHBOURS I SAID TO PRUDENCE OH NO SHE IS PROBABLY ALONE BUT SHE MUST BE DREADFULLY BORED SAID GASTON
I HAVE TOLD THEM WELL THEN LEAVE THEM IN THE HOUSE THEY WILL SOON GO WHEN THEY SEE YOU HAVE GONE THEY WILL TURN EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN BUT WHAT DO THEY WANT THEY WANT TO SEE YOU
AND NO LONGER WORE AN INDIFFERENT SMILE ON HER LIPS SHE HAD SUFFERED SHE WAS STILL SUFFERING THOUGH IT WAS APRIL SHE WAS STILL WEARING A WINTER COSTUME ALL WRAPPED UP IN FURS
MARGUERITE DREW BACK THE BAG AND TURNING BEGAN TO TALK WITH THE DUKE IT MAY SOUND CHILDISH TO TELL YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT EVERYTHING RELATING TO MARGUERITE IS SO FRESH IN MY MEMORY THAT I CAN NOT HELP RECALLING THEM NOW
SO AS TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER HER AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE SHE REMEMBERED SUPPOSING HERSELF MISTAKEN SHE LOOKED AWAY THE CURTAIN WENT UP I HAVE OFTEN SEEN MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE
I WILL GO AND TELL MY FRIEND GO THEN AH ADDED PRUDENCE AS I WAS GOING THERE IS THE DUKE JUST COMING INTO MARGUERITE'S BOX I LOOKED AT HIM A MAN OF ABOUT SEVENTY HAD SAT DOWN BEHIND HER
WHEN THEY WERE ON THE STREET HE HANDED HER INTO A PHAETON WHICH HE DROVE HIMSELF AND THEY WERE WHIRLED AWAY BY TWO SUPERB HORSES WE RETURNED TO PRUDENCE'S BOX AND WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HIM NO BUT BRING THEM ALONG ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THE COUNT I EXPECT YOU COME AT ONCE MARGUERITE CLOSED HER WINDOW AND PRUDENCE HERS
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SMILING ACROSS AT MARGUERITE TO ASK HER WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING AT MARGUERITE GAUTIER YOU KNOW HER YES I AM HER MILLINER AND SHE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE
SHE IS CALLING ME I THINK WE LISTENED A VOICE WAS CALLING PRUDENCE COME NOW YOU MUST GO
WE HAD SCARCELY OPENED THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE STALLS WHEN WE HAD TO STAND ASIDE TO ALLOW MARGUERITE AND THE DUKE TO PASS I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE TO HAVE BEEN IN THE OLD MAN'S PLACE
WHO THINKS HE IS MAKING SOME HEADWAY BY CALLING ON HER AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING AND BY SENDING HER JEWELS TO ANY EXTENT BUT SHE CAN'T STAND HIM SHE MAKES A MISTAKE HE IS VERY RICH IT IS IN VAIN THAT I SAY TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME
AS HE READ THESE WORDS WHICH AS HE SAID WERE ENDORSED UPON THE OUTER SHEET OF PAPER WHICH SERVED AS A COVER FOR THE LETTERS WHICH WERE ENCLOSED WITHIN HIS FACE BECAME TRANSFIGURED NEVER DID I SUPPOSE THAT RAGE COULD HAVE SO POSSESSED A HUMAN COUNTENANCE
AND WHICH YOU USED THE ARTS IN WHICH A THIEF IS SKILLED TO ENTER GIVE IT TO ME THIEF HE SNATCHED THE PACKET FROM ME SCRATCHING THE BACK OF MY HAND AS HE DID SO AS IF HIS NAILS HAD BEEN TALONS
YOU ARE SMALL BUT HE IS SMALLER YOUR GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM
TO HAVE BECOME A TRIFLE SMUDGED AS USUAL THE MAN IN THE BED SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY IN DECIPHERING WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH MY MIND THAT IS SO YOU AND HE YOU ARE A PAIR
IS IT NOT SWEET TO STAND CLOSE AT MY SIDE YOU WITH YOUR WHITE SKIN IF I WERE A WOMAN WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME FOR A WIFE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS WAS SAID WHICH WAS SO ESSENTIALLY FEMININE
THAT ONCE MORE I WONDERED IF I COULD POSSIBLY BE MISTAKEN IN THE CREATURE'S SEX I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE HIM ACROSS THE FACE OR BETTER TO HAVE TAKEN HIM BY THE NECK AND THROWN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW AND ROLLED HIM IN THE MUD
AS IF TO GIVE ME TIME TO DIGEST HIS GIBE YOU SAW PAUL LESSINGHAM WELL THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM WAS HE THEN SO GREAT
HE SET HIMSELF TO PLAY WITH IT IGNORING MY OUTSTRETCHED HAND HE STARED ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WHAT AILS YOU
HE CONDESCENDED TO NOTICE WHAT I WAS HOLDING OUT TO HIM SO THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM THE DRAWER IN THE BUREAU THE DRAWER WHICH WAS LOCKED
TO STINK UNDER THE BLOOD GRIMED SUN
SO THAT IS WHAT HIS DEAR LOVE HAS FOUND IT IN HER HEART TO WRITE PAUL LESSINGHAM PAUL LESSINGHAM PEN CANNOT DESCRIBE THE CONCENTRATED FRENZY OF HATRED WITH WHICH THE SPEAKER DWELT UPON THE NAME
HE TURNED THE PACKET OVER AND OVER GLARING AT IT AS HE DID SO IT WAS STRANGE WHAT A RELIEF IT WAS TO HAVE HIS GLANCE REMOVED FROM OFF MY FACE YOU KEPT IT IN YOUR INNER DRAWER PAUL LESSINGHAM
HIS JAW DROPPED OPEN SO THAT HIS YELLOW FANGS GLEAMED THOUGH HIS PARTED LIPS HE HELD HIS BREATH SO LONG THAT EACH MOMENT I LOOKED TO SEE HIM FALL DOWN IN A FIT THE VEINS STOOD OUT ALL OVER HIS FACE AND HEAD LIKE SEAMS OF BLOOD
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH HIS UNPITYING UNBLINKING GLANCE SO THROUGH THE WINDOW AGAIN LIKE A THIEF IS IT ALWAYS THROUGH THAT DOOR THAT YOU COME INTO A HOUSE HE PAUSED
HE DEVOURED THEM WITH EQUAL APPETITE EACH ONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL I THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE RE READING THEM THEY WERE ON THICK WHITE PAPER OF A PECULIAR SHADE OF WHITENESS WITH UNTRIMMED EDGES
HE LEAPED SHRIEKING OFF THE BED AND SPRANG AT ME CLASPING MY THROAT WITH HIS HORRID HANDS BEARING ME BACKWARDS ON TO THE FLOOR I FELT HIS BREATH MINGLE WITH MINE
SWEET MARJORIE HIS DEAR LOVE PAUL LESSINGHAM'S DEAR LOVE SHE WITH THE LILY FACE THE CORN HUED HAIR WHAT IS IT HIS DEAR LOVE HAS FOUND IN HER FOND HEART TO WRITE PAUL LESSINGHAM
IT SHALL BE IT SHALL BE IT IS I THAT SAY IT EVEN I IN THE MADNESS OF HIS RHAPSODICAL FRENZY I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN I WAS THERE BUT ON A SUDDEN GLANCING ASIDE
THE LETTERS OF HIS DEAR LOVE OF HIS DEAR LOVE HIS PAUL LESSINGHAM'S SO IT IS AS I GUESSED AS I KNEW AS I SAW MARJORIE LINDON
REMINDED ME IN SOME UNCOMFORTABLE WAY OF A RUSTY SAW THE THINGS HE SAID AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SAID THEM WERE ALIKE INTENDED TO ADD TO MY DISCOMFORT IT WAS SOLELY BECAUSE THE FEAT WAS BARELY POSSIBLE
I KNOW NOT HOW LONG HE CONTINUED SPEECHLESS WHEN HIS BREATH RETURNED IT WAS WITH CHOKINGS AND GASPINGS IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HE HISSED OUT HIS WORDS AS IF THEIR MERE PASSAGE THROUGH HIS THROAT BROUGHT HIM NEAR TO STRANGULATION
HE KEPT EMITTING SOUNDS MORE RESEMBLING YELPS AND SNARLS THAN ANYTHING MORE HUMAN LIKE SOME SAVAGE BEAST NURSING ITS PENT UP RAGE WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF READING FOR THE SEASON HE LET HIS PASSION HAVE FULL VENT
ON EACH SHEET A CREST AND AN ADDRESS WERE STAMPED IN GOLD AND ALL THE SHEETS WERE OF THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME I SAW WRITING PAPER LIKE THAT AGAIN
GIVE ME WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN I MOVED TOWARDS THE BED MOST UNWILLINGLY AND HELD OUT TO HIM THE PACKET OF LETTERS WHICH I HAD ABSTRACTED FROM THE LITTLE DRAWER PERCEIVING MY DISINCLINATION TO HIS NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD
SITTING UP IN BED HE TORE THE PACKET OPEN IT CONTAINED PERHAPS EIGHT OR NINE LETTERS SOME MERE NOTES SOME LONG EPISTLES BUT SHORT OR LONG
THAT HE ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED LIKE A THIEF YOU WENT INTO HIS HOUSE DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE A THIEF HE FOUND YOU WERE YOU NOT ASHAMED SINCE LIKE A THIEF HE FOUND YOU HOW COMES IT THAT YOU HAVE ESCAPED
FOR MARJORIE LINDON FOR HIS DEAR LOVE IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT SHE SHALL WISH THAT SHE WAS NEVER BORN NOR HE AND THE GODS OF THE SHADOWS SHALL SMELL THE SWEET INCENSE OF HER SUFFERING
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED YOURS WERE SUCH AGILE FINGERS SO AN ENDORSEMENT ON THE COVER WHAT'S THIS LET'S SEE WHAT'S WRITTEN THE LETTERS OF MY DEAR LOVE MARJORIE LINDON
BY WHAT ROBBER'S ARTIFICE HAVE YOU SAVED YOURSELF FROM G A O L HIS MANNER CHANGED SO THAT ALL AT ONCE HE SEEMED TO SNARL AT ME
HE SAW ME AND REMEMBERED AND WAS PROMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO WREAK HIS RAGE UPON A TANGIBLE OBJECT IT IS YOU YOU THIEF YOU STILL LIVE TO MAKE A MOCK OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS
HE SHALL BE GROUND BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE NETHER STONES IN THE TOWERS OF ANGUISH
THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM IS AS GREAT A THIEF AS YOU AND GREATER FOR AT LEAST THAN YOU HE HAS MORE COURAGE FOR SOME MOMENTS HE WAS STILL THEN EXCLAIMED WITH SUDDEN FIERCENESS
I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MODICUM OF TRUTH IN WHAT WITH SUCH AN INTENSITY OF BITTERNESS THE SPEAKER SUGGESTED THE PICTURE WHICH IN MY MENTAL GALLERY I HAD HUNG IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR SEEMED TO SAY THE LEAST
THE PACKET WAS BOUND ABOUT BY A STRING OF PINK RIBBON A FACT ON WHICH HE PRESENTLY BEGAN TO COMMENT WITH WHAT A PRETTY STRING YOU HAVE ENCIRCLED IT AND HOW NEATLY IT IS TIED SURELY ONLY A WOMAN'S HAND COULD TIE A KNOT LIKE THAT
YOU HID IT AS ONE HIDES TREASURE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING HERE WORTH HAVING WORTH SEEING WORTH KNOWING YES WORTH KNOWING SINCE YOU FOUND IT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO HIDE IT UP SO CLOSELY AS I HAVE SAID
I SHOULD NOT FAIL TO KNOW IT THE CALIGRAPHY WAS LIKE THE PAPER UNUSUAL BOLD DECIDED AND I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED PRODUCED BY A J PEN ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS READING
AND MUST NOT A SLOOP BUILT BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN AND MANNED BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN BE ENGLISH FROM KEEL TO GUNWALE HATTERAS WAS STILL SILENT NO CONTINUED CLAWBONNY THE REAL TRUTH IS IT IS NOT THE SLOOP YOU CARE ABOUT IT IS THE MAN
WHEN THE COLD RETURNED IN FULL FORCE
BUT WITH THESE INOFFENSIVE ANIMALS CAME BACK THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES FOXES AND WOLVES ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF THEIR PREY AND DISMAL HOWLS BROKE THE SILENCE OF THE SHORT NIGHT ARCTIC WOLVES CLOSELY RESEMBLE DOGS
NO MY FRIEND I DON'T IT IS A LAST BLOW FROM THE COLD YOU SEE THESE ARE HIS DOMINIONS AND HE WON'T BE DRIVEN OUT WITHOUT MAKING SOME RESISTANCE HE CAN DEFEND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL SAID BELL RUBBING HIS FACE YES BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED
I HATE HIM WITH A THOROUGH ENGLISH HATRED FATE HAS THROWN HIM IN MY PATH TO SAVE YOU TO RUIN ME HE SEEMS TO DEFY ME AND SPEAKS AS IF HE WERE LORD AND MASTER
WELL HATTERAS SUPPOSE IT IS SO DOES IT FOLLOW THAT THIS EXPEDITION IS TO SEARCH FOR THE NORTH POLE MAY IT NOT BE TO FIND THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BUT ANYWAY
HE THINKS HE HAS MY DESTINY IN HIS HANDS AND KNOWS ALL MY PROJECTS DIDN'T WE SEE THE MAN IN HIS TRUE COLOURS WHEN WE WERE GIVING NAMES TO THE DIFFERENT COASTS HAS HE EVER AVOWED HIS OBJECT IN COMING SO FAR NORTH
THIS WAS VIOLENT QUINSY BUT UNDER THE DOCTOR'S SKILFUL TREATMENT IT WAS SOON CURED ICE WAS THE ONLY REMEDY HE EMPLOYED ADMINISTERED IN SMALL PIECES
AH IT IS THE BOAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT MAN HATTERAS LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION CALMLY AND EXAMINE THE CASE ON ALL SIDES THE COAST ON WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AT PRESENT MAY TERMINATE ABRUPTLY
MOST CERTAINLY I DO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN EARNESTLY MY BEST INDEED MY ONLY FRIEND AND IF I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE WITHOUT YOUR ASKING WILL YOU CONSIDER MY MOTIVE IS PERFECTLY DISINTERESTED
WE MUST KNOW HOW FAR NEW AMERICA EXTENDS HATTERAS LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS RIVAL BUT SAID NOTHING
BUT BECAUSE THE BOAT WHICH BEARS HIM ACROSS AN UNKNOWN OCEAN OR TOUCHES THE NEW SHORE HAPPENS TO BE MADE OF THE PLANKS OF AN AMERICAN VESSEL A CAST AWAY WRECK OF NO USE TO ANYONE WILL THAT LESSEN THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY
THAT IS THE FACT AND HOW IS IT EXPLAINED IN TWO WAYS SOME SAY THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS COME BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
YET IT WAS HIGH TIME HE WERE BROUGHT TO REASON AS JUNE WAS AT HAND THE ONLY SEASON FOR DISTANT EXPEDITIONS AND THEY COULD NOT START WITHOUT A SHIP HE THOUGHT OVER IT A LONG WHILE AND AT LAST DREW THE CAPTAIN ASIDE AND SAID IN THE KINDEST GENTLEST WAY
ALTAMONT IS IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF OUR OBJECT FOR NEITHER JOHNSON NOR BELL NOR MYSELF HAVE EVER BREATHED A WORD TO HIM ABOUT IT AND I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOT WELL LET HIM ALWAYS REMAIN SO HE MUST BE TOLD IN THE END FOR WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM HERE ALONE WHY NOT
AND SYMPTOMS OF A THAW APPEARED THE ICE BEGAN TO CRACK HERE AND THERE AND JETS OF SALT WATER WERE THROWN UP LIKE FOUNTAINS IN AN ENGLISH PARK
A FEW DAYS LATER THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS THICK VAPOUR ROSE FROM THE SNOW GIVING PROMISE OF THE SPEEDY DISAPPEARANCE OF THESE IMMENSE MASSES THE SUN'S PALE DISC BECAME DEEPER IN COLOUR AND REMAINED LONGER ABOVE THE HORIZON
AND THEIR BARKING WOULD DECEIVE THE MOST PRACTISED EARS EVEN THE CANINE RACE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY IT INDEED IT SEEMS AS IF THE WILY ANIMALS EMPLOYED THIS RUSE TO ATTRACT THE DOGS AND MAKE THEM THEIR PREY
DO YOU LOOK ON ME AS A TRUE HEARTED ENGLISHMAN LIKE YOURSELF ANXIOUS FOR HIS COUNTRY'S GLORY HATTERAS LOOKED SURPRISED BUT SIMPLY SAID I DO
WHAT SHALL WE DO IF WE HAVE NO SHIP HATTERAS MADE NO REPLY TELL ME NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO FIND YOURSELF ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE POLE AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO IT HATTERAS STILL SAID NOTHING BUT BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
AND SUPPOSE THE MAN WON'T ALLOW HIS SHIP TO BE CUT UP IN THAT CASE YOU MUST TAKE THE LAW IN YOUR OWN HANDS AND BUILD A VESSEL IN SPITE OF HIM I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD REFUSE THEN HE MUST BE ASKED BEFORE HE CAN REFUSE
YES FOR I KNOW YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ACTUATED BY SELF INTEREST BUT WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
AND THE OTHER TWO SAINTS WHOSE FETE DAYS FALL THIS MONTH ABSURD PRAY TELL ME WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT WHAT INFLUENCE CAN THEY POSSIBLY HAVE ON THE TEMPERATURE
AN IMMENSE ONE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE HORTICULTURISTS WHO CALL THEM THE PATRON SAINTS OF THE FROST AND FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE GENERALLY THERE IS A PERIODICAL FROST IN THE MONTH OF MAY AND IT IS COLDEST FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH
BESIDES CONTINUED THE DOCTOR LOOK AT THE QUESTION IN ITS MORAL ASPECT HERE IS AN ENGLISHMAN WHO SACRIFICES HIS FORTUNE AND EVEN HIS LIFE TO WIN FRESH GLORY FOR HIS COUNTRY
HE KEPT HIS WORD FOR THAT VERY SAME NIGHT AT SUPPER HE MANAGED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS THE SUBJECT OF MAKING EXCURSIONS DURING SUMMER FOR HYDROGRAPHICAL PURPOSES YOU WILL JOIN US I SUPPOSE ALTAMONT HE SAID OF COURSE REPLIED THE AMERICAN
FOR GAME WAS SO PLENTIFUL THAT IT SEEMED WAITING THEIR GUNS AND THE WHOLE BAY PRESENTED AN ANIMATED APPEARANCE THE THAW MEANWHILE WAS MAKING RAPID PROGRESS
CAN'T HE STAY HERE IN FORT PROVIDENCE HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THAT HATTERAS AND MOREOVER TO LEAVE A MAN IN THAT WAY AND NOT KNOW WHETHER WE MIGHT FIND HIM SAFE WHEN WE CAME BACK WOULD BE WORSE THAN IMPRUDENT IT WOULD BE INHUMAN ALTAMONT WILL COME WITH US
THE BIRDS WERE RETURNING IN FLOCKS AND THE AIR RESOUNDED WITH THEIR DEAFENING CRIES
HE MUST COME BUT WE NEED NOT DISCLOSE OUR PROJECTS LET US TELL HIM NOTHING BUT SIMPLY BUILD A SLOOP FOR THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST HATTERAS COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONSENT BUT SAID
AND OTHERS THAT THE MERE MELTING OF THE SNOW NECESSARILY ABSORBS A LARGE AMOUNT OF HEAT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURE BOTH THEORIES ARE PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT THE FACT REMAINS WHICHEVER WE ACCEPT
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY ASKED ALTAMONT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF COURSE AND WITHOUT BEING A WIZARD
AND NOT HAVE WASTED MY SEED LIKE AN IGNORAMUS
AND THE WATER RAN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES IN CATARACTS AND DASHED IN TORRENTS THROUGH THE RAVINES THE DOCTOR LOST NO TIME IN CLEARING ABOUT AN ACRE OF GROUND IN WHICH HE SOWED THE SEEDS OF ANTI SCORBUTIC PLANTS
THAT ALMOST ALL THESE ANIMALS WERE BEGINNING TO LOSE THEIR WHITE WINTER DRESS AND WOULD SOON PUT ON SUMMER ATTIRE WHILE NATURE WAS ALREADY PROVIDING MOSSES AND POPPIES
CLAWBONNY DETERMINED TO HAVE A TALK WITH THE CAPTAIN ON AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT THE BUILDING OF A SLOOP OUT OF THE PLANKS OF THE PORPOISE THE DOCTOR HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN AS HATTERAS HAD DECLARED SO VEHEMENTLY THAT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO USE A MORSEL OF AMERICAN WOOD
IT OCCURRED ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF MAY DURING THE NIGHT THE DOCTOR WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING ALL HIS WORK TO DO AGAIN BUT HATTERAS BORE THE GRIEVANCE MOST UNPHILOSOPHICALLY
THE PRISONERS WERE FREE AND THEIR JOY FOUND VENT IN THE NOISIEST DEMONSTRATIONS THEY EMPLOYED THE REST OF THE DAY IN REPAIRING THE HOUSE WHICH HAD SUFFERED GREATLY BY THE EXPLOSION THEY CLEARED AWAY THE BLOCKS PILED UP BY THE ANIMALS
AND FILLED UP THE RENTS IN THE WALLS WORKING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN ENLIVENED BY THE MANY SONGS OF OLD JOHNSON NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A SINGULAR RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE
THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT FOR THE COLD LASTED TILL THE END OF THE MONTH AND PUT AN END TO ALL THEIR HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
EVERYTHING WAS FROZEN BIRDS QUADRUPEDS AMPHIBIA DISAPPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SEAL HOLES RECLOSED AND THE ICE ONCE MORE BECAME HARD AS GRANITE THE CHANGE WAS MOST STRIKING
HUNTING WAS THE PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT TO BE HAD THEY SHOT PARTRIDGES PTARMIGANS AND SNOW ORTOLANS WHICH ARE DELICIOUS EATING THE HUNTERS NEVER WENT FAR FROM FORT PROVIDENCE
AND I UNDERSTAND AND SHARE YOUR AMBITION BUT TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECT YOU MUST EMPLOY THE RIGHT MEANS WELL AND HAVE I NOT SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR IT NO HATTERAS YOU HAVE NOT SACRIFICED YOUR PERSONAL ANTIPATHIES
WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT IT STRETCHES RIGHT AWAY TO THE POLE INDEED IF YOUR PRESENT INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT WE OUGHT TO COME TO AN OPEN SEA DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WELL SUPPOSING WE REACH THIS ARCTIC OCEAN AND FIND IT FREE FROM ICE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE
SEVERAL NAVIGATORS HAVE MENTIONED THE FACT AND THE DOCTOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE CONFIRMED IT JOHNSON TOOK CARE NOT TO LET HIS GREENLANDERS LOOSE OF DUK THERE WAS LITTLE FEAR NOTHING COULD TAKE HIM IN FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
THE TINDER WAS FETCHED AND HELD BENEATH THE LENS SO AS TO CATCH THE RAYS IN FULL POWER IN A FEW SECONDS IT TOOK FIRE TO JOHNSON'S RAPTUROUS DELIGHT HE DANCED ABOUT LIKE AN IDIOT ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY AND SHOUTED HURRAH HURRAH
GLANCING UNEASILY AT THE TWO CAPTAINS
BUT DO WE NOT OWE OURS TO HIM NOW I GRANT WITHOUT US HE WOULD NOT BE ALIVE AT THIS MOMENT BUT WITHOUT HIM AND HIS SHIP WHAT WOULD BECOME OF US WELL MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU ARE HERE TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT ANYHOW AND THAT IS A BLESSING
BUT THE ROAD BECAME TOILSOME AND FATIGUING ALTAMONT LAY WATCHING THE HORIZON WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SHARED BY ALL HIS COMPANIONS FOR ACCORDING TO THE LAST RECKONING MADE BY HATTERAS
OVERTURNED ICEBERGS AND BROKEN HUMMOCKS COVERED THE HORIZON WHILE THE FREQUENT BLOCKS OF FRESH WATER ICE SHOWED THAT SOME COAST WAS NEAR NEXT DAY AFTER A HEARTY BREAKFAST OFF THE BEAR'S PAWS THE LITTLE PARTY CONTINUED THEIR ROUTE
AND I MUST SAY THE MAN HAS NOT SHOWN HIMSELF VERY GRATEFUL I AM HERE FORTUNATELY MISTER CLAWBONNY SAID JOHNSON NOW THIS YANKEE HAS COME BACK TO LIFE AGAIN I MUST CONFESS I DON'T MUCH LIKE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
BUT THE AMERICAN MADE ONLY EVASIVE REPLIES AND CLAWBONNY WHISPERED IN OLD JOHNSON'S EAR TWO MEN WE'VE GOT THAT NEED LOOKING AFTER YOU ARE RIGHT SAID JOHNSON HATTERAS NEVER SAYS A WORD TO THIS AMERICAN
YES ONLY I SHOULD LIKE FRESH WATER ICE IT IS HARDER AND MORE TRANSPARENT THAN THE OTHER THERE IT IS TO YOUR HAND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN SAID JOHNSON
AND THE QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH WOULD BE DECIDED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER AT LAST ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALTAMONT STARTED UP WITH A SHOUT THAT ARRESTED THE WHOLE PARTY
WHILE CLAWBONNY HURRIED BACK INTO THE HUT AND REKINDLED THE FIRE THE STOVE WAS SOON ROARING
LOOK AGAIN JOHNSON HE SAID THE BOATSWAIN HURRIED TO THE ONLY REMAINING PLACE HE COULD THINK OF THE HUMMOCK WHERE HE HAD STOOD TO WATCH THE BEAR BUT THE MISSING TREASURE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND THE OLD SAILOR RETURNED IN DESPAIR HATTERAS LOOKED AT HIM
WHAT A FEAST THIS MEAL WAS TO THE POOR STARVING MEN MAY BE IMAGINED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER COUNSELLED MODERATION IN EATING AND SET THE EXAMPLE HIMSELF THIS IS A GLAD DAY FOR US HE SAID AND WE HAVE NO FEAR OF WANTING FOOD ALL THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY
AN IDEA COME INTO YOUR HEAD DOCTOR EXCLAIMED JOHNSON THEN WE ARE SAVED WILL IT SUCCEED THAT'S THE QUESTION WHAT'S YOUR PROJECT SAID HATTERAS WE WANT A LENS WELL LET US MAKE ONE HOW ASKED JOHNSON
THEN YOU THINK THAT ALTAMONT I THINK NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS SHIP IS CERTAINLY ON THE ROAD TO THE NORTH POLE BUT DIDN'T ALTAMONT SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AMONG THE ICE AND DRAGGED THERE IRRESISTIBLY HE SAID SO BUT I FANCIED THERE WAS A PECULIAR SMILE ON HIS LIPS WHILE HE SPOKE
WITHIN LESS THAN FOUR DEGREES OF THE POLE LESS THAN FOUR DEGREES REPEATED ALTAMONT WITH A SIGH YES MY SHIP WENT FURTHER THAN ANY OTHER HAS EVER VENTURED IT IS TIME WE STARTED SAID HATTERAS ABRUPTLY YES REPLIED THE DOCTOR
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF HE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE PROJECTS OF HATTERAS DO YOU THINK HIS OWN WERE SIMILAR WHO KNOWS
EACH MAN WITH A LOAD ON HIS BACK CLAWBONNY WAS STRUCK WITH THE COLDNESS THAT PERVADED THE ATMOSPHERE ON GOING UP TO THE STOVE HE FOUND THE FIRE BLACK OUT THE EXCITING BUSINESS OF THE MORNING HAD MADE JOHNSON NEGLECT HIS ACCUSTOMED DUTY OF REPLENISHING THE STOVE
NO AND IT IS A GREAT PITY FOR THE SUN'S RAYS ARE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH JUST NOW TO LIGHT OUR TINDER WELL SAID HATTERAS WE MUST JUST APPEASE OUR HUNGER WITH THE RAW MEAT AND SET OFF AGAIN AS SOON AS WE CAN TO TRY TO DISCOVER THE SHIP YES REPLIED CLAWBONNY
I HOPE I MAY MANAGE IT JOHNSON THE JOURNEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY FRESH INCIDENT BUT ON THE SATURDAY MORNING THE TRAVELLERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A REGION OF QUITE AN ALTERED CHARACTER INSTEAD OF THE WIDE SMOOTH PLAIN OF ICE THAT HAD HITHERTO STRETCHED BEFORE THEM
AND THE GREEN TINGE YOU ARE RIGHT BRING YOUR HATCHET JOHNSON A GOOD SIZED PIECE WAS SOON CUT OFF ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER AND THE DOCTOR SET TO WORK HE BEGAN BY CHOPPING IT INTO ROUGH SHAPE WITH THE HATCHET THEN HE OPERATED UPON IT MORE CAREFULLY WITH HIS KNIFE
BUT NO WORD OF REPROACH ESCAPED HIS LIPS HE ONLY SAID THIS IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS DOCTOR IT IS INDEED SAID CLAWBONNY WE HAVE NOT EVEN AN INSTRUMENT SOME GLASS THAT WE MIGHT TAKE THE LENS OUT OF AND USE LIKE A BURNING GLASS
MAKING AS SMOOTH A SURFACE AS POSSIBLE AND FINISHED THE POLISHING PROCESS WITH HIS FINGERS RUBBING AWAY UNTIL HE HAD OBTAINED AS TRANSPARENT A LENS AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OF MAGNIFICENT CRYSTAL THE SUN WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY ENOUGH FOR THE DOCTOR'S EXPERIMENT
SPEAKING TO HIMSELF ABSORBED IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS YES THAT MIGHT DO AT A PINCH WHY NOT WE MIGHT TRY WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING ABOUT ASKED HATTERAS
AND POINTING TO A WHITE MASS THAT NO EYE BUT HIS COULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SURROUNDING ICEBERGS EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD RINGING VOICE
IT MEASURED NEARLY NINE FEET LONG AND FOUR ROUND AND THE GREAT TUSKS IN HIS JAWS WERE THREE INCHES LONG ON CUTTING THE CARCASE OPEN JOHNSON FOUND NOTHING BUT WATER IN THE STOMACH THE BEAST HAD EVIDENTLY HAD NO FOOD FOR A LONG TIME
HURRAH BRAVO SHOUTED JOHNSON AND THE DOCTOR BUT HATTERAS WAS AS COOL AND UNEXCITED AS POSSIBLE AND STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GAZING AT HIS PROSTRATE FOE IT IS MY TURN NOW SAID JOHNSON IT IS A GOOD THING THE BEAR IS KILLED
HE FELT IN THE OTHER POCKETS BUT IT WAS NOT THERE THEN HE WENT INTO THE HUT AGAIN AND SHOOK THE BLANKET HE HAD SLEPT IN ALL NIGHT BUT HIS SEARCH WAS STILL UNSUCCESSFUL HE WENT BACK TO HIS COMPANIONS AND SAID ARE YOU SURE DOCTOR YOU HAVEN'T THE STEEL QUITE JOHNSON AND YOU HAVEN'T IT EITHER CAPTAIN
STILL WE MUST NOT FORGET WE HAVE FURTHER TO GO YET AND I THINK THE SOONER WE START THE BETTER WE CANNOT BE FAR OFF NOW SAID ALTAMONT WHO COULD ALMOST ARTICULATE PERFECTLY AGAIN WE MUST BE WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS MARCH OF THE PORPOISE
WOULD BE A BAD JOB MISTER CLAWBONNY IF ANY FEELING OF RIVALRY CAME BETWEEN TWO MEN OF THEIR STAMP HEAVEN FORFEND FOR IT MIGHT INVOLVE THE MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES JOHNSON I HOPE ALTAMONT WILL REMEMBER HE OWES HIS LIFE TO US
THE DOCTOR TRIED TO BLOW THE EMBERS INTO A FLAME BUT FINDING HE COULD NOT EVEN GET A RED SPARK HE WENT OUT TO THE SLEDGE TO FETCH TINDER AND GET THE STEEL FROM JOHNSON THE OLD SAILOR PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BUT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE STEEL MISSING
WITH A PIECE OF ICE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD DO WHY NOT ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS TO COLLECT THE SUN'S RAYS INTO ONE COMMON FOCUS AND ICE WILL SERVE THAT PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE FINEST CRYSTAL IS IT POSSIBLE SAID JOHNSON
HE BEGAN FORTHWITH TO STRIP THE SKIN OFF
MY LENS DOES WELL ENOUGH AT PRESENT BUT IT NEEDS THE SUN
WELL I HAVE NOT GOT IT NOW EXCLAIMED JOHNSON TURNING PALE
YET IT WAS VERY FAT AND WEIGHED FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS THE HUNTERS WERE SO FAMISHED THAT THEY HAD HARDLY PATIENCE TO CARRY HOME THE FLESH TO BE COOKED AND IT NEEDED ALL THE DOCTOR'S PERSUASION TO PREVENT THEM EATING IT RAW ON ENTERING THE HUT
INEXPERIENCED HUNTERS HE SAID HAVE OFTEN LOST A WHOLE SHOAL BY ATTACKING THEM EN MASSE WITH NOISY SHOUTS INSTEAD OF SINGLY AND SILENTLY IS IT FOR THE OIL OR SKIN THAT THEY ARE MOSTLY HUNTED EUROPEANS HUNT THEM FOR THE SKIN
WELL REPLIED ALTAMONT I'M AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW YOU OH I'M PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING AFTER THE MERCURY BULLET AND THE ICE LENS AND FORT PROVIDENCE I BELIEVE MISTER CLAWBONNY CAN DO ANYTHING EXCLAIMED JOHNSON
IT QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL THE JOURNALS OF ARCTIC TRAVELLERS BEING SO FULL OF EATING AND DRINKING YOU ARE RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SAME FACT BUT I THINK IT ARISES NOT ONLY FROM THE NECESSITY OF FULL DIET BUT FROM THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY
AND I'LL BET YOU SOMETHING I COULD DRESS YOU CUTLETS YOU WOULD NOT TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT UNLESS FOR THEIR BLACK APPEARANCE WE'LL SET YOU TO WORK ON IT SAID BELL AND I'LL EAT AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE TO PLEASE YOU MY GOOD BELL
DEVOURED A QUARTER OF A BUFFALO IN ONE MORNING THEY CUT THE MEAT IN LONG NARROW STRIPS AND THE MODE OF EATING WAS EITHER FOR THE ONE TO BITE OFF AS MUCH AS HIS MOUTH COULD HOLD AND THEN PASS IT ON TO THE OTHER
NO SEAL OIL WOULD NOT GIVE NEARLY SUFFICIENT LIGHT IT WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE THROUGH THE FOG ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO MAKE GAS OUT OF OUR COAL THEN NO NOT THAT EITHER FOR GAS WOULD NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH AND WORSE STILL IT WOULD WASTE OUR COMBUSTIBLES
NOT I SAID ALTAMONT IT RATHER SICKENS ME AND MAKES ME LOATHE THE SIGHT OF A SEAL BUT STOP I DO BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF A DINNER OFF ONE FOR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ALIVE LYING ON THOSE LUMPS OF ICE YONDER
MILK DIET IS THEIR STAPLE FOOD WITH EGGS AND BREAD MADE OF THE BARK OF THE BIRCH TREE A LITTLE SALMON OCCASIONALLY BUT NEVER MEAT AND STILL THEY ARE FINE HARDY FELLOWS IT IS AN AFFAIR OF ORGANIZATION OUT OF MY POWER TO EXPLAIN
I THINK OF CONSTRUCTING A LIGHTHOUSE ON THE TOP OF THAT CONE ABOVE OUR HEADS A LIGHTHOUSE THEY ALL EXCLAIMED YES A LIGHTHOUSE
BUT THEN WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ONE MEAL SOMETIMES HAS TO LAST A WHOLE DAY THIS VORACITY MUST BE PECULIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF COLD COUNTRIES SAID ALTAMONT I THINK IT IS REPLIED THE DOCTOR IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS PEOPLE MUST EAT ENORMOUSLY
AND THE BRIGHT RAYS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT DID DUTY FOR THE GLORIOUS ORB OF DAY
HE SUCCEEDED THOUGH WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE TOP WHICH HE FOUND TERMINATED ABRUPTLY IN A SORT OF TRUNCATED CONE
THEY CAN EXPAND AT WILL AND I MAY ADD CONTRACT AT WILL SO THAT THEY CAN ENDURE STARVATION QUITE AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE WHEN AN ESQUIMAUX SITS DOWN TO DINNER HE IS QUITE THIN AND BY THE TIME HE HAS FINISHED HE IS SO CORPULENT YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM
INVIGORATING REGIMEN CERTAINLY SAID BELL NOT SO MUCH AS YOU IMAGINE MY FRIEND AN INDIAN WHO GUZZLES LIKE THAT CAN'T DO A WHIT BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAS HIS POUND OF BEEF AND PINT OF BEER THINGS ARE BEST AS THEY ARE THEN MISTER CLAWBONNY
ONE MUST BE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WAS CLAWBONNY'S MODEST REPLY
THERE IS PLENTY OF MATERIAL IN AN HOUR WE CAN RAISE A PILLAR OF ICE TEN FEET HIGH AND THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH AWAY WENT THE DOCTOR FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE COLUMN WAS SOON ERECTED AND CROWNED WITH A SHIP LANTERN
THE QUESTION WAS RAISED WHETHER TO CONSTRUCT A HUT AND REST TILL MORNING OR PROCEED BUT CLAWBONNY INSISTED ON GOING ON AS HATTERAS AND JOHNSON WOULD BE SO UNEASY DUK WILL GUIDE US HE SAID HE WON'T GO WRONG
THE HUNTERS SEPARATED GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO AS TO SURROUND THE ANIMAL AND CUT OFF ALL RETREAT THEY CREPT ALONG CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE HUMMOCKS
IT IS A WALRUS EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR BE QUIET AND LET US GET UP TO HIM CLAWBONNY WAS RIGHT IT WAS A WALRUS OF HUGE DIMENSIONS DISPORTING HIMSELF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
A REGULAR COURSE OF LIFE COMMENCED NOW THOUGH UNCERTAIN WEATHER AND FREQUENT CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE MADE IT SOMETIMES IMPRACTICABLE TO VENTURE OUTSIDE THE HUT AT ALL
WELL THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY THEN IN PRODUCING AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THAT WILL COST NOTHING AND BE FAR BRIGHTER FIRST RATE SAID JOHNSON LET US SET TO WORK AT ONCE BY ALL MEANS
FROM THIS ELEVATION THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE VIEW OVER A VAST TRACT OF COUNTRY WHICH WAS ALL DISORDERED AND CONVULSED AS IF IT HAD UNDERGONE SOME VOLCANIC COMMOTION
WERE COVERED WITH A SHEET OF ICE A NEW PROJECT STRUCK THE DOCTOR'S MIND WHICH WAS SOON MATURED AND RIPE FOR EXECUTION HE LOST NO TIME IN GOING BACK TO THE SNOW HOUSE AND CONSULTING OVER IT WITH HIS COMPANIONS I HAVE GOT AN IDEA HE SAID
SOMETIMES IN PROCURING IT THE THOUGHT OF FOOD IS ALWAYS UPPERMOST IN THE MIND AND NATURALLY FINDS MENTION IN THE NARRATIVE AND YET SAID ALTAMONT IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT IN THE COLDEST PARTS OF NORWAY THE PEASANTS DO NOT SEEM TO NEED SUCH SUBSTANTIAL FARE
THE CONDUCTING WIRES WERE PROPERLY ADJUSTED WITHIN IT AND THE PILE WITH WHICH THEY COMMUNICATED FIXED UP IN THE SITTING ROOM WHERE THE WARMTH OF THE STOVE WOULD PROTECT IT FROM THE ACTION OF THE FROST AS SOON AS IT GREW DARK THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE AND PROVED A COMPLETE SUCCESS
AND SOON LAY DEAD REDDENING THE ICE FIELD WITH HIS BLOOD IT WAS A FINE ANIMAL MEASURING MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN LENGTH
AN INTENSE BRILLIANT LIGHT STREAMED FROM THE LANTERN AND ILLUMINED THE ENTIRE PLATEAU AND THE PLAINS BENEATH JOHNSON COULD NOT HELP CLAPPING HIS HANDS HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT WELL I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY HE EXCLAIMED YOU'RE OUR SUN NOW
THEY STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING EACH ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND PLENTY OF POWDER AND SHOT
LET US GO THE SHORTEST ROAD HOWEVER AND GET QUICKLY HOME WITHOUT LOSING OUR WAY THE STARS WILL GUIDE US THEY RESOLVED TO TRY A MORE DIRECT ROUTE BACK BY GOING FURTHER INLAND AND AVOIDING THE WINDINGS OF THE COAST
OR TO LEAVE THE LONG RIBBONS OF MEAT DANGLING FROM THE MOUTH AND DEVOUR THEM GRADUALLY LIKE BOA CONSTRICTORS
HIS INSTINCT CAN DISPENSE WITH STAR AND COMPASS JUST LET US KEEP CLOSE BEHIND HIM
COME CLAWBONNY TELL US WHAT YOUR LIGHT IS TO BE THEN SAID ALTAMONT THAT'S SOON TOLD REPLIED CLAWBONNY I MEAN TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT YES WHY NOT HAVEN'T YOU A GALVANIC BATTERY ON BOARD YOUR SHIP YES
CHAPTER EIGHT AN EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF VICTORIA BAY NEXT MORNING CLAWBONNY WAS OUT BY DAWN OF DAY CLAMBERING UP THE STEEP ROCKY WALL AGAINST WHICH THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE LEANED
NO DOUBT OF IT AND YET AN ESQUIMAUX MEAL MAY WELL ASTONISH US IN SIR JOHN ROSS'S NARRATIVE HE STATES HIS SURPRISE AT THE APPETITES OF HIS GUIDES HE TELLS US THAT TWO OF THEM JUST TWO MIND
AND THE HARD SNOW SO FAVOURED THEIR MARCH THAT IN THREE HOURS THEY HAD GONE FIFTEEN MILES DUK JUMPING AND BARKING BESIDE THEM ALL THE WAY
BUT FOUND NO TRACE OF HUMAN HABITATION AND INDEED SCARCELY A SIGN OF ANIMAL LIFE A FEW SNOW BIRDS HOWEVER DARTING TO AND FRO ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SPRING AND THE RETURN OF THE ANIMAL CREATION THE SEA WAS STILL ENTIRELY FROZEN OVER
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE OPEN BREATHING HOLES IN THE ICE THAT THE SEALS HAD BEEN QUITE RECENTLY ON THE SURFACE IN ONE PART THE HOLES WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT THE DOCTOR SAID TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT WHEN SUMMER CAME THEY WOULD BE SEEN
THERE IN HUNDREDS AND WOULD BE EASILY CAPTURED FOR ON UNFREQUENTED SHORES THEY WERE NOT SO DIFFICULT OF APPROACH BUT ONCE FRIGHTEN THEM AND THEY ALL VANISH AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT AND NEVER RETURN TO THE SPOT AGAIN
EVERY MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF DINING REMARKED THE PHILOSOPHICAL AMERICAN HAPPILY SAID THE DOCTOR WELL IF EATING IS SUCH AN IMPERATIVE NECESSITY IN THESE LATITUDES
AND ALSO SERVE TO ILLUMINE OUR PLATEAU IN THE LONG DREARY WINTER MONTHS THERE IS NO DOUBT REPLIED ALTAMONT OF ITS UTILITY BUT HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT
THE MOON HAD NOT YET RISEN BUT THE SKY WAS SERENE AND CLOUDLESS AND ALREADY GLITTERING WITH STARS MAGNIFICENT STARS COME SAID THE DOCTOR LET US BE OFF FOR IT IS GETTING LATE
THEY LIVE ON SEALS AND NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS TO THEM AS A PIECE OF THE FLESH DIPPED IN THE BLOOD AND OIL
YOU MEAN TO SAY TO PLEASE YOURSELF BUT YOUR VORACITY WOULD NEVER EQUAL THE GREEN LANDERS FOR THEY DEVOUR FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN POUNDS OF MEAT A DAY FIFTEEN POUNDS SAID BELL WHAT STOMACHS ARCTIC STOMACHS REPLIED THE DOCTOR ARE PRODIGIOUS
IT IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH BUT OF EXISTENCE
EVEN IF WE OURSELVES WERE TO REMAIN IN THIS BLESSED COUNTRY LONG WE SHOULD BE AS BAD AS THE ESQUIMAUX EVEN IF WE ESCAPED BECOMING REGULAR GLUTTONS I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU MAKE ME FEEL HUNGRY WITH TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT EATING EXCLAIMED BELL
FOR THE LIGHT WAS EQUAL TO THREE THOUSAND CANDLES OR THREE HUNDRED GAS BURNERS IT WAS INTENSELY COLD BUT DRY AND THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO WIND THE HUNTERS SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF CAPE WASHINGTON
BUT THE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH CUTTING OFF THE MOST SAVOURY PARTS AND LEFT THE REST TO THE RAVENS WHICH HAD JUST BEGUN TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE
REPLIED CLAWBONNY BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF THESE SAME NORWEGIANS WERE TRANSPLANTED TO GREENLAND
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW MANY TREASURES THE WOODS AND HILLSIDES YIELDED THAT WOULD DO FOR TOMMY SURROUNDED BY PLAYTHINGS SUCH AS NEVER CHILD OUT OF FAIRYLAND HAD BEFORE IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT TOMMY WAS CONTENT
GENTLEMEN WILL PLEASE PASS IN AT THE FRONT DOOR ROUND THE TABLE AND OUT AT THE BACK DOOR THEM AS WISHES TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TOWARD THE ORPHAN WILL FIND A HAT HANDY THE FIRST MAN ENTERED WITH HIS HAT ON
AND SO PASSED OUT OF ROARING CAMP ITS SIN AND SHAME FOREVER I DO NOT THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT DISTURBED THEM MUCH EXCEPT IN SPECULATION AS TO THE FATE OF THE CHILD CAN HE LIVE NOW WAS ASKED OF STUMPY
ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE SETTLEMENT THE CABIN ASSIGNED TO TOMMY LUCK OR THE LUCK AS HE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CALLED FIRST SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
THE LAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CAMP THEY DULY PREEMPTED THIS
DAMN THE COST STRANGE TO SAY THE CHILD THRIVED PERHAPS THE INVIGORATING CLIMATE OF THE MOUNTAIN CAMP WAS COMPENSATION FOR MATERIAL DEFICIENCIES NATURE TOOK THE FOUNDLING TO HER BROADER BREAST
SAID THE COCKNEY SIMMONS MEDITATIVELY RECLINING ON HIS ELBOW IS EVINGLY IT REMINDED HIM OF GREENWICH ON THE LONG SUMMER DAYS
EACH GORGE AND GULCH
A GRAVITY AS INSCRUTABLE AS THAT OF THE NEWLY BORN ON HIS RIGHT ONLY ONE INCIDENT OCCURRED TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF THE CURIOUS PROCESSION AS KENTUCK BENT OVER THE CANDLE BOX
EYEING THE FACES AROUND HIM BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS THING AIN'T EXACTLY ON THE SQUAR IT'S PLAYING IT PRETTY LOW DOWN ON THIS YER BABY TO RING IN FUN ON HIM THAT HE AIN'T GOIN TO UNDERSTAND
SO THE REHABILITATION OF THE CABIN BECAME A NECESSITY THE MEN WHO WERE IN THE HABIT OF LOUNGING IN AT STUMPY'S TO SEE HOW THE LUCK GOT ON SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE CHANGE
THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS HE SAID AS HE EXTRICATED HIS FINGER WITH PERHAPS MORE TENDERNESS AND CARE THAN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF SHOWING HE HELD THAT FINGER A LITTLE APART FROM ITS FELLOWS AS HE WENT OUT
BUT SAID STUMPY QUICKLY FOLLOWING UP HIS ADVANTAGE WE'RE HERE FOR A CHRISTENING AND WE'LL HAVE IT I PROCLAIM YOU THOMAS LUCK ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
HE DRANK QUITE FREELY AND RELATED WITH GREAT GUSTO HIS EXPERIENCE INVARIABLY ENDING WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC CONDEMNATION OF THE NEWCOMER
BUT THE UNLUCKY SUGGESTION MET WITH FIERCE AND UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NO PLAN WHICH ENTAILED PARTING FROM THEIR NEW ACQUISITION WOULD FOR A MOMENT BE ENTERTAINED BESIDES SAID TOM RYDER
WAS THE FIRST SPASM OF PROPRIETY THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF THE CAMP'S REGENERATION STUMPY ADVANCED NOTHING PERHAPS HE FELT A CERTAIN DELICACY IN INTERFERING WITH THE SELECTION OF A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE
BESIDE THE LOW BUNK OR SHELF ON WHICH THE FIGURE OF THE MOTHER WAS STARKLY OUTLINED BELOW THE BLANKETS STOOD A PINE TABLE ON THIS A CANDLE BOX WAS PLACED AND WITHIN IT
BY THE TIME HE WAS A MONTH OLD THE NECESSITY OF GIVING HIM A NAME BECAME APPARENT HE HAD GENERALLY BEEN KNOWN AS THE KID STUMPY'S BOY THE COYOTE
STUMPY WAS RETAINED CERTAIN ARTICLES WERE SENT FOR TO SACRAMENTO MIND SAID THE TREASURER AS HE PRESSED A BAG OF GOLD DUST INTO THE EXPRESSMAN'S HAND THE BEST THAT CAN BE GOT LACE YOU KNOW AND FILIGREE WORK AND FRILLS
AGAIN STUMPY IMPOSED A KIND OF QUARANTINE UPON THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING THE LUCK IT WAS A CRUEL MORTIFICATION TO KENTUCK
AIN'T BIGGER NOR A DERRINGER
A SILVER TOBACCO BOX A DOUBLOON A NAVY REVOLVER SILVER MOUNTED A GOLD SPECIMEN A VERY BEAUTIFULLY EMBROIDERED LADY'S HANDKERCHIEF FROM OAKHURST THE GAMBLER
TO ITS GENERAL VIRTUE AND USEFULNESS CAN ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THEIR AFFECTION FOR TOMMY A FEW STILL HELD OUT BUT THE RESOLVE COULD NOT BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT FOR THREE MONTHS
THE MEN HAD SUDDENLY AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THERE WERE BEAUTY AND SIGNIFICANCE IN THESE TRIFLES
IT WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND WHITEWASHED THEN IT WAS BOARDED CLOTHED AND PAPERED THE ROSE WOOD CRADLE PACKED EIGHTY MILES BY MULE HAD IN STUMPY'S WAY OF PUTTING IT SORTER KILLED THE REST OF THE FURNITURE
AN ALLUSION TO HIS VOCAL POWERS AND EVEN BY KENTUCK'S ENDEARING DIMINUTIVE OF THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS BUT THESE WERE FELT TO BE VAGUE AND UNSATISFACTORY AND WERE AT LAST DISMISSED UNDER ANOTHER INFLUENCE
SEEN IT WINDING LIKE A SILVER THREAD UNTIL IT WAS LOST IN THE STARS ABOVE A FIRE OF WITHERED PINE BOUGHS ADDED SOCIABILITY TO THE GATHERING
THE MEN CONVERSED IN WHISPERS OR SMOKED WITH INDIAN GRAVITY PROFANITY WAS TACITLY GIVEN UP IN THESE SACRED PRECINCTS AND THROUGHOUT THE CAMP A POPULAR FORM OF EXPLETIVE KNOWN AS
SUCH WAS THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE MEN THAT WERE DISPERSED AROUND THE CABIN
NEARLY EXHAUSTED ABOUT TWO MILES BELOW
THEM FELLOWS AT RED DOG WOULD SWAP IT AND RING IN SOMEBODY ELSE ON US A DISBELIEF IN THE HONESTY OF OTHER CAMPS PREVAILED AT ROARING CAMP AS IN OTHER PLACES
AND DID THEY BELONG HERE IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO SHOW THEM KENTUCK LYING THERE CRUELLY CRUSHED AND BRUISED BUT STILL HOLDING THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP IN HIS ARMS
BUT WHEN QUESTIONED HE AVERRED STOUTLY THAT HE AND JINNY THE MAMMAL BEFORE ALLUDED TO COULD MANAGE TO REAR THE CHILD THERE WAS SOMETHING ORIGINAL INDEPENDENT AND HEROIC ABOUT THE PLAN THAT PLEASED THE CAMP
HAD SPENT TWO DAYS IN PREPARING A BURLESQUE OF THE CHURCH SERVICE WITH POINTED LOCAL ALLUSIONS THE CHOIR WAS PROPERLY TRAINED AND SANDY TIPTON WAS TO STAND GODFATHER
AND THE MINORITY MEEKLY YIELDED IN THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT TURN UP TO PREVENT IT AND IT DID THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL LONG BE REMEMBERED IN THE FOOTHILLS THE SNOW LAY DEEP ON THE SIERRAS
A LANCET A BANK OF ENGLAND NOTE FOR FIVE POUNDS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN LOOSE GOLD AND SILVER COIN
NOR WERE MORAL AND SOCIAL SANITARY LAWS NEGLECTED TOMMY
I CREP UP THE BANK JUST NOW SAID KENTUCK ONE DAY IN A BREATHLESS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
OF THE RECKLESS IRREVERENCE OF ROARING CAMP THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES WAS ONE BOSTON A NOTED WAG AND THE OCCASION SEEMED TO PROMISE THE GREATEST FACETIOUSNESS THIS INGENIOUS SATIRIST
AND KENTUCK HAD THE WEAKNESSES OF THE NOBLER SEX WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAD GONE TO BED
AND YOU ARE DYING TOO A SMILE LIT THE EYES OF THE EXPIRING KENTUCK DYING HE REPEATED HE'S A TAKING ME WITH HIM TELL THE BOYS I'VE GOT THE LUCK WITH ME NOW AND THE STRONG MAN
THE ASSEMBLAGE NUMBERED ABOUT A HUNDRED MEN ONE OR TWO OF THESE WERE ACTUAL FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE SOME WERE CRIMINAL AND ALL WERE RECKLESS PHYSICALLY THEY EXHIBITED NO INDICATION OF THEIR PAST LIVES AND CHARACTER
HE SAID AND RETIRED THE NEXT DAY CHEROKEE SAL HAD SUCH RUDE SEPULTURE AS ROARING CAMP AFFORDED
THE PINES STOPPED MOANING
KEPT THE RESERVE OF ROARING CAMP INVIOLATE THE EXPRESSMAN THEIR ONLY CONNECTING LINK WITH THE SURROUNDING WORLD SOMETIMES TOLD WONDERFUL STORIES OF THE CAMP HE WOULD SAY THEY'VE A STREET UP THERE IN ROARING
THE CAMP MAY HAVE BEEN DEFICIENT BUT THESE SLIGHT OMISSIONS DID NOT DETRACT FROM THEIR AGGREGATE FORCE THE STRONGEST MAN HAD BUT THREE FINGERS ON HIS RIGHT HAND THE BEST SHOT HAD BUT ONE EYE
AND CURSE THE LUCK WAS ABANDONED AS HAVING A NEW PERSONAL BEARING VOCAL MUSIC WAS NOT INTERDICTED BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SOOTHING TRANQUILIZING QUALITY AND ONE SONG
AND TO INVITE ONE OR TWO DECENT FAMILIES TO RESIDE THERE FOR THE SAKE OF THE LUCK
HE APPEARED TO BE SERENELY HAPPY ALBEIT THERE WAS AN INFANTINE GRAVITY ABOUT HIM
THE GREATEST SCAMP HAD A RAPHAEL FACE WITH A PROFUSION OF BLONDE HAIR OAKHURST A GAMBLER HAD THE MELANCHOLY AIR AND INTELLECTUAL ABSTRACTION OF A HAMLET THE COOLEST AND MOST COURAGEOUS MAN
IT SEEMED AS IF NATURE HAD STOPPED TO LISTEN TOO THE CAMP ROSE TO ITS FEET AS ONE MAN IT WAS PROPOSED TO EXPLODE A BARREL OF GUNPOWDER
WHICH LIKE A SNAKE'S ONLY SLOUGHED OFF THROUGH DECAY TO BE DEBARRED THIS PRIVILEGE FROM CERTAIN PRUDENTIAL REASONS YET SUCH WAS THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF INNOVATION THAT HE THEREAFTER APPEARED REGULARLY EVERY AFTERNOON IN A CLEAN SHIRT AND FACE
HALF CURIOUSLY THE CHILD TURNED AND IN A SPASM OF PAIN CAUGHT AT HIS GROPING FINGER AND HELD IT FAST FOR A MOMENT KENTUCK LOOKED FOOLISH AND EMBARRASSED
ALSO MET WITH OBJECTION IT WAS ARGUED THAT NO DECENT WOMAN COULD BE PREVAILED TO ACCEPT ROARING CAMP AS HER HOME AND THE SPEAKER URGED THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE OF THE OTHER KIND THIS UNKIND ALLUSION TO THE DEFUNCT MOTHER
THE TERM ROUGHS APPLIED TO THEM WAS A DISTINCTION RATHER THAN A DEFINITION
SMOKING THEIR PIPES AND DRINKING IN THE MELODIOUS UTTERANCES AN INDISTINCT IDEA THAT THIS WAS PASTORAL HAPPINESS PERVADED THE CAMP THIS ERE KIND O THINK
IN THAT RARE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS THAT AIR PUNGENT WITH BALSAMIC ODOR THAT ETHEREAL CORDIAL AT ONCE BRACING AND EXHILARATING HE MAY HAVE FOUND FOOD AND NOURISHMENT
MUST NOT BE DISTURBED BY NOISE
FRAGMENT OF VARIEGATED QUARTZ A BRIGHT PEBBLE FROM THE BED OF THE CREEK BECAME BEAUTIFUL TO EYES THUS CLEARED AND STRENGTHENED
THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE THE CAMP SOUGHT REPOSE A LIGHT BURNT IN THE CABIN WHERE THE WATCHERS SAT FOR STUMPY DID NOT GO TO BED THAT NIGHT NOR DID KENTUCK
AND AGAIN PASSED THE CABIN HALFWAY DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BANK HE AGAIN PAUSED AND THEN RETURNED AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR IT WAS OPENED BY STUMPY HOW GOES IT SAID KENTUCK LOOKING PAST STUMPY TOWARD THE CANDLE BOX
LAY THE LAST ARRIVAL AT ROARING CAMP BESIDE THE CANDLE BOX WAS PLACED A HAT ITS USE WAS SOON INDICATED GENTLEMEN SAID STUMPY WITH A SINGULAR MIXTURE OF AUTHORITY AND EX OFFICIO COMPLACENCY
SO HELP ME GOD IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE NAME OF THE DEITY HAD BEEN OTHERWISE UTTERED THAN PROFANELY IN THE CAMP THE FORM OF CHRISTENING WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE SATIRIST HAD CONCEIVED
THE ONLY OUTLET WAS A STEEP TRAIL OVER THE SUMMIT OF A HILL THAT FACED THE CABIN NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE RISING MOON THE SUFFERING WOMAN MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE RUDE BUNK WHEREON SHE LAY
SUNG BY MAN O' WAR JACK AN ENGLISH SAILOR FROM HER MAJESTY'S AUSTRALIAN COLONIES WAS QUITE POPULAR AS A LULLABY IT WAS A LUGUBRIOUS RECITAL OF THE EXPLOITS OF THE ARETHUSA SEVENTY FOUR
THE ANSWER WAS DOUBTFUL THE ONLY OTHER BEING OF CHEROKEE SAL'S SEX AND MATERNAL CONDITION IN THE SETTLEMENT WAS AN ASS THERE WAS SOME CONJECTURE AS TO FITNESS BUT THE EXPERIMENT WAS TRIED IT WAS LESS PROBLEMATICAL
HE SAW THAT PIN AND WENT TWO DIAMONDS BETTER A SLUNG SHOT A BIBLE CONTRIBUTOR NOT DETECTED A GOLDEN SPUR A SILVER TEASPOON THE INITIALS I REGRET TO SAY WERE NOT THE GIVER'S A PAIR OF SURGEON'S SHEARS
THAT WOULD LAY OVER ANY STREET IN RED DOG THEY'VE GOT VINES AND FLOWERS ROUND THEIR HOUSES AND THEY WASH THEMSELVES TWICE A DAY BUT THEY'RE MIGHTY ROUGH ON STRANGERS
ALL SERENE REPLIED STUMPY ANYTHING UP NOTHING THERE WAS A PAUSE AN EMBARRASSING ONE STUMPY STILL HOLDING THE DOOR THEN KENTUCK HAD RECOURSE TO HIS FINGER WHICH HE HELD UP TO STUMPY
BUT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SITUATION OF THE MOTHER BETTER COUNSELS PREVAILED
SHE WOULD SEND WANDERING BREEZES TO VISIT HIM WITH THE BALM OF BAY AND RESINOUS GUM
THAT DESCENDED THE HILLSIDES
NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER WAS UNKNOWN IT'S BETTER SAID THE PHILOSOPHICAL OAKHURST TO TAKE A FRESH DEAL ALL ROUND
IT BEEN HERE ONCE AND WILL BE HERE AGAIN AND THAT NIGHT THE NORTH FORK SUDDENLY LEAPED OVER ITS BANKS AND SWEPT UP THE TRIANGULAR VALLEY OF ROARING CAMP
GAMBLERS AND ADVENTURERS ARE GENERALLY SUPERSTITIOUS AND OAKHURST ONE DAY DECLARED THAT THE BABY HAD BROUGHT THE LUCK TO ROARING CAMP IT WAS CERTAIN THAT OF LATE THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL LUCK
AND EF THERE'S GOIN TO BE ANY GODFATHERS ROUND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHO'S GOT ANY BETTER RIGHTS THAN ME A SILENCE FOLLOWED STUMPY'S SPEECH
ME AND THAT ASS HE WOULD SAY HAS BEEN FATHER AND MOTHER TO HIM DON'T YOU HE WOULD ADD APOSTROPHIZING THE HELPLESS BUNDLE BEFORE HIM NEVER GO BACK ON US
THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP HAD DISAPPEARED THEY WERE RETURNING WITH SAD HEARTS WHEN A SHOUT FROM THE BANK RECALLED THEM IT WAS A RELIEF BOAT FROM DOWN THE RIVER THEY HAD PICKED UP THEY SAID A MAN AND AN INFANT
FOR WHETHER OWING TO THE RUDE SURGERY OF THE CAMP OR SOME OTHER REASON CHEROKEE SAL WAS SINKING FAST WITHIN AN HOUR SHE HAD CLIMBED AS IT WERE THAT RUGGED ROAD THAT LED TO THE STARS
HE UNCOVERED HOWEVER AS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
CALL HIM LUCK AND START HIM FAIR A DAY WAS ACCORDINGLY SET APART FOR THE CHRISTENING WHAT WAS MEANT BY THIS CEREMONY THE READER MAY IMAGINE WHO HAS ALREADY GATHERED SOME IDEA
THEN HE WALKED UP THE GULCH PAST THE CABIN STILL WHISTLING WITH DEMONSTRATIVE UNCONCERN
THOSE NEAREST THE DOOR AND THE CAMP STOPPED TO LISTEN ABOVE THE SWAYING AND MOANING OF THE PINES THE SWIFT RUSH OF THE RIVER AND THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE
BETS WERE FREELY OFFERED AND TAKEN REGARDING THE RESULT THREE TO FIVE THAT SAL WOULD GET THROUGH WITH IT EVEN THAT THE CHILD WOULD SURVIVE SIDE BETS AS TO THE SEX AND COMPLEXION OF THE COMING STRANGER
HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK ON HIS HEAD IN THE SOFT EARTH
A DIAMOND BREASTPIN A DIAMOND RING
BUT LITTLE COULD BE DONE TO COLLECT THE SCATTERED CAMP WHEN THE MORNING BROKE THE CABIN OF STUMPY NEAREST THE RIVER BANK WAS GONE HIGHER UP THE GULCH THEY FOUND THE BODY OF ITS UNLUCKY OWNER BUT THE PRIDE THE HOPE THE JOY
TO HIM THE BIRDS SANG THE SQUIRRELS CHATTERED AND THE FLOWERS BLOOMED NATURE WAS HIS NURSE AND PLAYFELLOW FOR HIM SHE WOULD LET SLIP BETWEEN THE LEAVES GOLDEN SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT THAT FELL JUST WITHIN HIS GRASP
AS THEY BENT OVER THE STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR THEY SAW THAT THE CHILD WAS COLD AND PULSELESS HE IS DEAD SAID ONE KENTUCK OPENED HIS EYES DEAD HE REPEATED FEEBLY YES MY MAN
THE BUMBLEBEES BUZZED AND THE ROOKS CAWED A SLUMBROUS ACCOMPANIMENT SUCH WAS THE GOLDEN SUMMER OF ROARING CAMP THEY WERE FLUSH TIMES AND THE LUCK WAS WITH THEM
THE LUCK WAS USUALLY CARRIED TO THE GULCH FROM WHENCE THE GOLDEN STORE OF ROARING CAMP WAS TAKEN THERE ON A BLANKET SPREAD OVER PINE BOUGHS HE WOULD LIE WHILE THE MEN WERE WORKING IN THE DITCHES BELOW
RASTLED WITH IT THE
THAN THE ANCIENT TREATMENT OF ROMULUS AND REMUS AND APPARENTLY AS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THESE DETAILS WERE COMPLETED WHICH EXHAUSTED ANOTHER HOUR THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE ANXIOUS CROWD OF MEN
THAT SOMETIMES WORRIED STUMPY HE WAS ALWAYS TRACTABLE AND QUIET AND IT IS RECORDED THAT ONCE HAVING CREPT BEYOND HIS CORRAL A HEDGE OF TESSELLATED PINE BOUGHS WHICH SURROUNDED HIS BED
THE CLAIMS HAD YIELDED ENORMOUSLY THE CAMP WAS JEALOUS OF ITS PRIVILEGES AND LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY ON STRANGERS NO ENCOURAGEMENT WAS GIVEN TO IMMIGRATION
BUT AFTER THE PROCESSION HAD MARCHED TO THE GROVE WITH MUSIC AND BANNERS AND THE CHILD HAD BEEN DEPOSITED BEFORE A MOCK ALTAR STUMPY STEPPED BEFORE THE EXPECTANT CROWD
GOOD AND BAD ACTIONS ARE CATCHING AS THE PROCESSION FILED IN COMMENTS WERE AUDIBLE CRITICISMS ADDRESSED PERHAPS RATHER TO STUMPY IN THE CHARACTER OF SHOWMAN IS THAT HIM MIGHTY SMALL SPECIMEN
IN FACT HE SEEMED TO ENJOY REPEATING IT
BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NOBODY SAW IT AND NOBODY LAUGHED TOMMY WAS CHRISTENED AS SERIOUSLY AS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER A CHRISTIAN ROOF AND CRIED AND WAS COMFORTED
RED DOG HAD BEEN TWICE UNDER WATER AND ROARING CAMP HAD BEEN FOREWARNED
I HESITATE TO RECORD THE MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF HIS SAGACITY WHICH REST UNFORTUNATELY UPON THE STATEMENTS OF PREJUDICED FRIENDS
SAID FANNY ALMOST FRIGHTENED AT THE PROPOSAL OF COURSE IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION FANNY SAID LUCY NOW SPEAKING RATHER SERIOUSLY IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LORD LUFTON'S HORSE IN THE SECOND PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LADY MEREDITH'S HABIT
AND NOW AS FAR AS COMFORT WAS CONCERNED SHE MUST CONFINE HERSELF TO THE LATTER SHE COULD NOT AGAIN BE COMFORTABLE IN LADY LUFTON'S DRAWING ROOM BUT THEN SHE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HERSELF WHETHER LADY LUFTON WAS NOT RIGHT
AND THEN LADY LUFTON PAUSED FOR A MOMENT FOR SHE ELOQUENT AND DISCREET AS SHE ALWAYS WAS FELT HERSELF RATHER AT A LOSS FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS HER EXACT MEANING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT HER SAID FANNY
WHY DIDN'T SHE LABEL HIM DANGEROUS IN TIME AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND UP TO THEIR OWN ROOMS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO UNDERSTAND LUCY'S STATE OF MIND AT PRESENT AND IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT HERSELF
STANDING STILL IN THE PATH AND LOOKING UP INTO HER COMPANION'S FACE WITH ALL HER EYES
THEY THEN WALKED UP TO THE HALL DOOR IN SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD REACHED IT LUCY STOOD IN THE DOORWAY INSTEAD OF ENTERING IT AND SAID FANNY LET US TAKE ANOTHER TURN TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED NO I'M NOT TIRED
THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD NOT BE PLEASED IF HE PAID YOU MARKED ATTENTIONS AND IF YOU RECEIVED THEM JUST LIKE THAT AFFAIR OF THE RIDING IT WAS BETTER TO DECLINE IT OF COURSE I DECLINED IT OF COURSE I NEVER DREAMT OF ACCEPTING SUCH AN OFFER
AND INDEED LADY LUFTON HAD A WORD OR TWO TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT ALSO ONLY NOT EXACTLY NOW A HUNTING PARSON WAS NOT AT ALL TO HER TASTE BUT THAT MATTER MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ABEYANCE FOR A FEW DAYS
AFTER I HAVE HAD SO MANY DOSES IT IS NO GOOD TELLING ME ABOUT IT NOW WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE
IF LUCY WOULD PERSIST IN SECURING TO HERSELF SO MUCH OF LORD LUFTON'S TIME AND ATTENTION HER VISITS TO FRAMLEY COURT MUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT LADY LUFTON WOULD DO MUCH VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE PARSONAGE
TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LASTLY IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER VERY GOOD REASONS NONSENSE SAID LORD LUFTON A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE SAID LUCY LAUGHING BUT ALL OF IT OF LORD LUFTON'S TALKING
SHE GOT FANNY UP INTO HER OWN DEN ONE AFTERNOON AND SEATED HER DISCREETLY IN AN EASY ARM CHAIR MAKING HER GUEST TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND SHOWING BY VARIOUS SIGNS THAT THE VISIT WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF GREAT MOMENT FANNY SHE SAID
HUNG ALMOST OVER HER ARM AND DOWN HER BACK AS THOUGH HIS HAND HAD TOUCHED AND PERHAPS RESTED ON HER SHOULDER SHE WAS STANDING BY HIS SIDE LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE WITH ONE GLOVED HAND RESTING ON THE HORSE'S NECK
NOW FANNY YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL LIKED YOUR SISTER IN LAW LUCY VERY MUCH
I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SAID FANNY SPEAKING BY NO MEANS IN A DEFIANT TONE BUT HUMBLY AS IT WERE AND DEPRECATING HER LADYSHIP'S WRATH FANNY HAD GAINED ONE SIGNAL VICTORY OVER LADY LUFTON
I DID NOT SAY THAT OR THAT I HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO FLIRT WITH ME I DID NOT MEAN TO SHOCK YOU LUCY WHAT DID YOU MEAN FANNY WHY JUST THIS
WHAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN AT GATHERUM CASTLE SHE NEVER KNEW WE HOWEVER ARE MORE INTRUSIVE LESS DELICATE IN OUR INQUIRIES AND WE CAN SAY HE HAD A VERY BAD DAY'S SPORT WITH THE WEST BARSETSHIRE
A HABIT INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER OF TAKING THE BIT BETWEEN HIS TEETH WHENEVER HE SUSPECTED INTERFERENCE DRIVE HIM GENTLY WITHOUT PULLING HIS MOUTH ABOUT AND YOU MIGHT TAKE HIM ANYWHERE ALMOST AT ANY PACE BUT A SMART TOUCH
LORD LUFTON WANTS ME TO LEARN TO RIDE SAID SHE
NEARLY OPPOSITE TO PODGENS SHOP SHE SAW LORD LUFTON ON HORSEBACK AND LUCY STANDING BESIDE HIM IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY FIVE O'CLOCK AND IT WAS GETTING DUSK BUT AS SHE APPROACHED OR RATHER
MISSUS ROBARTS AS SHE SAW THEM COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT THERE MIGHT BE CAUSE FOR LADY LUFTON'S FEARS BUT THEN LUCY'S MANNER AS MISSUS ROBARTS APPROACHED WAS CALCULATED TO DISSIPATE ANY SUCH FEARS
NOW THIS DID DISTURB LADY LUFTON NOT A LITTLE AND THEN LUCY TOOK IT ALL SO QUIETLY ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL AT FRAMLEY SHE HAD BEEN SO SHY SO SILENT
SHE MIGHT BE FOOL ENOUGH TO FANCY ANY FOLLY AND MOREOVER PEOPLE WOULD TALK WHY SHOULD HE GO TO THE PARSONAGE NOW MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE LUCY CAME THERE
THAT HER SON'S ACRES MIGHT BE PROTECTED FROM THE MILLIONNAIRES AND OTHER PHILISTINES WHY YES I DON'T EXACTLY WANT TO SEE A JEW TAILOR INVESTING HIS EARNINGS AT LUFTON SAID THE LORD HEAVEN FORBID SAID THE WIDOW
AND HER PRINCIPLES ARE UPRIGHT BUT PEOPLE WILL TALK OF HER YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT FANNY AS WELL AS I DO FANNY COULD NOT HELP MEDITATING WHETHER PROPER FEELING EDUCATION AND UPRIGHT PRINCIPLES
DID FORBID LUCY ROBARTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH LORD LUFTON BUT HER DOUBTS ON THIS SUBJECT IF SHE HELD ANY WERE NOT COMMUNICATED TO HER LADYSHIP IT HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO HER MIND
THAT LORD LUFTON WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE LUCY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEARN TO RIDE WHEREAS SHE LUCY HERSELF HAD GIVEN HER REFUSAL IN A FIRM AND DECIDED TONE AS THOUGH RESOLVED THAT NOTHING MORE SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT
WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO CREATE NO ILL FEELING AND WISHED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE AND ON GOOD TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BUT YET THE TRUTH WAS FORCED OUT OF HER WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SO SUDDENLY NOT TO LECTURE YOU LUCY
BUT YOUNG LADIES SOMETIMES ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE AND THEN TO THINK THEMSELVES VERY ILL USED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD NO IDEA IN THEIR HEAD I WILL PUT HER ON HER GUARD IF YOU WISH IT LADY LUFTON EXACTLY MY DEAR
SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW IN HAVING BEEN THUS MADE THE SUBJECT OF REMARK WITH REFERENCE TO LORD LUFTON SHE KNEW THAT HER PLEASANT EVENINGS AT FRAMLEY COURT WERE NOW OVER AND THAT SHE COULD NOT AGAIN TALK TO HIM IN AN UNRESTRAINED TONE
HAD YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE FELT ANGRY WITH LADY LUFTON WELL TO CAUTION ME
SHE HAD WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD CONVEY TO HER SISTER IN LAW AN IDEA OF WHAT LADY LUFTON WOULD DISLIKE BUT IN DOING SO SHE HAD UNINTENTIONALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HER AN ACCUSATION FLIRTING FANNY SAID LUCY
AND THE MAN GOT UP INTO A LADY'S SADDLE I THINK GREGORY WOULD MAKE A BETTER HAND OF IT THAN LUCY THE HORSE CANTERED WITH HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CARRIED A LADY ALL HIS LIFE AND HIS MOUTH IS LIKE VELVET INDEED THAT IS HIS FAULT HE IS TOO SOFT MOUTHED
SHE SAID AT LAST WELL TO PREACH TO ME OR TO TALK TO ME OR TO GIVE ME A LESSON TO SAY SOMETHING THAT SHALL DRIVE ME TO PUT MY BACK UP AGAINST LORD LUFTON TO CAUTION YOU DEAREST
THAT LADY LUFTON HAD SYMPATHIZED WITH HER AND ENCOURAGED HER SHE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MODERATE THE BLAZE OF HER OWN SPLENDOUR IN ORDER THAT LUCY'S UNACCUSTOMED EYES MIGHT NOT BE DAZZLED BUT ALL THIS WAS CHANGED NOW
WAS THE PERFECTLY COLLECTED MANNER IN WHICH LUCY SPOKE AND CONDUCTED HERSELF THIS CONNECTED AS SHE COULD NOT BUT CONNECT IT WITH THE AIR OF CHAGRIN WITH WHICH LORD LUFTON RECEIVED LUCY'S DECISION MADE IT MANIFEST TO MISSUS ROBARTS
AND WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT SHE HAD FELT THE AIR OF THE WHOLE PLACE TO BE VERY COLD BEFORE HER INTIMACY WITH HIM AND NOW IT MUST BE COLD AGAIN TWO HOMES HAD BEEN OPEN TO HER FRAMLEY COURT AND THE PARSONAGE
LUCY COULD LISTEN TO THE YOUNG LORD'S VOICE BY THE HOUR TOGETHER WITHOUT BEING DAZZLED IN THE LEAST UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO HER SHE WOULD SPEAK EITHER TO HER SON OR TO FANNY ROBARTS AND BY A LITTLE DIPLOMACY
AND SHE KNEW THE REST AS WELL AS THOUGH IT HAD ALL BEEN SPOKEN I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT FOR I AM SURE WE HAVE SHOWN IT YOU HAVE INDEED AS YOU ALWAYS DO AND YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT I AM GOING TO COMPLAIN CONTINUED LADY LUFTON
AND LADY LUFTON HAS BEEN ASKING YOU TO LECTURE ME ABOUT IT POOR MISSUS ROBARTS HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY SHE THOUGHT WELL OF ALL THE PERSONS CONCERNED AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BEHAVE WELL BY ALL OF THEM
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
MAKING USE OF THE EXCUSE COMMON ON ALL SUCH OCCASIONS THERE IS ONE OF JUSTINIA'S IN THE HOUSE I KNOW SHE ALWAYS LEAVES ONE HERE IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RIDE WHEN SHE COMES SHE WOULD NOT THINK OF TAKING SUCH A LIBERTY WITH LADY MEREDITH'S THINGS
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WITH A PRUDENCE EQUAL TO HER GENEROSITY FELT THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE SUBMISSIVE IT MIGHT PERHAPS NOT BE LONG BEFORE SHE WOULD BE EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO CONQUER AGAIN
IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND YOU AT ONCE AND THEN THEY AGAIN MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOUSE TELL ME TRULY NOW DO YOU THINK THAT LORD LUFTON AND I HAVE BEEN FLIRTING I DO THINK THAT HE IS A LITTLE INCLINED TO FLIRT WITH YOU
BUT WE ARE GETTING COLD ARE WE NOT FANNY SO WE WILL WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT AND THEN THE TWO LADIES SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND WALKED ON TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE THAT WHICH ASTONISHED MISSUS ROBARTS THE MOST IN ALL THIS
ALL THIS AS I HAVE SAID WAS VERY NICE IT WAS MANIFEST TO HER LADYSHIP FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S WAY OF TALKING THAT NO VITAL INJURY HAD AS YET BEEN DONE HE HAD NO CARES ON HIS MIND
THE COUNTY IS ALTOGETHER SHORT OF FOXES AND SOME ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE MATTER MUST TAKE THAT POINT UP BEFORE THEY CAN DO ANY GOOD AND AFTER THAT HE HAD HAD RATHER A DULL DINNER WITH THE DUKE SOWERBY HAD BEEN THERE
BUT NOT EVEN FOR THEM COULD SHE PERMIT HER SON'S PROSPECTS IN LIFE TO BE ENDANGERED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SAID BETWEEN THEM AND MISSUS ROBARTS GOT UP TO TAKE HER LEAVE HAVING PROMISED TO SPEAK TO LUCY
WHICH SHE KNEW WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THAT ORDINARY COMFORTABLE MASCULINE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF WHICH SHE HAD ONCE SATISFIED HERSELF WAS NOT FANNY RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID THAT INTIMATE FRIENDSHIPS OF THAT NATURE WERE DANGEROUS THINGS
THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TILL THEY REACHED THE PARSONAGE GATE AND THEN LUCY SAID LAUGHING CAN'T YOU FANCY ME SITTING ON THAT GREAT BIG HORSE
BUT STILL IT MAY BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY A WORD TO HER A LITTLE MANAGEMENT NOW AND THEN IN SUCH MATTERS IS SO USEFUL BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY TO HER
AND SPOKE FREELY ABOUT THE PROPERTY BUT NEVERTHELESS THERE WERE CLOUDS EVEN NOW AT THIS PERIOD OF BLISS WHICH SOMEWHAT OBSCURED THE BRILLIANCY OF LADY LUFTON'S SKY
HAVE THIS EVIL REMEDIED AND THEN SHE HAD TO DETERMINE ON WHICH STEP SHE WOULD TAKE NOTHING COULD BE MORE REASONABLE THAN LUDOVIC SO AT LEAST SHE SAID TO HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THEN LUDOVIC UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT SUCH MATTERS
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE LAND IN THE MARKET SOMETIMES SO THAT THE MILLIONNAIRES MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY GOD FORBID THAT YOURS SHOULD BE THERE AND THE WIDOW MADE A LITTLE MENTAL PRAYER
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT ANY YOUNG LADY WHO TALKS SO MUCH TO THE SAME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HER OF SETTING HER CAP AT LORD LUFTON NOT THAT I SUSPECT HER I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TOO MUCH PROPER FEELING
AS SHE CAME SUDDENLY WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM SHE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE IN CLOSE CONVERSATION LORD LUFTON'S FACE WAS TOWARDS HER AND HIS HORSE WAS STANDING STILL HE WAS LEANING OVER TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND THE WHIP WHICH HE HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND
AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF ANY INTERFERENCE NEVERTHELESS SHE AT ONCE OFFERED TO SPEAK TO LUCY I DON'T THINK THAT LUCY HAS ANY IDEA IN HER HEAD UPON THE SUBJECT SAID MISSUS ROBARTS I DARE SAY NOT I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE HAS
YOU MANAGE EVERYTHING SO PERFECTLY SAID LADY LUFTON AS SHE PRESSED MISSUS ROBARTS HAND THAT I AM QUITE AT EASE NOW THAT I FIND YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT EXACTLY AGREE WITH HER LADYSHIP
FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BE SWALLOWED IN MISTAKE YOU WILL BE SAFE YOU SEE SAID FANNY LAUGHING AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY CAUTIONED AS TO THIS INDIVIDUAL BOTTLE AH
BUT NOW SHE WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM SHE COULD NOT ASK THE PARSON AND HIS WIFE WITHOUT LUCY AND WHEN LUCY WAS THERE HER SON WOULD PASS THE GREATER PART OF THE EVENING IN TALKING TO HER OR PLAYING CHESS WITH HER
IF I THOUGHT IT HAD COME TO THAT I SHOULD RECOMMEND THAT SHE SHOULD BE SENT AWAY ALTOGETHER I AM SURE SHE IS NOT SO FOOLISH AS THAT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IN IT AT ALL LADY LUFTON I DON'T THINK THERE IS MY DEAR
AND I REGARDED IT AS A MERE COMMONPLACE POWDER GOOD FOR THE COMPLEXION I WONDER WHETHER IT'S TOO LATE OR WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANTIDOTE MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT ALWAYS QUITE UNDERSTAND HER SISTER IN LAW AND NOW SHE WAS A LITTLE AT A LOSS
I HOPE SO AND I THINK I MAY SAY I'M SURE OF IT BUT THEN IT'S ALWAYS WELL TO BE ON ONE'S GUARD YES IT IS SAID FANNY WHO KNEW THAT SOMETHING UNPLEASANT WAS COMING SOMETHING AS TO WHICH SHE MIGHT PROBABLY BE CALLED UPON TO DIFFER FROM HER LADYSHIP
BUT SHE HARDLY THOUGHT IT WORTH HER WHILE TO SAY SO MISSUS ROBARTS IMMEDIATELY STARTED OFF ON HER WALK TO HER OWN HOME AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT OUT OF THE GROUNDS INTO THE ROAD WHERE IT MAKES A TURN TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE
NOT THAT IT EVER OCCURRED TO LADY LUFTON AS POSSIBLE THAT HER SON SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH LUCY ROBARTS LUCY'S PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS WERE NOT OF A NATURE TO GIVE GROUND FOR SUCH A FEAR AS THAT BUT HE MIGHT TURN THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH HIS CHATTER
BUT YOU SEE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT SAID LUCY AS REGARDS THE HORSE YOU WILL LEARN IN TWO DAYS AND I DO HOPE YOU WILL TRY DON'T YOU THINK IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT THING FOR HER MISSUS ROBARTS LUCY HAS GOT NO HABIT SAID MISSUS ROBARTS
IT IS NOT THAT I SUSPECT ANY EVIL I DON'T THINK THAT I AM SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE
YES MY DEAR ABOUT LUCY SHE IS A VERY NICE GOOD GIRL AND A CREDIT TO HER FATHER AND A GREAT COMFORT TO US SAID FANNY I AM SURE SHE IS SHE MUST BE A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION TO YOU AND SO USEFUL ABOUT THE CHILDREN BUT
AND THEN HER LADYSHIP IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME TROUBLE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE HER INVITATIONS TO THE PARSONAGE THESE HITHERTO HAD BEEN VERY FREQUENT AND SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THINKING THAT THEY COULD HARDLY BE TOO MUCH SO
SAID FANNY BUT THEY WILL EACH OF THEM GET WRONG IDEAS ABOUT THE OTHER AND ABOUT THEMSELVES LUCY WILL PERHAPS THINK THAT LUDOVIC MEANS MORE THAN HE DOES AND LUDOVIC WILL
SHE WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS THAT THE LABEL WOULD IN TRUTH BE NOW TOO LATE THAT THE CAUTION HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE POISON HAD BEEN SWALLOWED WAS THERE ANY ANTIDOTE THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT FOR HER TO CONSIDER
SHE HAD HAD COURAGE ENOUGH AND PRESENCE OF MIND TO JOKE ABOUT THE MATTER WHEN HER SISTER IN LAW SPOKE TO HER AND YET SHE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT IT WAS NO JOKING MATTER LORD LUFTON HAD NOT ABSOLUTELY MADE LOVE TO HER BUT HE HAD LATTERLY SPOKEN TO HER IN A MANNER
AND HIS LORDSHIP GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD LIKE IT SAID FANNY I'M SURE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I WILL NOT TRY HER TEMPER IN THAT RESPECT SOMETIMES I FANCY THAT SHE DOES NOT EVEN LIKE SEEING LORD LUFTON TALKING TO ME
LET IT BE EVER SO SLIGHT WOULD BRING HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THEN IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION WHETHER YOU COULD GET HIM ANOTHER MILE THAT DAY SO THAT ON THE WHOLE LADY LUFTON THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER PLAN WOULD BE THE BEST I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT LADY LUFTON WAS RIGHT
AND NECESSARY TO MENTION AND YET IT IS A VERY DELICATE AFFAIR TO SPEAK OF FANNY OPENED HER EYES AND SAID THAT SHE HOPED THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG NO MY DEAR I THINK NOTHING IS WRONG
I WONDER WHETHER THEY CAUTIONED GRISELDA GRANTLY WHEN SHE WAS HERE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOUNG LORDS GO ABOUT ALL THE GIRLS ARE CAUTIONED AS A MATTER OF COURSE
THAT A MATCH WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN LORD LUFTON AND LUCY ROBARTS NOR HAD SHE THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO ENCOURAGE IT NOW THAT THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER ON SUCH A MATTER SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH LADY LUFTON THOUGH SHE DID NOT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HER
WHY WAS LUDOVIC SO SLOW IN THAT AFFAIR OF GRISELDA GRANTLY WHY SO OFTEN IN THESE LATTER WINTER DAYS DID HE SAUNTER OVER TO THE PARSONAGE AND THEN THAT TERRIBLE VISIT TO GATHERUM CASTLE
AND TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR THEM SHE DID NOT MOVE FROM HER POSITION OR ALLOW HER HAND TO DROP OR SHOW THAT SHE WAS IN ANY WAY EITHER CONFUSED OR CONSCIOUS SHE STOOD HER GROUND
BECAUSE I WISHED TO PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD YOU KNOW LUCY THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO FIND FAULT WITH YOU BUT YOU MAY BE SURE AS A RULE
YES LUCY VERY DANGEROUS LUCY BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT THEY WERE SO AND LYING THERE WITH SLEEPLESS EYES AND A MOIST PILLOW
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING AS A MAN BEING SOFT HEARTED SAID LUCY EXACTLY YOU OUGHT TO RIDE THEM BOTH WITH A VERY LIGHT HAND THEY ARE DIFFICULT CATTLE TO MANAGE BUT VERY PLEASANT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT
SAID FANNY NOT KNOWING WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE TO SUCH A PROPOSITION YES SAID HE THIS HORSE WOULD CARRY HER BEAUTIFULLY HE IS AS QUIET AS A LAMB AND I MADE GREGORY GO OUT WITH HIM YESTERDAY WITH A SHEET HANGING OVER HIM LIKE A LADY'S HABIT
GO RIDING ABOUT THE COUNTRY ON HIS HORSES WHAT HAVE I DONE FANNY THAT YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE SUCH A THING YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DEAREST
NEVER LET THE ESTATE DECREASE IN YOUR HANDS IT IS ONLY BY SUCH RESOLUTIONS AS THAT THAT ENGLISH NOBLEMEN AND ENGLISH GENTLEMEN CAN PRESERVE THEIR COUNTRY I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE PROPERTY CHANGING HANDS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HARM DONE YET ON EITHER SIDE SHE SAID CHEERILY AH YOU DON'T KNOW FANNY BUT I DO THINK THAT IF I DIE AS I SHALL I FEEL I SHALL AND IF SO I DO THINK IT OUGHT TO GO VERY HARD WITH LADY LUFTON
SHE DOES NOT LIKE IT LUCY WHEN SHE SEES HIM FLIRTING WITH YOU THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID RATHER GRAVELY WHEREAS LUCY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN A HALF BANTERING TONE AS SOON AS EVEN THE WORD FLIRTING WAS OUT OF FANNY'S MOUTH
AND IN THE EVENING HE AND SOWERBY HAD PLAYED BILLIARDS SOWERBY HAD WON A POUND OR TWO AND THAT HAD BEEN THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE DONE BUT THOSE SAUNTERINGS OVER TO THE PARSONAGE MIGHT BE MORE DANGEROUS
THAT IS JUST IT PUT HER ON HER GUARD THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY SHE IS A DEAR GOOD CLEVER GIRL AND IT WOULD BE VERY SAD IF ANYTHING WERE TO INTERRUPT OUR COMFORTABLE WAY OF GETTING ON WITH HER
WELL NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS SAID LADY LUFTON NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF BUT A LITTLE CHAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME MAY PERHAPS SET MATTERS RIGHT WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT BECOME TROUBLESOME IS IT ABOUT LUCY
BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT
SPEAKING WITH THE OBJECT OF ASSISTING HER LADYSHIP IN HER EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS SHE AND LORD LUFTON ARE GETTING INTO THE WAY OF BEING TOO MUCH TOGETHER OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER TOO EXCLUSIVELY
AND THEN AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT AS MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT FEEL THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY ON THE MATTER POISON SHOULD BE THE WORD WITH ANY ONE SO FATAL AS LORD LUFTON AND HE OUGHT TO BE MADE UP OF SOME PARTICULAR COLOUR
AND LUDOVIC LIKE ALL YOUNG MEN IS PERHAPS IGNORANT THAT HIS ATTENTIONS MAY BE TAKEN TO MEAN MORE THAN HE INTENDS
AND RAZUMIHIN IS NOT A MAN TO RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION MISTER ZAMETOV WAS TREMENDOUSLY STRUCK BY YOUR ANGER AND YOUR OPEN DARING THINK OF BLURTING OUT IN A RESTAURANT
I THOUGHT TOO OF YOUR ARTICLE IN THAT JOURNAL DO YOU REMEMBER ON YOUR FIRST VISIT WE TALKED OF IT
UMSONST I THOUGHT TO MYSELF NOW THAT MAN WILL COME WILL COME OF HIMSELF AND QUICKLY TOO
BUT WHAT YOU SUPPOSED THEN WAS NOT TRUE I HAD NOT SENT FOR ANYONE I HAD MADE NO KIND OF ARRANGEMENTS YOU ASK WHY I HADN'T WHAT SHALL I SAY TO YOU
EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE RODION ROMANOVITCH EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE WHY HE'S PLAYING HIS PROFESSIONAL TRICKS AGAIN RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT WITH DISGUST
THOUGH I DON'T AGREE WITH ALL YOUR CONVICTIONS I WANTED TO TELL YOU THIS FIRST FRANKLY AND QUITE SINCERELY FOR ABOVE ALL I DON'T WANT TO DECEIVE YOU WHEN I MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE I FELT ATTRACTED BY YOU PERHAPS YOU WILL LAUGH AT MY SAYING SO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO
I SEEM TO SEE IT SOMEWHERE IN A KITCHEN GARDEN IT WAS IN A KITCHEN GARDEN YOU TOLD ZAMETOV AND AFTERWARDS YOU REPEATED THAT IN MY OFFICE AND WHEN WE BEGAN PICKING YOUR ARTICLE TO PIECES HOW YOU EXPLAINED IT
I READ YOUR ARTICLE AND PUT IT ASIDE THINKING AS I DID SO THAT MAN WON'T GO THE COMMON WAY WELL I ASK YOU
IT'S SCARCELY NECESSARY TO GO OVER EVERYTHING IN DETAIL PORFIRY PETROVITCH WENT ON INDEED I COULD SCARCELY ATTEMPT IT TO BEGIN WITH THERE WERE RUMOURS THROUGH WHOM HOW AND WHEN THOSE RUMOURS CAME TO ME
HERE I HAVE NIKOLAY ON MY HANDS WITH ACTUAL EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU LIKE OF IT BUT IT'S EVIDENCE HE BRINGS IN HIS PSYCHOLOGY TOO ONE HAS TO CONSIDER HIM TOO FOR IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH WHY AM I EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU
YOUR NERVES WERE UNHINGED AND YOUR KNEES WERE SHAKING AND SO WERE MINE AND YOU KNOW OUR BEHAVIOUR WAS UNSEEMLY EVEN UNGENTLEMANLY AND YET WE ARE GENTLEMEN ABOVE ALL IN ANY CASE GENTLEMEN THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD
THAT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT AT THE TIME I WAS EXPECTING YOU BUT YOU SIMPLY BOWLED ZAMETOV OVER AND WELL YOU SEE IT ALL LIES IN THIS THAT THIS DAMNABLE PSYCHOLOGY CAN BE TAKEN TWO WAYS
HE ALWAYS GIVES AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR TO EACH PATIENT HE POSITIVELY LAUGHED LOOKING AT ME HE SOUNDED ME TOBACCO'S BAD FOR YOU HE SAID YOUR LUNGS ARE AFFECTED
HOW COULD I HELP BEING CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT FOLLOWED
WAS HERE WHEN YOU WERE LYING ILL IN BED NOT OFFICIALLY NOT IN MY OWN PERSON BUT I WAS HERE
BUT THAT WAS ONLY TO LEAD YOU ON I REPEAT RODION ROMANOVITCH YOU ARE ILL AND IMPATIENT THAT YOU WERE BOLD HEADSTRONG IN EARNEST AND HAD FELT A GREAT DEAL I RECOGNISED LONG BEFORE I TOO HAVE FELT THE SAME
I BELIEVE THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT EITHER THOSE RUMOURS AND THAT ACCIDENT LED TO ONE IDEA IN MY MIND I ADMIT IT OPENLY FOR ONE MAY AS WELL MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT I WAS THE FIRST TO PITCH ON YOU
IF YOU MAKE A MAN LOSE ALL PATIENCE THOUGH EVEN THEN IT'S RARE I WAS CAPABLE OF REALISING THAT IF I ONLY HAD A FACT I THOUGHT THE LEAST LITTLE FACT TO GO UPON SOMETHING I COULD LAY HOLD OF SOMETHING TANGIBLE NOT MERELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
I CAME TO SEE YOU THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY IN THE EVENING YOU DIDN'T KNOW PORFIRY PETROVITCH WENT ON LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM I CAME INTO THIS VERY ROOM I WAS PASSING BY JUST AS I DID TO DAY AND I THOUGHT I'D RETURN YOUR CALL
WHAT IS HE UP TO WHAT DOES HE TAKE ME FOR RASKOLNIKOV ASKED HIMSELF IN AMAZEMENT
HOW COULD I AVOID BEING BROUGHT TO CERTAIN IDEAS FROM A HUNDRED RABBITS YOU CAN'T MAKE A HORSE A HUNDRED SUSPICIONS DON'T MAKE A PROOF AS THE ENGLISH PROVERB SAYS BUT THAT'S ONLY FROM THE RATIONAL POINT OF VIEW YOU CAN'T HELP BEING PARTIAL FOR AFTER ALL A LAWYER IS ONLY HUMAN
WHAT IS THERE TO TAKE ITS PLACE I DON'T DRINK
RASKOLNIKOV MUTTERED AT LAST ASKING THE QUESTION WITHOUT THINKING WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT HE WONDERED DISTRACTEDLY DOES HE REALLY TAKE ME TO BE INNOCENT WHAT AM I DRIVING AT I'VE COME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
IT'S OUT OF PROPORTION WITH OTHER QUALITIES OF YOUR HEART AND CHARACTER WHICH I FLATTER MYSELF I HAVE TO SOME EXTENT DIVINED OF COURSE I DID REFLECT EVEN THEN THAT IT DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT A MAN GETS UP AND BLURTS OUT HIS WHOLE STORY IT DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
ANOTHER MAN WOULDN'T BUT HE WILL AND YOU REMEMBER HOW MISTER RAZUMIHIN BEGAN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT WITH YOU
OUR FIRST INTERVIEW TOO WAS A STRANGE ONE BUT THEN AND ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER THIS IS THE POINT I HAVE PERHAPS ACTED UNFAIRLY TO YOU I FEEL IT
THE OLD WOMAN'S NOTES ON THE PLEDGES AND THE REST OF IT THAT ALL CAME TO NOTHING YOURS WAS ONE OF A HUNDRED I HAPPENED TOO TO HEAR OF THE SCENE AT THE OFFICE FROM A MAN WHO DESCRIBED IT CAPITALLY UNCONSCIOUSLY REPRODUCING THE SCENE WITH GREAT VIVIDNESS
I'VE DECIDED OPENNESS IS BETTER BETWEEN US PORFIRY PETROVITCH WENT ON TURNING HIS HEAD AWAY AND DROPPING HIS EYES AS THOUGH UNWILLING TO DISCONCERT HIS FORMER VICTIM AND AS THOUGH DISDAINING HIS FORMER WILES YES SUCH SUSPICIONS AND SUCH SCENES CANNOT CONTINUE FOR LONG
YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL IN ANOTHER SENSE IF YOU LIKE AND IT'S MORE NATURAL SO INDEED I COULDN'T HELP ADMITTING IT WAS MORE NATURAL I WAS BOTHERED NO I'D BETTER GET HOLD OF SOME LITTLE FACT I SAID
COME I THOUGHT EVEN IF I LET ONE THING SLIP FOR A TIME I SHALL GET HOLD OF SOMETHING ELSE I SHAN'T LOSE WHAT I WANT ANYWAY YOU ARE NERVOUSLY IRRITABLE RODION ROMANOVITCH BY TEMPERAMENT
THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND AND NOT BLAME MY MALICIOUS BEHAVIOUR ON THAT OCCASION
YOUR ARTICLE IS ABSURD AND FANTASTIC BUT THERE'S A TRANSPARENT SINCERITY A YOUTHFUL INCORRUPTIBLE PRIDE AND THE DARING OF DESPAIR IN IT IT'S A GLOOMY ARTICLE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S FINE IN IT
I JEERED AT YOU THEN BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT AS A LITERARY AMATEUR I AM AWFULLY FOND OF SUCH FIRST ESSAYS FULL OF THE HEAT OF YOUTH THERE IS A MISTINESS AND A CHORD VIBRATING IN THE MIST
I SAW IT ALL PLAIN AS DAYLIGHT BUT IF I HADN'T EXPECTED YOU SO SPECIALLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING IN YOUR LAUGHTER YOU SEE WHAT INFLUENCE A MOOD HAS MISTER RAZUMIHIN THEN AH THAT STONE THAT STONE UNDER WHICH THE THINGS WERE HIDDEN
I WALKED IN AS YOUR DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN I LOOKED ROUND WAITED AND WENT OUT WITHOUT LEAVING MY NAME WITH YOUR SERVANT DON'T YOU LOCK YOUR DOOR RASKOLNIKOV'S FACE GREW MORE AND MORE GLOOMY
I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY SO TO SPEAK I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU HOW THE WHOLE BUSINESS THE WHOLE MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE I'VE CAUSED YOU A GREAT DEAL OF SUFFERING RODION ROMANOVITCH
ONE MAY RECKON UPON MOST SURPRISING RESULTS INDEED I WAS RECKONING ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT RODION ROMANOVITCH ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT ABOVE ALL THINGS I HAD GREAT HOPES OF YOU AT THAT TIME BUT WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT NOW
MY HEART WAS FAIRLY THROBBING ACH NOW WHY NEED YOU HAVE COME
YOU KNOW I AM A COWARD I WENT LATELY TO DOCTOR
WHAT IS THERE IN IT I REFLECTED THERE'S NOTHING IN IT THAT IS REALLY NOTHING AND PERHAPS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND IT'S NOT AT ALL THE THING FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO LET HIMSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY NOTIONS
I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MUST MEAN FOR A MAN WHO HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT WHO IS PROUD IMPERIOUS AND ABOVE ALL IMPATIENT TO HAVE TO BEAR SUCH TREATMENT I REGARD YOU IN ANY CASE AS A MAN OF NOBLE CHARACTER AND NOT WITHOUT ELEMENTS OF MAGNANIMITY
NIKOLAY PUT A STOP TO IT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO THAT DAMNED WORKMAN WAS SITTING AT THE TIME IN THE NEXT ROOM CAN YOU REALISE THAT YOU KNOW THAT OF COURSE
AND HOW THEY AFFECTED YOU I NEED NOT GO INTO MY SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED BY A COMPLETE ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT JUST AS EASILY NOT HAVE HAPPENED
PORFIRY SEEMED TO GUESS HIS STATE OF MIND I'VE COME TO HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU RODION ROMANOVITCH MY DEAR FELLOW I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION AND MUST GIVE IT TO YOU HE CONTINUED WITH A SLIGHT SMILE JUST PATTING RASKOLNIKOV'S KNEE
I SPEAK SINCERELY PORFIRY PETROVITCH MADE A DIGNIFIED PAUSE RASKOLNIKOV FELT A RUSH OF RENEWED ALARM THE THOUGHT THAT PORFIRY BELIEVED HIM TO BE INNOCENT BEGAN TO MAKE HIM UNEASY
AH THESE CIGARETTES PORFIRY PETROVITCH EJACULATED AT LAST HAVING LIGHTED ONE THEY ARE PERNICIOUS POSITIVELY PERNICIOUS AND YET I CAN'T GIVE THEM UP I COUGH
ONE COULD TAKE EVERY WORD OF YOURS IN TWO SENSES AS THOUGH THERE WERE ANOTHER MEANING HIDDEN SO IN THIS WAY RODION ROMANOVITCH I REACHED THE FURTHEST LIMIT AND KNOCKING MY HEAD AGAINST A POST I PULLED MYSELF UP ASKING MYSELF WHAT I WAS ABOUT AFTER ALL I SAID
BUT ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT A SERIOUS AND CAREWORN LOOK CAME INTO HIS FACE TO HIS SURPRISE RASKOLNIKOV SAW A TOUCH OF SADNESS IN IT HE HAD NEVER SEEN AND NEVER SUSPECTED SUCH AN EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE
I HAD SCARCELY SENT FOR THE PORTERS YOU NOTICED THEM AS YOU WENT OUT I DARE SAY AN IDEA FLASHED UPON ME
ON THIS STARLIGHT NIGHT MISTER VENUS
LIVING ON THE MYSTERIOUS PREMISES ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE WHERE HE FOUND THINGS OR FOR INSTANCE HOW HE SET ABOUT IT
AND AS IT IS NOT THE CUE OF MISTER WEGG TO HAVE HIM OUT OF TEMPER THE LATTER GENTLEMAN SOOTHINGLY REMARKS I ONLY PUT IT AS A LITTLE CASE
MISTER WEGG NEXT MODESTLY REMARKS ON THE WANT OF ADAPTATION IN A WOODEN LEG TO LADDERS AND SUCH LIKE AIRY PERCHES AND ALSO HINTS AT AN INHERENT TENDENCY IN THAT TIMBER FICTION WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF A PROMENADE ON AN ASHEY SLOPE
PRODDED I SHOULD SAY NEITHER MISTER WEGG AS A FELLOW MAN MISTER VENUS MIX AGAIN WHY NEITHER BECAUSE I SUPPOSE SIR THAT WHAT WAS FOUND WAS FOUND IN THE SORTING AND SIFTING ALL THE MOUNDS ARE SORTED AND SIFTED YOU SHALL SEE EM
MISTER VENUS PASSIVELY WINKING HIS WEAK EYES BOTH AT ONCE DEMANDS WHAT IS MISTER WEGG THE FRIENDLY MOVE SIR THAT I NOW PROPOSE YOU SEE THE MOVE SIR TILL YOU HAVE POINTED IT OUT MISTER WEGG I CAN'T SAY WHETHER I DO OR NOT
ON THIS STARLIGHT NIGHT TO THINK THAT TALKING OVER STRANGERS AND UNDERHANDED MINDS CAN GO WALKING HOME UNDER THE SKY AS IF THEY WAS ALL SQUARE THE SPECTACLE OF THOSE ORBS SAYS MISTER VENUS GAZING UPWARD WITH HIS HAT TUMBLING OFF
I AM SO SOURED YES BUT HANG IT SAYS WEGG ARGUMENTATIVELY A WELL GOVERNED MIND CAN BE SOURED SITTING AND AS TO BEING REGARDED IN LIGHTS THERE'S BUMPEY LIGHTS AS WELL AS BONY IN WHICH AGAIN RUBBING HIS HEAD I OBJECT TO REGARD MYSELF I'LL BEAR IT IN MEMORY SIR
IF YOU'LL BE SO GOOD MISTER WEGG SLOWLY SUBDUES HIS IRONICAL TONE AND HIS LINGERING IRRITATION AND RESUMES HIS PIPE WE WERE TALKING OF OLD MISTER HARMON BEING A FRIEND OF YOURS NOT A FRIEND MISTER WEGG ONLY KNOWN TO SPEAK TO
MISTER WEGG TILTS OVER ON HIS BACK CHAIR AND ALL AND IS RESCUED BY THAT HARMLESS MISANTHROPE IN A DISJOINTED STATE AND RUEFULLY RUBBING HIS HEAD WHY YOU LOST YOUR BALANCE MISTER WEGG SAYS VENUS HANDING HIM HIS PIPE
WHETHER I GAVE MYSELF UP TO PRODDING OR WHETHER I GAVE MYSELF UP TO SCOOPING I COULDN'T DO IT WITH THAT DELICATE TOUCH SO AS NOT TO SHOW THAT I WAS DISTURBING THE MOUNDS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH YOU GOING TO WORK AS YOU WOULD IN THE LIGHT OF A FELLOW MAN HOLILY PLEDGED IN A FRIENDLY MOVE TO HIS BROTHER MAN
AND THEN FOLDS THEM PENDING A REPLY MISTER VENUS WINKS AT HIM WITH BOTH EYES SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE SPEAKING I SEE YOU HAVE TRIED IT BY YOURSELF MISTER WEGG HE SAYS WHEN HE DOES SPEAK YOU HAVE FOUND OUT THE DIFFICULTIES BY EXPERIENCE
AS ONE THAT THE POET MIGHT HAVE HAD HIS EYE ON IN WRITING THE NATIONAL NAVAL WORDS HELM A WEATHER NOW LAY HER CLOSE YARD ARM AND YARD ARM SHE LIES AGAIN CRIED I MISTER VENUS GIVE HER T'OTHER DOSE MAN SHROUDS AND GRAPPLE SIR OR SHE FLIES

I HAVE ONLY A MESSAGE FOR YOU WHICH I UNDERTOOK TO DELIVER ON MY WAY HOME TO MY LODGINGS I WAS IN TWO MINDS ABOUT COMING BEYOND THE GATE WITHOUT RINGING NOT KNOWING BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE A DOG ABOUT I WISH I HAD MUTTERS WEGG WITH HIS BACK TURNED AS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
IT BEING SO HERE IS SATURDAY EVENING COME AND HERE IS MISTER VENUS COME AND RINGING AT THE BOWER GATE MISTER WEGG OPENS THE GATE DESCRIES A SORT OF BROWN PAPER TRUNCHEON UNDER MISTER VENUS'S ARM AND REMARKS IN A DRY TONE
THEY SOFTLY BREAK OFF LIGHT THEIR PIPES WHICH HAVE GONE OUT AND LEAN BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS NO DOUBT A FOOTSTEP IT APPROACHES THE WINDOW AND A HAND TAPS AT THE GLASS COME IN CALLS WEGG MEANING COME ROUND BY THE DOOR
SIMILARLY RESUMES WEGG I HAVE OBSERVATIONS AS I CAN OFFER UPON CERTAIN POINTS AND PARTIES BUT I MAKE NO OBJECTIONS MISTER VENUS HERE IS AN IMMENSE FORTUNE DROPS FROM THE CLOUDS UPON A PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR ME IF I COULD SEE THINGS IN THE CALM LIGHT YOU DO MISTER WEGG AGAIN LOOK HERE
AND YOU MAY PERHAPS SAY MERITING TO BE PROMOTED HIGHER MISTER VENUS MURMURS THAT HE DOES SAY SO HIM THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES PASSES ME BY AND PUTS A TALKING OVER STRANGER ABOVE MY HEAD WHICH OF US TWO IS THE BETTER MAN
THEY ARE BUT SECRECY FIDELITY AND PERSEVERANCE THE BOWER TO BE ALWAYS FREE OF ACCESS TO MISTER VENUS FOR HIS RESEARCHES AND EVERY PRECAUTION TO BE TAKEN AGAINST THEIR ATTRACTING OBSERVATION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE'S A FOOTSTEP EXCLAIMS VENUS WHERE CRIES WEGG STARTING
YES SIR RETURNS VENUS ALL THE WORLD MAY DEEM IT HARSH BUT I'D QUITE AS SOON PITCH INTO MY BEST FRIEND AS NOT INDEED I'D SOONER INVOLUNTARILY MAKING A PASS WITH HIS WOODEN LEG TO GUARD HIMSELF AS MISTER VENUS SPRINGS UP IN THE EMPHASIS OF THIS UNSOCIABLE DECLARATION
AS INQUISITIVE AS SECRET AH YOU FOUND HIM SECRET RETURNS WEGG WITH A GREEDY RELISH
WHICH OF US IS THE BETTER MAN NOT THE PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS THAT'S AN OBSERVATION OF MINE BUT I DON'T MAKE IT AN OBJECTION I TAKE MY ALLOWANCE AND MY CERTAIN WEIGHT OF COALS HE TAKES HIS FORTUNE THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS
AND THE BUYER WOULD GET WHAT HE WAS NEVER MEANT TO HAVE AND NEVER BOUGHT AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE MISTER VENUS BUT THE CAUSE OF THE WRONG SAY IT WAS PAPERS MISTER VENUS PROPOUNDS ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY CONTAINED WE SHOULD OFFER TO DISPOSE OF EM TO THE PARTIES MOST INTERESTED
FOR I TELL YOU CANDIDLY I DON'T LIKE YOUR LITTLE CASES ARRIVED BY THIS TIME IN MISTER WEGG'S SITTING ROOM MADE BRIGHT ON THE CHILLY EVENING BY GASLIGHT AND FIRE MISTER VENUS SOFTENS AND COMPLIMENTS HIM ON HIS ABODE PROFITING BY THE OCCASION TO REMIND WEGG THAT HE VENUS
AND YOU'RE NATURALLY OF A POLITE DISPOSITION YOU ARE THIS LAST CLAUSE AS A SOFTENING COMPLIMENT TO MISTER VENUS IT IS TRUE SIR REPLIES VENUS WINKING HIS WEAK EYES AND RUNNING HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS DUSTY SHOCK OF HAIR THAT I WAS SO BEFORE A CERTAIN OBSERVATION SOURED ME
ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF SMALL INDICATIONS LEADING HIM ON TO THE DISCOVERY OF GREAT CONCEALMENTS WHILE AS TO MYSELF SAYS WEGG
MISTER BOFFIN WISHES YOU TO KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT EXPECT YOU TO STAY AT HOME ANY EVENING ON THE CHANCE OF HIS COMING IT HAS OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MAY WITHOUT INTENDING IT HAVE BEEN A TIE UPON YOU IN FUTURE IF HE SHOULD COME WITHOUT NOTICE HE WILL TAKE HIS CHANCE OF FINDING YOU
AND YET SIR HE PURSUES
SINCE I CALLED UPON YOU THAT EVENING WHEN YOU WERE AS I MAY SAY FLOATING YOUR POWERFUL MIND IN TEA I HAVE FELT THAT YOU REQUIRED TO BE ROUSED WITH AN OBJECT IN THIS FRIENDLY MOVE SIR YOU WILL HAVE A GLORIOUS OBJECT TO ROUSE YOU
SAY YES WEGG NATURALLY URGES IF I WASN'T SOURED MY ANSWER WOULD BE NO
NO MISTER WEGG REPLIES VENUS I AM NOT ABOVE A PARCEL ABOVE A PARCEL NO SAYS WEGG WITH SOME DISSATISFACTION BUT DOES NOT OPENLY GROWL A CERTAIN SORT OF PARCEL MIGHT BE ABOVE YOU
HE WAS THE SPECIES OF OLD GENTLEMAN SIR SLOWLY RETURNS THAT PRACTICAL ANATOMIST AFTER DRINKING
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE FOUND ON THESE PREMISES LET US FIND IT TOGETHER LET US MAKE THE FRIENDLY MOVE OF AGREEING TO LOOK FOR IT TOGETHER LET US MAKE THE FRIENDLY MOVE OF AGREEING TO SHARE THE PROFITS OF IT EQUALLY BETWIXT US IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT THUS SILAS ASSUMING A NOBLE AIR
TOLD HIM HE HAD GOT INTO A GOOD THING TOLERABLE WEGG REJOINS BUT BEAR IN MIND MISTER VENUS THAT THERE'S NO GOLD WITHOUT ITS ALLOY
SAY IT WAS MONEY OR PLATE OR JEWELLERY IT WOULD BE AS MUCH OURS AS ANYBODY ELSE'S MISTER VENUS RUBS AN EYEBROW INTERROGATIVELY IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT IT WOULD
SAYS WEGG HOLDING MISTER VENUS'S PALM OUT FLAT AND READY FOR SMITING AND NOW SMITING IT AS SUCH AND NO OTHER FOR I SCORN ALL LOWLIER TIES BETWIXT MYSELF AND THE MAN WALKING WITH HIS FACE ERECT THAT ALONE I CALL MY TWIN REGARDED AND REGARDING IN THIS TRUSTFUL BOND
MISTER VENUS IT AIN'T THAT I OBJECT TO BEING PASSED OVER FOR A STRANGER THOUGH I REGARD THE STRANGER AS A MORE THAN DOUBTFUL CUSTOMER IT AIN'T FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING MONEY THOUGH MONEY IS EVER WELCOME IT AIN'T FOR MYSELF THOUGH I AM NOT SO HAUGHTY AS TO BE ABOVE DOING MYSELF A GOOD TURN IT'S FOR THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT
SINGULAR LOOK A DOUBLE LOOK YOU MEAN SIR REJOINS WEGG PLAYING BITTERLY UPON THE WORD
WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO SAY FURTHER I WOULDN'T SAY MORE THAN FURTHER IF I WAS YOU MISTER WEGG SUGGESTS PACIFICALLY
AS A LEGAL POINT ASKS VENUS AS A LEGAL POINT
MYSTERY RETURNS WEGG I DON'T LIKE IT MISTER VENUS I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE THE LIFE KNOCKED OUT OF FORMER INHABITANTS OF THIS HOUSE IN THE GLOOMY DARK AND NOT KNOW WHO DID IT MIGHT YOU HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS MISTER WEGG NO RETURNS THAT GENTLEMAN
HE OBSERVES WITH A VAGUELY PIOUS AIR WAS SURELY NEVER MEANT FOR NOTHING LASTLY HE RETURNS TO THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT GLOOMILY FORESHADOWING THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING BEING UNEARTHED TO CRIMINATE MISTER BOFFIN
YOU COULD HAVE KEPT THIS ARTICLE BACK FROM ME I ONLY THROW IT OUT AS A LEGAL POINT DO YOU THINK SO MISTER WEGG I BOUGHT YOU IN OPEN CONTRACT YOU CAN'T BUY HUMAN FLESH AND BLOOD IN THIS COUNTRY SIR NOT ALIVE YOU CAN'T SAYS WEGG SHAKING HIS HEAD
IT IS BUT A SUPPOSITION MISTER WEGG AS A BEING WITH HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART CRIES WEGG AND THE APOSTROPHE IS NOT THE LESS IMPRESSIVE FOR THE BEING'S HAND BEING ACTUALLY UPON HIS RUM AND WATER PUT YOUR SUPPOSITION INTO LANGUAGE AND BRING IT OUT MISTER VENUS
I KNOW WHO PROFITS BY IT BUT I'VE NO SUSPICIONS HAVING SAID WHICH MISTER WEGG SMOKES AND LOOKS AT THE FIRE WITH A MOST DETERMINED EXPRESSION OF CHARITY AS IF HE HAD CAUGHT THAT CARDINAL VIRTUE BY THE SKIRTS AS SHE FELT IT HER PAINFUL DUTY TO DEPART FROM HIM AND HELD HER BY MAIN FORCE
AH WITH ANOTHER ROLL OF HIS EYES AS TO WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE DUST NOW
VENUS ASKS SOMETHING AGAINST HIM REPEATS WEGG SOMETHING
OLD REMEMBRANCES OF WHAT SIR MISTER VENUS BEGINS DREARILY REPLYING
THE QUALIFICATIONS OF MISTER VENUS FOR SUCH A SEARCH HE EXPATIATES ON MISTER VENUS'S PATIENT HABITS AND DELICATE MANIPULATION ON HIS SKILL IN PIECING LITTLE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS TISSUES AND TEXTURES
OF WHOM HE ONCE MORE CANDIDLY ADMITS IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT HE PROFITS BY A MURDER AND ANTICIPATING HIS DENUNCIATION BY THE FRIENDLY MOVERS TO AVENGING JUSTICE AND THIS MISTER WEGG EXPRESSLY POINTS OUT NOT AT ALL FOR THE SAKE OF THE REWARD
BUT UPON A POINT OF FACT I THINK MYSELF COMPETENT TO SPEAK
WEGG JOYFULLY REPRODUCES THE TWO GLASSES REPEATS THE CEREMONY OF CLINKING THEIR RIMS AND INWARDLY DRINKS WITH GREAT HEARTINESS TO THE HEALTH AND SUCCESS IN LIFE OF THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAS REDUCED MISTER VENUS TO HIS PRESENT CONVENIENT STATE OF MIND THE ARTICLES OF THE FRIENDLY MOVE ARE THEN SEVERALLY RECITED AND AGREED UPON
YOU UNDERSTAND TO WHAT I ALLUDE MISTER WEGG TO A CERTAIN WRITTEN STATEMENT RESPECTING NOT WISHING TO BE REGARDED IN A CERTAIN LIGHT SINCE THAT ALL IS FLED SAVE GALL NOT ALL SAYS MISTER WEGG IN A TONE OF SENTIMENTAL CONDOLENCE
NO IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THAT I HAVE TRIED IT REPLIES WEGG A LITTLE DASHED BY THE HINT
GOOD EVENING MISTER WEGG THE YARD GATE LOCK SHOULD BE LOOKED TO IF YOU PLEASE IT DON'T CATCH IS IT MISTER ROKESMITH FALTERS WEGG IT IS MISTER ROKESMITH DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOU I AM NOT COMING IN
AND ABOUT TIME TO DO IT GRUMBLES SILAS WHEN A MAN'S VISITORS WITHOUT A WORD OF NOTICE CONDUCT THEMSELVES WITH THE SUDDEN WICIOUSNESS OF JACKS IN BOXES
HE MOST LIKELY MADE A GOOD MANY WILLS AND CODICILS THE PALM OF SILAS WEGG DESCENDS WITH A SOUNDING SMACK UPON THE PALM OF VENUS AND WEGG LAVISHLY EXCLAIMS TWIN IN OPINION EQUALLY WITH FEELING MIX A LITTLE MORE
THE LATTER HAVING AN UNDIGNIFIED TENDENCY TO TILT HIM BACK IN HIS CHAIR HERE'S ANOTHER OBSERVATION MISTER VENUS UNACCOMPANIED WITH AN OBJECTION HIM THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS LIABLE TO BE TALKED OVER HE GETS TALKED OVER
EVERYTHING SEE INTO WHAT WONDERFUL MAUDLIN REFUGES FEATHERLESS OSTRICHES PLUNGE THEIR HEADS IT IS SUCH UNSPEAKABLE MORAL COMPENSATION TO WEGG TO BE OVERCOME BY THE CONSIDERATION THAT MISTER ROKESMITH HAS AN UNDERHANDED MIND
WHICH OF US TWO CAN REPEAT MOST POETRY WHICH OF US TWO HAS IN THE SERVICE OF HIM THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS TACKLED THE ROMANS BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY TILL HE HAS GOT AS HUSKY AS IF HE'D BEEN WEANED AND EVER SINCE BROUGHT UP ON SAWDUST NOT THE TALKING OVER STRANGER
IT WOULD BE KEPT A SECRET BY YOU AND ME
THAT IS TO SAY REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF TRUE BRITISH OAK FOR SUCH YOU ARE EXPLAIN MISTER VENUS THE EXPRESSION PAPERS SEEING THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS GENERALLY CUTTING OFF SOME NEAR RELATION OR BLOCKING OUT SOME NATURAL AFFECTION MISTER VENUS REJOINS
WHETHER HE PRODDED MISTER WEGG'S PANTOMIME IS SKILFUL AND EXPRESSIVE HERE OR WHETHER HE SCOOPED
EVEN THOUGH THE VISITOR HAD ENTERED IN THE USUAL MANNER BUT LEANING ON THE BREAST HIGH WINDOW AND STARING IN OUT OF THE DARKNESS THEY FIND THE VISITOR EXTREMELY EMBARRASSING ESPECIALLY MISTER VENUS WHO REMOVES HIS PIPE DRAWS BACK HIS HEAD AND STARES AT THE STARER AS IF IT WERE HIS OWN HINDOO BABY COME TO FETCH HIM HOME
SKIMMED IT AND FOUND NOTHING BESIDES THE DIFFICULTIES WEGG SHAKES HIS HEAD I SCARCELY KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS MISTER WEGG
BUT THE HEAVY OLD FASHIONED SASH IS SLOWLY RAISED AND A HEAD SLOWLY LOOKS IN OUT OF THE DARK BACKGROUND OF NIGHT PRAY IS MISTER SILAS WEGG HERE OH I SEE HIM THE FRIENDLY MOVERS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN QUITE AT THEIR EASE
MAYBE PAPERS AS ONE THAT WAS EVER AN ORNAMENT TO HUMAN LIFE SAYS MISTER WEGG AGAIN HOLDING OUT MISTER VENUS'S PALM AS IF HE WERE GOING TO TELL HIS FORTUNE BY CHIROMANCY AND HOLDING HIS OWN UP READY FOR SMITING IT WHEN THE TIME SHOULD COME
AND PEEPED IN FROM CURIOSITY DID YOU SEE ANYTHING NOTHING BUT THE DUST YARD MISTER WEGG ROLLS HIS EYES ALL ROUND THE ROOM IN THAT EVER UNSATISFIED QUEST OF HIS AND THEN ROLLS HIS EYES ALL ROUND MISTER VENUS AS IF SUSPICIOUS OF HIS HAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HIM TO BE FOUND OUT
REPLIES WEGG PROMPTLY IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT MISTER WEGG ALWAYS SO MISTER VENUS IF THE PARTIES SHOULD USE THEM IN THE CAUSE OF THE WRONG THAT WOULD BE THEIR ACT AND DEED MISTER VENUS I HAVE AN OPINION OF YOU SIR TO WHICH IT IS NOT EASY TO GIVE MOUTH
AND IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME TO HIM IF HE DOES NOT I UNDERTOOK TO TELL YOU ON MY WAY THAT'S ALL WITH THAT AND GOOD NIGHT THE SECRETARY LOWERS THE WINDOW AND DISAPPEARS THEY LISTEN AND HEAR HIS FOOTSTEPS GO BACK TO THE GATE AND HEAR THE GATE CLOSE AFTER HIM
THOUGH IT WOULD BE A WANT OF PRINCIPLE NOT TO TAKE IT TO ALL THIS MISTER VENUS WITH HIS SHOCK OF DUSTY HAIR COCKED AFTER THE MANNER OF A TERRIER'S EARS ATTENDS PROFOUNDLY WHEN MISTER WEGG HAVING FINISHED OPENS HIS ARMS WIDE AS IF TO SHOW MISTER VENUS HOW BARE HIS BREAST IS
YOU NEEDN'T REPEAT EM SAYS WEGG PRESSING HIS HAND BUT THINK HOW THOSE STARS STEADY ME IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT AGAINST SOME THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IT ISN'T THAT I BEAR MALICE BUT SEE HOW THEY GLISTEN WITH OLD REMEMBRANCES
I AM BUT AN INDIFFERENT PERFORMER SIR RETURNS THE OTHER BUT I'LL ACCOMPANY YOU WITH A WHIFF OR TWO AT INTERVALS SO MISTER VENUS MIXES AND WEGG MIXES AND MISTER VENUS LIGHTS AND PUFFS AND WEGG LIGHTS AND PUFFS AND THERE'S ALLOY EVEN IN THIS METAL OF YOURS MISTER WEGG YOU WAS REMARKING
I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW HOW THE POINT OF LAW MAY STAND BUT I'M THOROUGHLY CONFIDENT UPON THE POINT OF FACT
HUSH THE TALKING OVER STRANGER MISTER VENUS IS THAT ANY ONE I KNOW INQUIRES THE STARING SECRETARY NO MISTER ROKESMITH FRIEND OF MINE PASSING THE EVENING WITH ME OH I BEG HIS PARDON
TO STICK ITSELF INTO THE YIELDING FOOTHOLD AND PEG ITS OWNER TO ONE SPOT THEN LEAVING THIS PART OF THE SUBJECT HE REMARKS ON THE SPECIAL PHENOMENON THAT BEFORE HIS INSTALLATION IN THE BOWER IT WAS FROM MISTER VENUS THAT HE FIRST HEARD OF THE LEGEND OF HIDDEN WEALTH IN THE MOUNDS WHICH
AND FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL MISTER VENUS REMARKS WEGG WHEN HE IS FULLY GONE I HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM
AND PASS YOUR OPINION MIX AGAIN ON EACH OCCASION OF HIS SAYING MIX AGAIN MISTER WEGG WITH A HOP ON HIS WOODEN LEG HITCHES HIS CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER MORE AS IF HE WERE PROPOSING THAT HIMSELF AND MISTER VENUS SHOULD MIX AGAIN THAN THAT THEY SHOULD REPLENISH THEIR GLASSES
FEAR NOT THE DARKNESS I AM HERE SAID GENJI SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT TIMIDLY PRAY DO NOT THINK ME PRESUMPTUOUS SAID GENJI BUT MAY I BEG YOU TO TRANSMIT THIS POETICAL EFFUSION TO YOUR MISTRESS FOR ME
IT MIGHT NOT GRATIFY YOU THE LATE LORD AZECHI DAINAGON DIED LONG AGO AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM WELL HIS WIDOW IS MY SISTER AND SINCE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH HER HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY
THE DEER TOO WHICH WERE TO BE SEEN HERE ADDED TO THE BEAUTY OF THE PICTURE GAZING AROUND AT THESE GENJI ONCE MORE PROCEEDED TO THE TEMPLE
I KNOW NOT HOW IT CAME TO PASS BUT SHE BECAME SECRETLY INTIMATE
GENJI WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY LAUGHINGLY SAID AH SHE IS A WOMAN WHO IS LIKELY TO BECOME THE QUEEN OF THE BLUE MAIN IN VERY TRUTH HER FATHER MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING
MIGHT BE HEARD FROM AFAR BROKEN AND INDISTINCT ONE MIGHT HEAR THE MELANCHOLY SOUND OF THE SLEEPY INTONATION OF PRAYERS EVEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SORROW OF THEIR OWN OFTEN FEEL MELANCHOLY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE PLACED
BUT SHE IS EXTREMELY YOUNG HOWEVER EVERY WOMAN GROWS UP UNDER THE PROTECTING CARE OF SOME ONE AND SO I CANNOT SAY MUCH ABOUT HER ONLY IT SHALL BE MENTIONED TO MY SISTER
THE CONTOUR OF THE CHILD LIKE FOREHEAD AND OF THE SMALL AND GRACEFUL HEAD WAS VERY PLEASING GENJI AS HE SURVEYED THE SCENE FROM WITHOUT THOUGHT WITHIN HIMSELF IF SHE IS THUS FAIR IN HER GIRLHOOD WHAT WILL SHE BE WHEN SHE IS GROWN UP
AND HE TOO WAS A MAN OF GAY HABITS WHICH GAVE OCCASION TO ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS TO OBSERVE AH PERHAPS YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISAPPOINT THE HOPES OF THE AGED FATHER ANOTHER SAID WELL OUR FRIEND HAS GIVEN US A LONG ACCOUNT
I E BUDDHIST BIBLE ON HER ARM STOOL PROCEEDED TO READ IT SHE SEEMED TO BE RATHER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD HER FACE WAS RATHER ROUND AND HER APPEARANCE WAS NOBLE HER HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD
SHOULD BE SEIZED WITH AN ARDENT DESIRE TO POSSESS HER SHE WOULD NOT LONG REMAIN UNATTACHED WHAT POSSIBLE OBJECT COULD IT SERVE IF SHE WERE CARRIED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THE NATIVES OF THE DEEP WOULD DERIVE NO PLEASURE FROM HER CHARMS
WHILE HE HIMSELF PROCEEDED TO PERFORM SOME MYSTERIOUS RITE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS CEREMONY THE SUN ROSE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS GENJI MEANTIME WALKED OUT OF THE CAVE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH HIS ATTENDANTS THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WAS VERY LOFTY
HOW WOULD IT BE IF I HAD FREE CONTROL OVER HER AND HAD HER BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED ACCORDING TO MY OWN NOTIONS SO THINKING HE PROCEEDED TO SAY HOW SAD IT WAS THAT SHE DIED DID SHE LEAVE ANY OFFSPRING SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD AT HER DEATH
SOME OF THEM DESCRIBED TO HIM FUJI YAMA WHILE OTHERS TOLD HIM OF OTHER MOUNTAINS
WAS DEPRIVED BY DEATH OF MY BEST FRIEND MY MOTHER AND THE YEARS AND MONTHS WHICH THEN ROLLED BY WERE FRAUGHT WITH TROUBLE TO ME IN THAT SAME POSITION YOUR LITTLE ONE IS NOW ALLOW US THEN TO BECOME FRIENDS
AND MIGHT HAVE MET WITH OBJECTIONS ON THE PART OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD FOR THIS REASON IT APPEARS THAT HE FINALLY SELECTED THE PLACE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS FAMILY
WOULD THAT I COULD SEE HER MORNING AND EVENING IN THE PALACE WHERE I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE FAIR LOVED ONE WHOM SHE RESEMBLES HE NOW RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY AND RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS SOON AFTER A DISCIPLE OF THE PRIEST CAME
ARE PERHAPS HAPPY AND CONTENTED NAY SAID THE ATTENDANTS BUT WERE YOU TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN RANGES AND THE SEA COAST IN OUR VARIOUS PROVINCES THE PICTURES WOULD INDEED BE FOUND LOVELY THEN
FOR SHE SILENTLY WATCHED THE EXPRESSION OF THE NUN'S FEATURES AND THEN WITH DOWNCAST EYES BENT HER FACE TOWARDS THE GROUND THE LUSTROUS HAIR FALLING OVER HER BACK IN WAVES THE NUN HUMMED IN A TONE SUFFICIENTLY AUDIBLE TO GENJI
THAT THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO WHOM SUCH THINGS CAN BE PRESENTED BELIEVE ME I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR THIS SAID GENJI LET ME BESEECH YOU TO TAKE IT SO THE ATTENDANT WENT BACK AND PRESENTED IT TO THE NUN
AND FEELS DISAPPOINTED THAT HE HAS NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO GENJI SAID IN REPLY
ONE REASON WHY GENJI WAS SO MUCH ATTRACTED BY HER WAS THAT SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED A CERTAIN LADY IN THE PALACE TO WHOM HE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED THE NUN STROKED THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF THE CHILD AND MURMURED TO HERSELF
THE DEWS THAT WET THE TENDER GRASS AT THE SUN'S BIRTH TOO QUICKLY PASS NOR E'ER CAN HOPE TO SEE IT RISE IN FULL PERFECTION TO THE SKIES SHIONAGON WHO NOW JOINED THEM AND HEARD THE ABOVE DISTICH
HE IS THE DESCENDANT OF A HIGH PERSONAGE AND WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF ELEVATION AT COURT BUT BEING OF AN ECCENTRIC CHARACTER HE WAS STRONGLY AVERSE TO SOCIETY HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CHIUJIO OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD
APPARENTLY BETOKENED THE GOOD TASTE OF ITS INHABITANTS WHOSE HOUSE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED GENJI OF HIS ATTENDANTS THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A HOUSE IN WHICH A CERTAIN PRIEST HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AH I KNOW HIM SAID GENJI
TIS BUT ONE NIGHT ALONE FOR YOU BUT THERE'S A MOUNTAIN MOSS GROWS NIGH WHOSE LEAVES FROM DEW ARE NEVER DRY WHEN GENJI HEARD THIS HE SAID
WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE LAST TIME I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY AND I FOUND THAT THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED IN THE CAPITAL YET THAT HERE HAVING BEEN FORMERLY GOVERNOR
WHICH WAS ALSO A GIRL AND ABOUT THIS GIRL THE GRANDMOTHER IS ALWAYS FEELING VERY ANXIOUS THEN SAID GENJI LET IT NOT APPEAR STRANGE TO YOU IF I SAY THIS BUT I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO BECOME THE GUARDIAN OF THIS GIRL
SHE THEN LEFT THE ROOM POSSIBLY TO LOOK FOR THE LOST BIRD THE PEOPLE WHO ADDRESSED HER CALLED HER SHIONAGON AND SHE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN THE LITTLE GIRL'S NURSE TO YOU SAID THE NUN TO THE GIRL
AND HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE SECRET OF MY EXORCISMS I WONDER WHY YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR ME SO SAYING HE PLEASINGLY EMBRACED HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF GREAT HOLINESS HE WROTE OUT A TALISMANIC PRESCRIPTION
THE PRIEST SAID THIS WITH A GRAVE AND EVEN A STERN EXPRESSION ON HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH CAUSED GENJI TO DROP THE SUBJECT HE THEN ASKED THE PRINCE TO EXCUSE HIM FOR IT WAS THE HOUR FOR VESPERS AND AS HE QUITTED THE ROOM TO ATTEND THE SERVICE
THE ATTENDANT WHO HAD GIVEN THIS ACCOUNT OF THE EX GOVERNOR AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS THE SON OF THE PRESENT GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HE WAS UNTIL LATELY A KURAND AND THIS YEAR HAD RECEIVED THE TITLE OF JUGOI HIS NAME WAS YOSHIKIYO
GENJI THEREFORE SENT FOR THE HERMIT BUT HE DECLINED TO COME SAYING THAT HE WAS TOO OLD AND DECREPIT TO LEAVE HIS RETREAT WHAT SHALL I DO EXCLAIMED GENJI SHALL I VISIT HIM PRIVATELY EVENTUALLY
SO GENJI MADE UP HIS MIND TO STAY THERE SAYING THEN I SHALL NOT RETURN HOME TILL TO MORROW THE DAYS AT THIS SEASON WERE OF LONG DURATION AND HE FELT IT RATHER TIRESOME TO PASS A WHOLE EVENING IN SEDATE SOCIETY SO
SO LATELY SHE HAS BEEN LIVING HERE IN RETIREMENT AH YES SAID GENJI VENTURING UPON A GUESS AND I HEARD THAT SHE BORE A DAUGHTER TO DAINAGON YES SHE HAD A DAUGHTER BUT SHE DIED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
THE SPARROW MAY BE DEARER THAN I MAY BE WHO AM SO ILL BUT HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU OFTEN THAT THE CAGING OF BIRDS IS A SIN BE A GOOD GIRL COME NEARER
ON THE MOUNTAIN THE CHERRY TREES WERE STILL IN BLOSSOM THEY ADVANCED ON THEIR WAY FURTHER AND FURTHER THE HAZE CLUNG TO THE SURFACE LIKE A SOFT SASH DOES ROUND THE WAIST AND TO GENJI WHO HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN OUT OF THE CAPITAL
SUPPOSING THAT I WERE TO LEAVE HER BEHIND I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER AS SHE THUS MURMURED HER COUNTENANCE BECAME SADDENED BY HER FOREBODINGS THE SIGHT MOVED GENJI'S SYMPATHY AS HE GAZED
WE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH EACH OTHER TWAS TO REVEAL THESE WISHES TO YOU THAT I CAME HERE AND RISKED THE CHANCE OF OFFENDING YOU IN DOING SO BELIEVE ME I AM WELL DISPOSED AT YOUR OFFER SAID THE NUN
THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE FREE FROM THE STING OF THESE RECOLLECTIONS THROUGH HIS LIFE AND THAT THERE WAS A WORLD TO COME TOO OH COULD I BUT LIVE IN A RETREAT LIKE THIS PRIEST AS HE THUS THOUGHT OF A RETREAT
MANY PEOPLE HAD RECOVERED THROUGH HIS EXORCISMS IF ADDED THE FRIEND THE DISEASE IS NEGLECTED IT BECOMES SERIOUS TRY THEREFORE THIS METHOD OF PROCURING RELIEF AT ONCE AND BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
AND SHE THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LAST THINKING IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT SHE GAVE ORALLY THE FOLLOWING REPLY TO THE ATTENDANT TO BE GIVEN TO GENJI YOU SAY YOUR SLEEVE IS WET WITH DEW
SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD OR MORE AND WORE A WHITE SILK DRESS WHICH FITTED HER WELL AND WHICH WAS LINED WITH YELLOW HER HAIR WAS WAVED LIKE A FAN AND HER EYES WERE RED FROM CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
SAID HE WOULD RETURN AS SOON AS IT WAS FINISHED GENJI WAS ALONE A SLIGHT SHOWER FELL OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND THE MOUNTAIN BREEZES BLEW COOL THE WATERS OF THE TORRENT WERE SWOLLEN AND THE ROAR OF THEM
AFTER THANKING THE NUN FOR HIS KIND RECEPTION THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY AND DAWN APPEARED THE SKY WAS AGAIN HAZY AND HERE
BUT THE PRINCE'S WIFE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND SEVERE SO SHE HAD MUCH TO SUFFER AND PUT UP WITH I SAW PERSONALLY THE TRUTH THAT CARE KILLS MORE THAN LABOR
HAVE YOU QUARRELLED WITH THE BOY EXCLAIMED THE NUN LOOKING AT HER THERE WAS SOME RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE FEATURES OF THE CHILD AND THE NUN SO GENJI THOUGHT THAT SHE POSSIBLY MIGHT BE HER DAUGHTER INUKI HAS LOST MY SPARROW
WHAT A LOVELY GIRL HE HAD SEEN I CAN GUESS FROM THIS THOUGHT HE WHY THOSE GAY FELLOWS REFERRING TO HIS ATTENDANTS SO OFTEN MAKE THEIR EXPEDITIONS IN SEARCH OF GOOD FORTUNE WHAT A CHARMING LITTLE GIRL HAVE I SEEN TO DAY WHO CAN SHE BE
SO GENJI WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED IN THOUGHT COULD NOT SLUMBER HERE THE PRIEST SAID HE WAS GOING TO VESPERS BUT IN REALITY IT WAS LATER THAN THE PROPER TIME FOR THEM GENJI PERCEIVED
HE STRUCK HIS FAN ON HIS HAND TO SUMMON SOME ONE WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER SAID AN ATTENDANT AND AS SHE CAME NEAR TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM SHE ADDED PERHAPS MY EAR WAS DECEIVED AND SHE BEGAN TO RETIRE BUDDHA WILL GUIDE YOU
BUT WE MUST TAKE IT WITH SOME RESERVE SHE MUST BE AFTER ALL A COUNTRY MAIDEN AND ALL THAT I CAN GIVE CREDIT TO IS THIS MUCH THAT HER MOTHER MAY BE A WOMAN OF SOME SENSE WHO TAKES GREAT CARE OF THE GIRL I AM ONLY AFRAID THAT IF ANY FUTURE GOVERNOR
HOW SPLENDID IT LOOKS WOULD THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO KEEP IT THUS HER EXTREME YOUTH MAKES ME ANXIOUS HOWEVER HER MOTHER DEPARTED THIS LIFE WHEN SHE ONLY A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE WAS QUITE SENSIBLE AT THE AGE OF THIS ONE
I CANNOT INDEED POINT OUT IN DETAIL ITS MOST REMARKABLE FEATURES
SUCCESSIVE GOVERNORS OFTEN OFFER THEIR ADDRESSES TO HER WITH GREAT SINCERITY BUT NO ONE HAS EVER YET BEEN ACCEPTED THE DOMINANT IDEA OF HER FATHER SEEMS TO BE THIS WHAT HAVE I SUNK TO SUCH A POSITION WELL I TRUST AT LEAST
GENJI NOW ENGAGED IN PRAYER UNTIL THE SUN SANK IN THE HEAVENS HIS ATTENDANTS WHO WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS DISEASE TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM TO HAVE A CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME HEREUPON HE ADVANCED TO THE BACK OF THE TEMPLE
DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS VERY DAY PRINCE GENJI VISITED THE HERMIT IN ORDER TO BE EXORCISED BY HIM I MUST FORTHWITH GO AND SEE HIM GENJI OBSERVING THIS MOVEMENT QUICKLY RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY THINKING AS HE WENT
HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY AND RESPECT HIS RESIDENCE MOREOVER IS WELL APPOINTED AND OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE AND HE PERFORMS WITH PUNCTUALITY AND DEVOUTNESS HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES NAY ALMOST WITH MORE EARNESTNESS
SAYING MY MASTER HAS JUST HEARD OF THE PRINCE'S VISIT TO THE MOUNTAIN AND WOULD HAVE WAITED ON HIM AT ONCE BUT THOUGHT IT BETTER TO POSTPONE CALLING NEVERTHELESS
HE WENT OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND PROCEEDED TO THE PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ALL THE ATTENDANTS HAD BEEN DESPATCHED HOME EXCEPT KOREMITZ WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM THEY PEEPED AT THIS BUILDING THROUGH THE HEDGES
TAKING FOUR OR FIVE ATTENDANTS HE STARTED OFF EARLY ONE MORNING FOR THE PLACE WHICH WAS AT NO GREAT DISTANCE ON THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF MARCH AND THOUGH THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON FOR FLOWERS IN THE CAPITAL WAS OVER YET
FOR THAT REASON I WISH TO KEEP MY VISIT AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS I WILL COME NOW TO YOUR MASTER THEREUPON THE PRIEST HIMSELF SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND AFTER BRIEFLY RELATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
REMARKED GENJI WHILE HE HIMSELF SECRETLY DESIRED TO BEHOLD HER AY THOUGHT HIS COMPANIONS WITH HIS SUSCEPTIBLE TEMPERAMENT WHAT WONDER IF THIS STORY TOUCHES HIM
THEY WERE VERY QUIET YET THE SOUND OF THE TELLING OF BEADS WHICH ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK THE LECTERN WAS HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME THE ROOM WAS NOT FAR FROM HIS OWN HE PULLED THE SCREEN SLIGHTLY ASIDE AND STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
THE SCENERY WAS INDESCRIBABLY NOVEL THE ASCETIC LIVED IN A DEEP CAVE IN THE ROCKS NEAR THE LOFTY SUMMIT GENJI DID NOT HOWEVER DECLARE WHO HE WAS AND THE STYLE OF HIS RETINUE WAS OF A VERY PRIVATE CHARACTER
BUT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN INCORRECTLY INFORMED IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL DEPENDENT UPON MYSELF BUT SHE IS BUT A CHILD HER SOCIETY COULD NOT AFFORD YOU ANY PLEASURE AND FORGIVE ME THEREFORE
I HAD ONCE A DREAM WHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHO WAS LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AND HERE TO DAY THAT DREAM HAS AGAIN COME BACK TO MY MEMORY THE PRIEST LAUGHED AND SAID A STRANGE DREAM EVEN WERE YOU TO OBTAIN YOUR WISH
AND NUMEROUS MONASTERIES WERE VISIBLE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN THE DISTANCE BENEATH THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE WINDING PATH IN WHICH THEY WERE WALKING A PICTURESQUE AND PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ITS WELL ARRANGED BALCONIES AND THE GARDENS AROUND IT
THE LITTLE ONE IS HER DAUGHTER AND NO WONDER THAT SHE RESEMBLES THE ONE IN THE PALACE
THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE PRINCE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN THE HERMIT HOWEVER TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SPEND THE EVENING IN THE TEMPLE AND TO BE FURTHER PRAYED FOR HIS ATTENDANTS ALSO SUPPORTED THIS SUGGESTION
BUT HAVING RESIGNED THAT OFFICE HAD BECOME GOVERNOR OF HARIMA HE WAS NOT HOWEVER POPULAR IN THAT OFFICE IN THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS HE REFLECTED WITHIN HIMSELF NO DOUBT THAT HIS PRESENCE IN THE CAPITAL COULD NOT BUT BE DISAGREEABLE
THUS AS THEY DEPICTED THEM TO HIM THEY CHEERED AND GLADDENED HIS MIND ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO SAY AMONG SUCH SIGHTS AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE IS THE SEA COAST OF AKASHI IN THE PROVINCE OF HARIMA WHICH IS I THINK ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
WHICH I KEPT SO CAREFULLY IN THE CAGE REPLIED THE CHILD THAT STUPID BOY SAID ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS HAS HE AGAIN BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS WHERE CAN THE BIRD BE GONE AND ALL THIS TOO AFTER WE HAD TAMED IT WITH SO MUCH CARE
WHEN THEREFORE HIS TERM OF OFFICE EXPIRED HE DETERMINED STILL TO REMAIN IN THE PROVINCE HE DID NOT HOWEVER GO TO THE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS OF THE INTERIOR BUT CHOSE THE SEA COAST THERE ARE IN THIS DISTRICT
HERE TOO THE HOME OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE CONSTITUTES AN OBJECT OF GREAT ATTRACTION
IF I DECLINE YOUR REQUEST YET LET THERE BE NO RESERVE IN THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR IDEAS INTERRUPTED GENJI BUT BEFORE THEY COULD TALK FURTHER THE RETURN OF THE PRIEST PUT AN END TO THE SUBJECT AND GENJI RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS
GENJI ACCEPTED THE OFFER THINKING AS HE WENT I WONDER WHAT THE PRIEST HAS SAID AT HOME ABOUT MYSELF TO THOSE TO WHOM I HAVE NOT YET BEEN INTRODUCED BUT IT WILL BE PLEASANT TO SEE THEM ONCE MORE THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS
CRIED THE ATTENDANTS IN TONES OF SURPRISE SURELY THE REVEREND FATHER WOULD NOT INDULGE IN FLIRTATIONS WHO CAN THEY BE AND SOME OF THEM EVEN DESCENDED A LITTLE DISTANCE AND PEERED OVER THE ENCLOSURE WHERE A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL WAS ALSO SEEN AMONGST THEM
CONSOLED THE NUN WITH THE FOLLOWING THE DEWS WILL NOT SO QUICKLY PASS NOR SHALL DEPART BEFORE THEY SEE THE FULL PERFECTION OF THE GRASS THEY LOVED SO WELL IN INFANCY AT THIS JUNCTURE A PRIEST ENTERED AND SAID
AND THEREFORE BY THE ADVICE OF MY FRIENDS I CAME TO THIS MOUNTAIN TO BE EXORCISED IF HOWEVER THE SPELLS OF THE HOLY MAN ARE OF NO AVAIL TO ME HIS REPUTATION MIGHT SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
THIS AT LENGTH OBLIGED THE NUN TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE CALLED BUDDHA TO WITNESS THAT THOUGH HIS CONDUCT MAY HAVE SEEMED BOLD IT WAS DICTATED BY PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MOTIVES
I DO NOT SEE THE REAL INTENT OF THE EFFUSION THOUGHT THE NUN PERHAPS HE THINKS THAT SHE IS ALREADY A WOMAN BUT SHE CONTINUED WONDERINGLY HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE YOUNG GRASS
WILL YOU SPEAK TO HER GRANDMOTHER ABOUT IT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS ONE TO WHOM MY LOT IS LINKED BUT I CARE BUT LITTLE FOR HER AND INDEED USUALLY LEAD A SOLITARY LIFE YOUR OFFER IS VERY KIND REPLIED THE PRIEST
STRANGE INDEED WOULD IT BE IF HE WERE TO DISCOVER THAT I AM HERE IN THIS PRIVACY THEY NOTICED A NUN AND A FEW MORE FEMALES WITH HER WALKING IN THE GARDEN WHO WERE CARRYING FRESH WATER FOR THEIR OFFERINGS AND WERE GATHERING FLOWERS
IN THE WESTERN ANTECHAMBER OF THE HOUSE WAS PLACED AN IMAGE OF BUDDHA AND HERE AN EVENING SERVICE WAS PERFORMED A NUN RAISING A CURTAIN BEFORE BUDDHA OFFERED A GARLAND OF FLOWERS ON THE ALTAR AND PLACING A KIO OR SUTRA
YET HIS NOBILITY OF MANNERS WAS EASILY RECOGNIZABLE WELCOME YOUR VISIT CRIED THE HERMIT SALUTING HIM PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SENT FOR ME THE OTHER DAY I HAVE LONG SINCE QUITTED THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD
ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY ARE KNOWN TO ME CONTINUED HE LOOK UPON ME I PRAY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR ONCE LOVED DAUGHTER I TOO WHEN A MERE INFANT
AND WAS CUT SHORT BEHIND WHICH SUITED HER VERY WELL SHE WAS HOWEVER PALE AND WEAK HER VOICE ALSO BEING TREMULOUS TWO MAIDEN ATTENDANTS WENT IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM WAITING UPON HER
AND HIS GAZE FELL ON THE FAR OFF CAPITAL IN THE DISTANCE WHICH WAS ENVELOPED IN HAZE AS THE DUSK WAS SETTING IN OVER THE TOPS OF THE TREES AROUND WHAT A LOVELY LANDSCAPE EXCLAIMED GENJI THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SUCH SCENERY IS FAMILIAR
THAN MANY REGULAR PRIESTS HERE GENJI INTERRUPTED WHAT IS HIS DAUGHTER LIKE WITHOUT DOUBT ANSWERED HIS COMPANION THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON IS UNRIVALLED AND SHE IS ENDOWED WITH CORRESPONDING MENTAL ABILITY
WHICH HAD OCCASIONED HIS RETIREMENT TO THIS LOCALITY HE OFFERED TO ESCORT GENJI TO HIS HOUSE SAYING MY DWELLING IS BUT A RUSTIC COTTAGE BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE AT LEAST THE PRETTY MOUNTAIN STREAMLET WHICH WATERS MY GARDEN
SINCE FIRST THAT TENDER GRASS I VIEWED MY HEART NO SOFT REPOSE E'ER FEELS BUT GATHERING MIST MY SLEEVE BEDEWS AND PITY TO MY BOSOM STEALS SURELY YOU SHOULD KNOW SIR
THAT MY ONLY DAUGHTER MAY BE SUCCESSFUL AND PROSPEROUS IN HER LIFE HE OFTEN TOLD HER I HEARD THAT IF SHE SURVIVED HIM AND IF HIS FOND HOPES FOR HER SHOULD NOT BE REALIZED IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO CAST HERSELF INTO THE SEA
HE WAS INVOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY A FANCY THAT HOW HAPPY WOULD HE BE IF ACCOMPANIED TO SUCH A RETREAT BY SUCH A GIRL AS HE HAD SEEN IN THE EVENING AND WITH THIS FANCY HER LOVELY FACE ROSE UP BEFORE HIM SUDDENLY HE SAID TO THE PRIEST
SEVERAL PLACES WHICH ARE WELL SITUATED FOR QUIET RETIREMENT AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED INCONSISTENT IN HIM HAD HE PREFERRED A PART OF THE SEA COAST SO NEAR THE GAY WORLD NEVERTHELESS A RETREAT IN THE TOO REMOTE INTERIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SOLITARY
MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES AND ALSO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF MAN'S FUTURE DESTINY GENJI AS HE HEARD HIM FELT SOME QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE FOR HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS OWN CONDUCT WAS FAR FROM BEING IRREPROACHABLE THE THOUGHT TROUBLED HIM
THROUGH THE MOUTH OF A THIRD PERSON ALTHOUGH I THANK THE LADY FOR EVEN THAT MUCH I SHOULD FEEL MORE OBLIGED TO HER IF SHE WOULD GRANT ME AN INTERVIEW AND ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO HER MY SINCERE WISHES
THE FOUNTAIN WAS LIT UP BY TORCHES AND MANY LAMPS ALSO WERE LIGHTED IN THE GARDEN GENJI WAS TAKEN TO AN AIRY ROOM IN THE SOUTHERN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WHERE INCENSE WHICH WAS BURNING THREW ITS SWEET ODORS AROUND THE PRIEST RELATED TO HIM
I'VE GOT A TIE PIN I SAID STATION MASTERS HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR TIE PINS AND A WATCH AND A CIGARETTE CASE I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LEND YOU ANY OF THOSE THE IDEA DIDN'T APPEAL TO HIM
AT THE JUNCTION I JUMPED OUT QUICKLY AND DIVED INTO THE SACRED OFFICE I'VE LEFT MY TICKET ON THE DRESSING THAT IS TO SAY I FORGOT WELL ANYHOW I HAVEN'T GOT IT I BEGAN AND WE PLUNGED INTO EXPLANATIONS ONCE MORE
WHAT IS HOME WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THE STATION MASTER AT LONDON I SUPPOSE I'VE A GOOD MIND TO SAY SNAP EXTREMELY ANNOYED I STRODE OUT AND BUMPED INTO YOU'LL NEVER GUESS HERBERT
I RODE AFTER YOU THE TRAIN WAS JUST GOING JUMPED INTO IT BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE STATION FOR YOU IT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU HERBERT DIDN'T I SAY GOOD BYE YOUR TICKET HE PRODUCED IT LEFT IT ON THE DRESSING TABLE HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD
AT THAT MOMENT A PORTER CAME UP DID YOU GIVE UP YOUR TICKET SIR HE ASKED HERBERT I HADN'T TIME TO GET ONE SAID HERBERT QUITE AT HIS EASE I'LL PAY NOW AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIS POCKETS THE TRAIN MOVED OUT OF THE STATION
AND MY EMERALD AND DIAMOND TIE PIN THAT WAS THE SORT OF MAN I WAS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HE SAID WALKING WITH ME TO THE DOOR IS TO TAKE A TICKET TO PLYMOUTH AND SPEAK TO THE STATION MASTER THERE THIS IS A MOST INTERESTING GAME I SAID BITTERLY
THIS STATION MASTER WAS EVEN MORE UNEMOTIONAL THAN THE LAST HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO COULD VOUCH FOR ME I MENTIONED HERBERT DIFFIDENTLY HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HERBERT I SHOWED HIM MY GOLD WATCH MY SILVER CIGARETTE CASE
BLESS YOU I SAID AS I GOT HAPPILY INTO MY TRAIN YOU'VE SAVED MY LIFE I'VE HAD AN AWFUL TIME I SAY DO YOU KNOW I'VE MET TWO STATION MASTERS ALREADY THIS MORNING WHO'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF YOU YOU MUST ENQUIRE INTO IT
WELL THE MONEY WOULD LAST LONGER THAT WAY BUT UNLESS I COULD OVERCOME QUICKLY THE DISTRUST WHICH I SEEMED TO INSPIRE IN STATION MASTERS THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH LEFT FOR LUNCH I GAVE THE PORTER ALL I COULD AFFORD A HA'PENNY MENTIONED APOLOGETICALLY THAT I WAS COMING BACK AND STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN
A LOOK OF HORROR CAME OVER HERBERT'S FACE I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT HE HADN'T ANY MONEY ON HIM HI HE SHOUTED TO ME AND THEN WE SWUNG ROUND A BEND OUT OF SIGHT WELL WELL HE'LL HAVE TO GET HOME SOMEHOW
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HE SAID IS TO TAKE A TICKET TO THE NEXT STATION AND TALK TO THEM THERE THIS IS ONLY A BRANCH LINE AND I HAVE NO POWER TO GIVE YOU A PASS SO THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO DO
YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOURSELF OH QUITE SO
BUT I CAN FANCY ALSO THAT I COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT SOMETHING OF DISGUST MISS ALTIFIORLA WHEN SHE WROTE THIS HAD UNDERSTOOD WELL THAT VANITY AND LOVE OF FLATTERY WERE CONSPICUOUS TRAITS IN THE CHARACTER OF HER ADMIRER HAVING OWNED SO MUCH
I SAY LIES HAVE BEEN TOLD BUT I DO NOT SAY WHO HAS TOLD THEM I RATHER SUSPECT A WOMAN TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SIR FRANCIS WHO HAD IN HIS POCKET A MOST TENDER AND LOVING REPLY FROM MISS ALTIFIORLA
THAT SHE HAD BETTER WRITE WOMAN INSTEAD AND SHE HAD WRITTEN IT WHAT MORE IS THERE FOR ME TO ADD TO THE ABOVE EXCEPT TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART MONTHS AGO IT SEEMS TO BE YEARS NOW WHEN CECILIA HOLT HAD CAUGHT YOUR FANCY
AND HER ASSURANCE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER INTERFERE WITH HIM
BUT WITH YOU I SHALL ONLY ATTEMPT TO HOLD MY OWN BY MAKING MYSELF ONE WITH YOU IN ALL YOUR DESIRES AND ASPIRATIONS I AM YOURS WITH ALL MY HEART WITH ALL MY BODY AND SOUL FRANCESCA
AND THEY WERE MORE THAN DICK COULD ENDURE THE NATURAL INDIGNATION OF THE MAN WAS AROUSED SO THAT BY DEGREES IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HE HATED THE BARONET HE HAD BEFORE SAID VERY SHARP WORDS TO HIM BUT HAD NOW GONE HOME RESOLVED IN HIS RIGHTEOUS MIND TO BRING THINGS TO A CONCLUSION
WHAT MY ANSWER WOULD BE WHEN A WOMAN ATTEMPTS TO DECEIVE A MAN IN SUCH A MATTER SHE KNOWS BEFOREHAND THAT THE ATTEMPT WILL BE VAIN AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT I COULD SUCCEED WITH YOU BUT YET A FEELING OF SHAMEFACEDNESS WHAT SOME LADIES CONSIDER AS MODESTY
WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THERE IS AN ASPERITY RATHER THAN STRICTNESS ABOUT HER WHICH I KNEW YOUR SPIRIT WOULD NOT BROOK SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE THE BATTLINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE ARISEN WITH AN EQUAL TEMPER SHE CAN INDEED BEAR ALL THINGS WITH EQUANIMITY AS SHE DOES HER PRESENT POSITION BUT YOU
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THE BISHOP AND TAKEN A LESSON IN PREACHING I NEVER HEARD YOU COME OUT SO STRONG BEFORE I WISH YOU'D HEARD WHAT SOME OF THOSE MEN AT PERTH SAID ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU ANSWERED THEM AS MY FRIEND AS FAR AS I REMEMBER I DIDN'T SAY MUCH MYSELF
HE KNEW FROM FORMER EXPERIENCE WHAT DICK WOULD AND WHAT HE WOULD NOT BEAR I DON'T CHOOSE TO DESCEND TO BILLINGSGATE SAID SIR FRANCIS
BUT THEY WERE DAMNABLE LIES YOU SOMETIMES TELL ME THAT I AIN'T ANY BETTER THAN ANOTHER OR GENERALLY A GREAT DEAL WORSE BUT I'D RATHER HAVE BLOWN MY BRAINS OUT THAN HAVE TOLD SUCH LIES ABOUT A WOMAN AS HAVE BEEN TOLD HERE BY SOMEBODY YOU ASK ME WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AT THE CLUB IN PERTH
BUT I HOPE IT WILL PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS TO VISIT YOUR MOST WORTHY CLERICAL RELATIONS IN THIS CATHEDRAL CITY BEFORE LONG I SHALL SAY NOTHING TO ANY OF YOUR CLERICAL RELATIONS AS TO MY PROSPECTS IN LIFE UNTIL I SHALL HAVE RECEIVED YOUR SANCTION FOR DOING SO BUT THE SOONER I DO RECEIVE IT
HAD A MAN OR A WOMAN IT'S ALL ONE GONE TO THAT POOR CREATURE WITH A PISTOL IN HIS HAND AND BLOWN HER BRAINS OUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE A MORE DASTARDLY ACTION WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE OTHER I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU SPECIALLY
HE LOVED TO BE FLATTERED AND WAS PRONE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING GOOD OF HIMSELF THAT WAS SAID TO HIM BY ONE OF THEM HE THEREFORE TOOK THE FOLLOWING LETTER FOR MORE THAN IT WAS WORTH MY DEAR SIR FRANCIS I KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE BEEN QUITE QUICK ENOUGH TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU RECEIVED MY FORMER LITTLE SCRAWL
I SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT SAID DICK LIES ARE A SORT OF THING WHICH ARE VERY COMMONLY TOLD AND ARE ORDINARILY ASCRIBED TO THE WORLD AT LARGE THE WORLD NEVER QUARRELS WITH THE ACCUSATION THE WORLD HAS TOLD MOST INFERNAL LIES TO THIS MAN ABOUT HIS WIFE
WOULD STILL HAVE SUFFERED I DO NOT THINK THAT THE WIFE YOU NOW DESIRE IS ONE WITH WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO WAGE WAR SHALL I SAY THAT IF YOU MARRY HER WHOM YOU HAVE NOW ASKED TO JOIN HER LOT WITH YOURS THERE WILL BE NO SUCH FIGHTING
ALL THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS THAT HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU OWE ME I OWE YOU NOTHING THAT I'VE EVER PROMISED TO PAY
I HAVE SACRIFICED NO GIRL TO MY REVENGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS THROWN ME OVER IN THE LITTLE TRANSACTIONS I HAVE HAD I HAVE ALWAYS RUN STRAIGHT
BUT THEY WERE OF A NATURE TO FILL HIS MIND WITH RIGHTEOUS WRATH AND TO PRODUCE FROM HIM THE ELOQUENCE ABOVE DESCRIBED SIR FRANCIS WHOSE VANITY HAD BEEN CHARMED BY THE LETTER WHICH HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND TO PART WITH DICK
IN NOTHING WAS HE MORE GRATIFIED THAN IN HER ALLUSIONS TO HIS MATRIMONIAL EFFORTS WITH MISS HOLT SHE HAD ASSURED HIM
PEOPLE MAY DECLARE THAT I AM GOOD FOR NOTHING AND MAY HOLD ME UP AS AN EXAMPLE TO BE SHUNNED BUT I FLATTER MYSELF THAT NOBODY HAS CALLED ME A BLACKGUARD I HAVE TOLD NO LIES TO INJURE MEN BEHIND THEIR BACKS MUCH LESS HAVE I DONE SO TO INJURE A WOMAN
SIR FRANCIS WHEN HE WAS LEFT ALONE TOOK OUT MISS ALTIFIORLA'S LETTER AND READ IT AGAIN HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD ASSUME GRAND MANNERS IN HIS PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN
WHEN YOU ASKED ME DID YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR MY DINNERS AND WINE SIR FRANCIS REFUSED TO MAKE ANY REPLY TO THIS QUESTION AND WHEN YOU DELICATELY HINTED AT MY POVERTY HAD YOU FOUND MY FINANCES TO BE LOWER THAN YOU'D ALWAYS KNOWN THEM
PERHAPS TO MORROW WILL DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO ADD A FEW DROPS TO ALL THOSE BUCKETS OF CLARET WHICH YOU THREW IN MY TEETH JUST NOW I WONDER WHETHER ANY GENTLEMAN WAS EVER BEFORE ASKED BY ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
VERY GENTLEMANLIKE ISN'T IT SAID DICK WITH A SMILE MEANING THEREBY TO IMPUTE IT TO SIR FRANCIS AS COWARDICE THAT HE WAS UNWILLING TO SAY THE REVERSE BUT UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I SUPPOSE I COULD OR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE DRANK OF MY WINE I HAVEN'T MADE A CALCULATION OF THAT NATURE IT ISN'T USUAL FOR SHOOTING HERE HOW MUCH HAVE YOU EVER CONTRIBUTED WHEN I SHOOT I CONTRIBUTE NOTHING
AND NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE BUCKET OF CLARET JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID SIR FRANCIS THEN DICK ROSS LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT AWAY TO MAKE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS DEPARTURE AS WERE POSSIBLE TO HIM AND THE READERS OF THIS STORY SHALL SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM NO MORE
BUT SHE HAD AT THE SAME TIME TOLD HIM OF THE EXTREME TENDERNESS OF HIS HEART HE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED HER WHEN SHE WHISPERED TO HIM HER SECRET THAT SHE HAD ENVIED CECILIA HER LOT WHEN CECILIA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HAPPY BRIDE
THEN THERE ARE THE MANNERS AND THE PECULIAR STATION BEFORE THE WORLD WHICH IS QUITE SEPARATE FROM THE RANK TO ME THESE ALONE ARE IRRESISTIBLE SHALL I SAY TOO THAT PERSONAL APPEARANCE DOES COUNT FOR MUCH I CAN FANCY MYSELF MARRYING AN UGLY MAN
FORCED ME INTO TEMPORARY SILENCE WHAT COULD I WISH BETTER THAN TO BE LOVED BY SUCH A ONE AS YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS THE RANK WHICH GOES FOR MUCH WITH ME THEN THERE IS THE MONEY WHICH I ADMIT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING
IT MUST BE HERE EXPLAINED THAT DICK ROSS WAS NOT A MAN WHO FEARED MANY THINGS BUT THAT SIR FRANCIS FEARED MUCH DICK HAD LITTLE TO LOSE BY A ROW WHEREAS THE BARONET WOULD BE INJURED THE BARONET THEREFORE DECLINED TO FILL IN THE EPITHET WHICH HE HAD OMITTED
BUT DICK'S WORDS AS NOW SPOKEN LEFT HIM NO ALTERNATIVE IT WAS A QUESTION WITH HIM WHETHER HE COULD NOT SO PART WITH HIM AS TO INFLICT SOME FURTHER PUNISHMENT WHY DICK HE SAID SMILING YOU HAVE BROKEN OUT QUITE IN A NEW PLACE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT
WHAT IS THERE MORE TO SAY THAN THAT I AM THE HAPPIEST WOMAN BETWEEN THE SEAS THE READER MUST BE HERE TOLD THAT THIS LETTER HAD BEEN COPIED OUT A SECOND TIME BECAUSE IN THE FIRST COPY SHE HAD ALLOWED THE WORD GIRL TO PASS IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE SOMETHING TOLD HER
IT WAS THUS THAT HE SPOKE TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE LETTER AS HE SUCKED IN THE FLATTERY IT WAS THUS THAT MISS ALTIFIORLA HAD INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE IT SHE KNEW HERSELF TOO WELL TO SUSPECT THAT HER FLATTERY SHOULD FAIL NOT A WORD OF IT FAILED
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE WORLD MEANS TO CALL ME OUT FOR SAYING AS MUCH AS THAT THEN THE TWO REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS AND DICK PROCEEDED WITH HIS ELOQUENCE
THE BETTER FOR MY PEACE OF MIND SIR FRANCIS WAS UPON THE WHOLE DELIGHTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE MORE DELIGHTED AS HE NOW READ IT FOR THE THIRD TIME
I DID REGARD HER AS THE MOST FORTUNATE GIRL BUT I DID NOT REGARD YOU AS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
NOW YOU KNOW IT PRETTY WELL ALL IT MUST BE SUPPOSED THAT WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE CLUB HAD INDUCED DICK TO DETERMINE THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER BECOME HIM TO REMAIN WITH SIR FRANCIS AS HIS HUMBLE FRIEND VERY EVIL THINGS HAD IN TRUTH BEEN SAID OF SIR FRANCIS
WHAT I DID SAY CERTAINLY WAS NOT IN YOUR FAVOUR BUT I WAS HARDEST ON THAT SWEET YOUNG LADY WITH THE ITALIAN NAME YOU WON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE YOU AND SHE ARE TWO NOW CAN YOU TELL ME ROSS
IT IS DISAGREEABLE TO BE A PENNILESS YOUNGER BROTHER I HAVE FOUND IT SO ALL MY LIFE AND I ADMIT THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE EARNED MY BREAD
WELL LIES MEAN LIES AS I HAVEN'T APPLIED THE WORD TO ANYONE I SUPPOSE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO USE IT AND TO STAND BY IT I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT LIES MEAN AND I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AWARE THAT WESTERN HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE LIES ABOUT HIS WIFE WHO TOLD THEM
IN FACT SHE HAS GONE TO UNDO WHAT YOU DID IF SHE CAN ONLY SUCCEED IN MAKING THE MAN KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT IT FREE FROM ALL LIES SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE'S GONE TO DO WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY LIES SAID SIR FRANCIS RISING IN WRATH FROM HIS CHAIR
WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME IN CONFIDENCE I DON'T I THINK IT A VERY A VERY WHAT SIR FRANCIS I HAVE NOT DONE AS YOU ALLEGE BUT YOU WERE GOING TO OBSERVE A VERY WHAT WAS IT
THAT MAN HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT HIS WIFE WHICH ARE ALL LIES LIES FROM BEGINNING TO END HE HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO ME FIRST IS THAT A LIE THAT DEPENDS ON THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS TOLD HE DIDN'T SEND HER HOME MERELY FOR THAT
THEIR WIVES THEIR SOULS DEPENDED ON IT IT WAS VERY FINE HE OFTEN WISHED THAT HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN THEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HARRY WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO COMMENCE A CONVERSATION ABOUT LADY ONGAR
BUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE BURTONS WERE PEOPLE SO FAR REMOVED IN THEIR SPHERE OF LIFE FROM LADY ONGAR THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE IN ONSLOW CRESCENT IT WAS HIS LOT IN LIFE TO BE CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE OF THE TWO CLASSES HE DID NOT AT ALL MEAN TO SAY
THREE OR FOUR MEN HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE COUNT SHOWING THAT HE WAS WELL KNOWN GIVING NOTICE AS IT WERE THAT PATEROFF WOULD BECOME A PUBLIC MAN WHEN ONCE HE WAS PLACED IN A PUBLIC CIRCLE TO HAVE GIVEN A DINNER TO THE COUNT
BUT THE COUNT NEVER FORGOT ANY OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES FOR PLEASURE AND IN ALL THINGS MADE THE MOST OF HIS OWN RESOURCES TO BE RICH IS NOT TO HAVE ONE OR TEN THOUSAND A YEAR BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE OR TEN THOUSAND
BUT HIS GUEST WAS BY NO MEANS A MAN OF THAT STAMP EXCEPTING THAT THE COUNT'S AGE WAS ALTOGETHER UNCERTAIN NO CORRECTNESS OF GUESS ON THAT MATTER BEING POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF HIS APPEARANCE HARRY'S PRECONCEIVED NOTION WAS WRONG IN EVERY POINT
BUT HER NAME HAS BEEN COVERED WITH LIES WHAT CAN I DO
I DO NOT LIVE IN MOUNT STREET I HAVE MY ADDRESS SOMETIMES AT HER HOUSE MADAME GORDELOUP YES MADAME GORDELOUP SHE IS LADY ONGAR'S FRIEND SHE WILL TALK TO YOU WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME COUNT PATEROFF OH NO IT IS NOT NECESSARY
AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I HAD NOT EVEN IF I HAD PATEROFF WAS SPEAKING OF LADY ONGAR IN THIS WAY AND HARRY HATED HIM FOR DOING SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANY GOOD OF HER SAID HE OR ANY EVIL I CERTAINLY SHALL SAY NO EVIL OF HER
HARRY WAS SHARP ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT ANY ASSERTION MADE UNDER SUCH A STIPULATION WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING IT WAS AS WHEN A MAN IN DENYING THE TRUTH OF A STATEMENT DOES SO WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT ON THAT SUBJECT
CHAPTER FOURTEEN COUNT PATEROFF AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME WEEKS DURING WHICH HARRY HAD BEEN DOWN AT CLAVERING AND HAD RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS WORK AT THE ADELPHI COUNT PATEROFF CALLED AGAIN IN BLOOMSBURY SQUARE BUT HARRY WAS AT MISTER BEILBY'S OFFICE
I LIKE THIS CLUB BECAUSE WE WHO ARE STRANGERS HAVE SO CHARMING A ROOM FOR OUR SMOKING IT IS THE BEST CLUB IN LONDON FOR MEN WHO DO NOT BELONG TO IT IT OCCURRED TO HARRY THAT IN THE SMOKING ROOM THERE COULD BE NO PRIVACY
AND SAID SOMETHING AS TO A PRIVATE LITTLE DINNER FOR TWO THEREBY APOLOGIZING FOR PROPOSING TO THE COUNT TO DINE WITHOUT OTHER GUESTS PATEROFF ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND HARRY NEVER HAVING DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE ORDERED HIS DINNER WITH MUCH NERVOUSNESS
LORD ONGAR ABROAD OH YES VERY WELL AND FOR MANY YEARS HERE IN LONDON AND AT VIENNA AND VERY EARLY IN LIFE AT SAINT PETERSBURG I KNEW LORD ONGAR FIRST IN RUSSIA WHEN HE WAS ATTACHED TO THE EMBASSY AS FREDERIC COURTON
BETTER THAN HE KNEW IT HIMSELF SLOWLY THE COUNT ATE HIS DINNER ENJOYING EVERY MORSEL THAT HE TOOK WITH THAT THOUGHTFUL CONSCIOUS PLEASURE WHICH YOUNG MEN NEVER ATTAIN IN EATING AND DRINKING AND WHICH MEN AS THEY GROW OLDER SO OFTEN FORGET TO ACQUIRE
YOU CAN GO TO MOUNT STREET AND SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED THERE IS THE CARD AND NOW WE WILL SMOKE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT WITH GOOD BREEDING DETAIN THE COUNT ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR LED THE WAY INTO THE SMOKING ROOM
HARRY AT ONCE RETURNED THE COUNT'S VISIT AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN IN MOUNT STREET MADAME WAS AT HOME SAID THE SERVANT GIRL FROM WHICH HARRY WAS LED TO SUPPOSE THAT THE COUNT WAS A MARRIED MAN BUT HARRY FELT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO INTRUDE UPON MADAME SO HE SIMPLY LEFT HIS CARD
ALL THAT EVERY POUND AND EVERY SHILLING AND EVERY PENNY WILL GIVE YOU AFTER THIS FASHION THE COUNT WAS A RICH MAN YOU DON'T SIT AFTER DINNER HERE I SUPPOSE SAID THE COUNT WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED AN ELABORATE WASHING OF HIS MOUTH AND MOUSTACHE
EITHER OF LADY ONGAR OR OF HER LATE HUSBAND AT THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN DOWN TO ONGAR PARK ON THAT MISSION WHICH HAD BEEN AS WE KNOW FUTILE BUT HE SAID NO WORD OF THAT TO HARRY HE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS DINNER THOROUGHLY AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE
HE WAS A FAIR MAN WITH A BROAD FAIR FACE AND VERY LIGHT BLUE EYES HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOW BUT BROAD HE WORE NO WHISKERS BUT BORE ON HIS LIP A HEAVY MOUSTACHE WHICH WAS NOT GRAY BUT PERFECTLY WHITE WHITE IT WAS WITH YEARS OF COURSE
ON THE NEXT DAY HE DINED IN ONSLOW CRESCENT WITH THE BURTONS AND WHEN THERE HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT LADY ONGAR OR COUNT PATEROFF HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE HAD ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR BEING SILENT ON THE SUBJECT
YOU WILL TAKE NO MORE WINE NO MORE WINE I TAKE MY WINE AT DINNER AS YOU SAW I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE SPECIAL QUESTION ABOUT LADY ONGAR
SHAKING HANDS WITH HARRY CLAVERING DECLARED THAT HE HAD INCURRED NO TROUBLE AND DECLARED ALSO THAT HE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLE IN OBEYING A BEHEST FROM HIS FRIEND LADY ONGAR HAD HE BEEN A POLE AS WAS THE COUNT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ADD
AND SAID THAT LONDON WAS A MAGNIFICENT CITY OH YES HE KNEW LONDON WELL HAD KNOWN IT THESE TWENTY YEARS HAD BEEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS A MEMBER OF THE TRAVELLERS HE LIKED EVERYTHING ENGLISH EXCEPT HUNTING ENGLISH HUNTING HE HAD FOUND TO BE DULL WORK
BUT HE LIKED SHOOTING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO HE COULD NOT RIVAL HE SAID THE INTENSE ENERGY OF AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WOULD WORK ALL DAY WITH HIS GUN HARDER THAN PLOUGHMEN WITH THEIR PLOUGHS ENGLISHMEN SPORTED HE SAID AS THOUGH MORE THAN THEIR BREAD AS THOUGH THEIR HONOR
WISHING HOWEVER REALLY TO HAVE THIS INTERVIEW AND HAVING BEEN LATELY ELECTED AT A CLUB OF WHICH HE WAS RATHER PROUD HE WROTE TO THE COUNT ASKING HIM TO DINE WITH HIM AT THE BEAUFORT HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A STRANGER'S ROOM WHICH PATEROFF KNEW VERY WELL HAVING OFTEN DINED AT THE BEAUFORT
THE COUNT WAS PUNCTUAL AND THE TWO MEN INTRODUCED THEMSELVES HARRY HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A HANDSOME FOREIGNER WITH BLACK HAIR POLISHED WHISKERS AND PROBABLY A HOOK NOSE FORTY YEARS OF AGE OR THEREABOUTS BUT SO GOT UP AS TO LOOK NOT MUCH MORE THAN THIRTY
I WILL SAY ANYTHING IN HER FAVOR THAT YOU PLEASE I AM ALWAYS READY TO SAY ANYTHING IN THE FAVOR OF ANY LADY AND IF NEEDS BE
HIS FATHER LORD COURTON WAS THEN ALIVE AS WAS ALSO HIS GRANDFATHER HE WAS A NICE GOOD LOOKING LAD THEN AS REGARDS HIS BEING NICE
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE TIME WITH HIM SAID HARRY THE COUNT PUT UP HIS HANDS AGAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD SHE KNEW HE WAS NO LONGER AN ADONIS WHEN HE MARRIED HER AN ADONIS NO
THIS THE COUNT NOTICED BY SIMPLY SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND SMILING AS HE SIPPED HIS WINE BY ALL THAT I CAN HEAR HE BECAME A HORRID BRUTE WHEN HE MARRIED SAID HARRY ENERGETICALLY HE WAS NOT PLEASANT WHEN HE WAS ILL AT FLORENCE SAID THE COUNT
I KNOW NOTHING LOOK HERE MISTER CLAVERING IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY INQUIRY YOU HAD BETTER GO TO MY SISTER I DON'T SEE WHAT GOOD IT WILL DO
SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR A LADY ALL ALONE AND A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE A HOUSE SO BEAUTIFUL THEY TELL ME WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT SAID HARRY WHEREUPON THE COUNT AGAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT
ACCOMPANIED BY SOMETHING OF RESTLESSNESS IN HIS EYE
BECAUSE THE MAN WAS RICH HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN ILL TREATING HIS WIFE DID HE NOT BRING FALSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ROB HER AFTER HIS DEATH OF ALL THAT OF WHICH YOU THINK SO MUCH DID HE NOT HEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HER TO HIS OWN DISHONOR
THAT WAS ONGAR'S FAULT ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS NO ONE KNEW IT BETTER THAN HUGH CLAVERING BUT SAID HARRY AND THEN HE STOPPED HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WISHED TO LEARN FROM THE MAN THOUGH HE CERTAINLY DID WISH TO LEARN SOMETHING
BUT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW AT FIRST TO INTRODUCE HER NAME COUNT PATEROFF HAD COME TO HIM AT LADY ONGAR'S REQUEST AND THEREFORE AS HE THOUGHT THE COUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO MENTION HER BUT THE COUNT SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING HIS DINNER WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT
EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED THE ONGAR CLASS BETTER BUT STILL AS SUCH WAS HIS LOT HE MUST TAKE IT AS IT CAME AND ENTERTAIN BOTH SUBJECTS OF INTEREST WITHOUT ANY COMMINGLING OF THEM
WHEN THE WINE WAS DISCUSSED HE TOLD HARRY THAT A CERTAIN VINTAGE OF MOSELLE WAS VERY FAMOUS AT THE BEAUFORT HARRY ORDERED THE WINE OF COURSE AND WAS DELIGHTED TO GIVE HIS GUEST THE BEST OF EVERYTHING BUT HE WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED AT FINDING THAT THE STRANGER KNEW HIS CLUB
BUT YET IT GAVE NO SIGN OF AGE TO HIS FACE HE WAS WELL MADE ACTIVE AND SOMEWHAT BROAD IN THE SHOULDERS THOUGH RATHER BELOW THE MIDDLE HEIGHT
AND HIS DINNER AT THE BEAUFORT NOR DID HE MENTION THE DINNER TO HIS DEAR FRIEND CECILIA
EXPRESSING AN OPINION THAT THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS UNEXCEPTIONAL THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS ORDERED AND HARRY AS HE FILLED HIS GLASS CONSIDERED THE WAY IN WHICH HIS SUBJECT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED YOU KNEW LORD ONGAR I THINK ABROAD
OF LADY ONGAR AND HIS EARLY LOVE HE HAD SPOKEN TO FLORENCE AT SOME LENGTH BUT HE DID NOT FIND IT NECESSARY IN HIS LETTERS
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS BEEN MOST CRUELLY TREATED WELL THERE IS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR I THINK SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR NOT FRANCS BUT POUNDS WE POOR FOREIGNERS LOSE OURSELVES IN AMAZEMENT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT YOUR ENGLISH FORTUNES
BUT BEING SIMPLY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN HE WAS MUCH TOO AWKWARD FOR ANY SUCH COURTESY AS THAT THE COUNT OBSERVED THE OMISSION SMILED AND BOWED
WHEN THERE THE MAN OF THE WORLD SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND OF WHOSE ENTHUSIASM HE HAD PERHAPS HAD ENOUGH AND WAS SOON ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SUNDRY OTHER MEN OF HIS OWN STANDING HARRY SOON PERCEIVED THAT HIS GUEST HAD NO FURTHER NEED OF HIS COUNTENANCE
AND HIS SPEECH HARDLY BETRAYED THAT HE WAS NOT ENGLISH HARRY KNOWING THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER NOTICED NOW AND AGAIN SOME LITTLE ACQUIRED DISTINCTNESS OF SPEECH WHICH IS HARDLY NATURAL TO A NATIVE BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS TONGUE TO BETRAY HIM
HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING ANY NUMBER OF LIES I DID NOT WRITE THE BOOK
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE COUNT WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TALKED ABOUT LADY ONGAR AND THOSE FLORENTINE DAYS BUT THIS HE DID NOT SEEM DISPOSED TO DO SHALL WE HAVE OUR CIGARS NOW SAID COUNT PATEROFF ONE MOMENT IF YOU DON'T MIND CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THERE IS NO HURRY
WOULD BE BY NO MEANS SATISFACTORY TO HARRY'S FEELINGS THOUGH AS IT APPEARED IT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY SATISFACTORY TO THE GUEST HARRY THEREFORE SUGGESTED ONE BOTTLE OF CLARET THE COUNT AGREED
LET US SMOKE YOUR SISTER YES MY SISTER MADAME GORDELOUP IS HER NAME HAS NOT LADY ONGAR MENTIONED MY SISTER THEY ARE INSEPARABLES MY SISTER LIVES IN MOUNT STREET WITH YOU NO NOT WITH ME
SHE DID NOT EXPECT AN ADONIS BUT SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING OF THE HONOR AND FEELINGS OF A MAN SHE FOUND IT UNCOMFORTABLE NO DOUBT HE DID TOO MUCH OF THIS YOU KNOW SAID THE COUNT RAISING HIS GLASS TO HIS LIPS AND HE DIDN'T DO IT WITH FIFTY ONE LAFITTE
FOR A RUMBLE OF WHEELS NOW ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THAT LUGUBRIOUS VEHICLE THE BLACK MARIA WHEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS REMOVED FROM HER CELL
LECOQ WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE STATION HOUSE WHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT BROUGHT HIM TO A STANDSTILL
THAT SHE WAS AT LENGTH GOT INTO THE VAN THEN IT WAS THAT THE OFFICIALS TURNED TO THE ASSASSIN
AT ALL EVENTS WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE THE PRISONER ATE WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE
BUT A SECOND LATER HE CHANGED HIS MIND ALL THE SAME HE SAID I SHOULDN'T MIND A CRUST AND A DRINK OF WINE
BY WHICH THE MEN ON GUARD WATCH THE PRISONERS LECOQ EAGERLY EXAMINED THE APPEARANCE OF THE ASSUMED MURDERER HE WAS OBLIGED TO ASK HIMSELF IF THIS WAS REALLY THE SAME MAN HE HAD SEEN SOME HOURS PREVIOUSLY AT THE POIVRIERE
IN HIS OPINION IF THE MURDERER HAD ASKED FOR A DRINK AFTER AT FIRST REFUSING TO PARTAKE OF ANYTHING
HE TALKED OF HIS FAMILY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN HENCE HE HAS NEITHER CHILDREN WIFE NOR FAMILY
HE EXCLAIMED THE KEEPER LAUGHED HEARTILY HOW COULD HE HAVE HAD ANY HE RESPONDED ISN'T THE OLD WOMAN ALONE IN HER CELL AH THE OLD WRETCH SHE HAS BEEN CURSING AND THREATENING EVER SINCE SHE ARRIVED
HOPING NAY ALMOST EXPECTING THAT THE MURDERER WOULD NOT DRINK IT WITHOUT SOME SIGN OF REPUGNANCE AND YET THE CONTRARY PROVED THE CASE HOWEVER THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD NO TIME TO PONDER OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE
ASKED LECOQ I AM INNOCENT RESPONDED THE PRISONER IN A HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICE I HOPE SO I AM SURE BUT THAT IS FOR THE MAGISTRATE TO DECIDE I CAME TO SEE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING NO REPLIED THE MURDERER
LECOQ'S GLANCE AND GESTURE WERE SO EXPRESSIVE OF IMPATIENCE AND WRATH THAT THE KEEPER PAUSED IN HIS RECITAL MUCH PERTURBED WHAT IS THE MATTER HE STAMMERED WHY ARE YOU ANGRY BECAUSE REPLIED LECOQ FURIOUSLY
HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE MURDERER HE PLAYED HIS PART PERFECTLY STILL I KNOW THAT HE DID PLAY A PART AND THAT IS SOMETHING
STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE INNER DOOR AND HOLDING THE WHOLE SQUAD OF POLICE AGENTS IN CHECK BY THE INTENSE FURY OF HIS ATTITUDE NOW ON THE CONTRARY HE SEEMED AS IT WERE THE PERSONIFICATION OF WEAKNESS AND DESPONDENCY
YOU TELL THEM ALL THEY DESIRE TO KNOW AND AFTERWARD IF YOU VENTURE TO ASK THEM ANYTHING THEY REPLY NOTHING OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IT MAKES THEM PROUD LOOKING THROUGH THE LITTLE LATTICED WINDOW IN THE DOOR
NO MURMURED LECOQ NO THIS MAN IS NOT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SO SAYING HE ENTERED THE CELL THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS HEAD GAVE THE DETECTIVE AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE BUT DID NOT UTTER A WORD WELL HOW GOES IT
HOW OLD WOULD YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY DID YOU FORM ANY IDEA OF HIS PROFESSION IT'S MY OPINION THAT WHAT WITH HIS SOFT CAP AND HIS HEAVY BROWN OVERCOAT HE MUST BE EITHER A CLERK
HE WAS SEATED ON A BENCH OPPOSITE THE GRATING IN THE DOOR HIS ELBOWS RESTING ON HIS KNEES HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND
DRAINED IT SLOWLY AND REMARKED THAT'S CAPITAL THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO BEAT THAT
THE CULPRIT ENTERED THE VEHICLE IN THE MOST UNCONCERNED MANNER AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS COMPARTMENT LIKE ONE ACCUSTOMED TO IT KNOWING THE MOST COMFORTABLE POSITION TO ASSUME IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS
NOT WISHING TO DISCLOSE THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS ANGER HE ENTERED THE STATION HOUSE SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO SEE THE PRISONER LEFT ALONE THE KEEPER BEGAN TO SWEAR IN HIS TURN THESE POLICE AGENTS ARE ALL ALIKE HE GRUMBLED THEY QUESTION YOU
OR THE KEEPER OF SOME LITTLE SHOP HAVING OBTAINED THIS DESCRIPTION
WHAT KIND OF FELLOW WAS THIS DRUNKARD HE INQUIRED HE WAS TALL AND STOUT WITH FULL RUDDY CHEEKS A PAIR OF WHITE WHISKERS SMALL EYES A BROAD FLAT NOSE AND A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL MANNER
FOR LECOQ COULD DETECT A STRANGE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY WHICH PUZZLED AND ANNOYED HIM ON APPLYING HIS EAR INSTEAD OF HIS EYE TO THE APERTURE HE DISTINGUISHED A STIFLED MOAN THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY DOUBT
FOLLOWED BY HIS CLERK LECOQ ROSE AND HASTENED WELL NIGH BREATHLESS WITH ANXIETY TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE MY RESEARCHES ON THE SPOT SAID THIS FUNCTIONARY CONFIRM ME IN THE BELIEF THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IS THERE ANYTHING FRESH YES SIR
HOPING THAT THE PRISONER'S BEARING MIGHT HELP TO SOLVE HIS DOUBTS ON PEERING THROUGH THE GRATED APERTURE IN THE DOOR OF THE CELL HE PERCEIVED THE PRISONER LYING ON THE PALLET THAT STOOD OPPOSITE THE DOOR HIS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARD THE WALL
AND I MUST GET THE PRISONER OTHER CLOTHING AS THE THINGS HE IS WEARING NOW WILL BE USED AS EVIDENCE LET SOME ONE GO AT ONCE AND TELL THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE VAN MUST WAIT AT THIS MOMENT THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT ENTERED THE OFFICE
WHEN HE WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO THE HUMILIATING FORMALITIES THAT AWAITED HIM FORMALITIES WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES CAN AND MUST
WAS IT ONLY A FANCY WHY MUST I DO THAT ASKED THE CULPRIT TO PASS UNDER THE BEAM REPLIED THE CLERK WE MUST MAKE A NOTE OF YOUR EXACT HEIGHT THE PRISONER MADE NO REPLY
HAD TURNED OFF THE PONT NEUF ON TO THE QUAI DE L'HORLOGE THAT THE YOUNG DETECTIVE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS TRANSPIRING AROUND HIM SOON THE VAN PASSED THROUGH AN OPEN GATEWAY AND DREW UP IN A SMALL DAMP COURTYARD
LECOQ IMMEDIATELY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COMPARTMENT IN WHICH THE SUPPOSED MURDERER WAS CONFINED EXCLAIMING AS HE DID SO HERE WE ARE GET OUT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THE PRISONER ESCAPING THE IRON GATE HAD BEEN CLOSED
BUT SAT DOWN AND DREW OFF HIS HEAVY BOOTS THE HEEL OF THE RIGHT ONE WAS WORN DOWN ON THE INSIDE IT WAS MOREOVER NOTICED THAT THE PRISONER WORE NO SOCKS AND THAT HIS FEET WERE COATED WITH MUD
AND AT LEAST A DOZEN AGENTS WERE STANDING NEAR AT HAND WAITING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEW ARRIVALS THE PRISONER SLOWLY STEPPED TO THE GROUND HIS EXPRESSION OF FACE REMAINED UNCHANGED AND EACH GESTURE EVINCED THE PERFECT INDIFFERENCE
ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF STILL ALIVE SUDDENLY A COUPLE OF BIG TEARS WELLED FROM HIS SWOLLEN EYELIDS AND ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS HE WAS PRESSED WITH QUESTIONS
HAS HE CONFESSED HIS GUILT TO THE MAGISTRATE OR
THE PRISONER TURNED TOWARD ONE OF THE FIVE OR SIX DOORS THAT OPENED INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S HESITATION HE WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARD THE VERY DOORWAY HE WAS EXPECTED TO ENTER
THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THESE HIGH GRIM WALLS THESE GRATED WINDOWS THESE HEAVY DOORS IN SHORT
HE WAS WALKING VERY FAST AND INSTEAD OF APPROACHING THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HE CALLED TO HIM AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE I MUST RETURN HOME AT ONCE HE SAID INSTANTLY I CAN NOT LISTEN TO YOU BUT SIR ENOUGH
THE BODIES OF THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE MORGUE KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT THERE THEN THIS EVENING MAKE WELL DO WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST BUT SIR I MUST TO MORROW TO MORROW AT NINE O'CLOCK IN MY OFFICE IN THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
IT WAS IN A WHEEDLING VOICE AND WITH TEARFUL EYES THAT SHE CALLED UPON THESE GOOD GENTLEMEN TO WITNESS THE SHAMEFUL INJUSTICE WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED SHE AN HONEST WOMAN WAS SHE NOT THE MAINSTAY OF HER FAMILY
CAN IT BE HE MURMURED
THROWN HIMSELF INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND THE COACHMAN WAS ALREADY WHIPPING UP THE HORSE AND TO THINK THAT HE'S AN INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE PANTED LECOQ
YOU MUST SEE
BIG DROPS OF PERSPIRATION STOOD ON LECOQ'S FOREHEAD THIS MAN THOUGHT HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN HERE BEFORE HE KNOWS THE ROPES THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE WAS A LARGE ROOM
WHO SANG AND YELLED HER IMPRECATIONS ALTERNATELY IT IS NEEDLESS HOWEVER TO RECAPITULATE HER OATHS LET US RATHER FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF LECOQ'S MEDITATION BY WHAT MEANS COULD HE SECURE SOME CLUE TO THE MURDERER'S IDENTITY
THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE PRISONERS BEING RECORDED IN ORDER THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR PERSONS MIGHT BE COMPLETE IN EVERY RESPECT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CULPRIT ACCOMPANIED BY LECOQ THE CLERK RAISED HIS HEAD AH SAID HE HAS THE VAN ARRIVED
ANYWHERE ELSE SO STRANGE AND GROTESQUE A PROCEEDING WOULD HAVE EXCITED LAUGHTER BUT HERE IN THIS GLOOMY CHAMBER
AND SPREADING A NEWSPAPER OVER IT HE SAID WILL YOU PLACE YOUR FOOT THERE THE MAN DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUEST IT IS USELESS TO RESIST EXCLAIMED THE GOVERNOR WE ARE IN FORCE THE PRISONER DELAYED NO LONGER
DOES HE INDEED RECOGNIZE THE PLACE AND HIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISQUIETUDE INCREASED
HE WAS ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS AND THE PRISON DOCTOR WHO IMMEDIATELY BLED HIM DECLARED THAT HAD ANOTHER TEN MINUTES ELAPSED HELP WOULD HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE WHEN THE PRISONER REGAINED HIS SENSES HE GAZED AROUND HIM WITH A WILD PUZZLED STARE
IN THIS HE WAS MISTAKEN TWENTY MINUTES LATER
AND HE HAD MANAGED TO DECEIVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED EYES IN PARIS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD WAITED DURING NEARLY THREE HOURS AS MOTIONLESS AS THE BENCH ON WHICH HE WAS SEATED AND SO ABSORBED IN STUDYING HIS CASE THAT HE HAD THOUGHT NEITHER OF THE COLD
STILL BENEATH THIS CYNICAL GAIETY LECOQ THOUGHT HE COULD DETECT POIGNANT ANXIETY CHANCE OWED HIM THE COMPENSATION OF THIS SLIGHT TRIUMPH FOR PREVIOUS EVENTS HAD DECEIVED ALL HIS CALCULATIONS
NOW RESUMED THE CLERK WILL YOU ANSWER BUT THE GOVERNOR PERCEIVED THE FUTILITY OF FURTHER QUESTIONING AND SILENCING THE CLERK BY A GESTURE HE TOLD THE PRISONER TO TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS LECOQ THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN'S GLANCE WAVERED AS HE HEARD THIS ORDER
PRECEDING THE GUARD LIKE SOME OLD HABITUE WHO KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING WHAT A RASCAL EXCLAIMED THE CLERK
HERE ARE YOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX FRANCS AND EIGHT SOUS SAID HE AND ALSO YOUR KNIFE YOUR HANDKERCHIEF AND FOUR CIGARS AN EXPRESSION OF LIVELY CONTENTMENT WAS DISCERNIBLE ON THE PRISONER'S FEATURES
SINCE HER SON POLYTE WAS IN CUSTODY CHARGED WITH POCKET PICKING HENCE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HER DAUGHTER IN LAW AND OF HER GRANDSON TOTO WHO HAD NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER THEM BUT HER STILL WHEN HER NAME HAD BEEN TAKEN AND A KEEPER WAS ORDERED TO REMOVE HER
AN OTHERWISE TRIVIAL ACT IS FRAUGHT WITH SERIOUS IMPORT NOTHING ASTONISHES AND SHOULD A SMILE THREATEN TO CURVE ONE'S LIPS IT IS INSTANTLY REPRESSED ALL THE SPECTATORS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON TO THE KEEPERS
MY HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX FRANCS AND EIGHT SOUS I SHALL NEED THEM WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS PLACE I WANT YOU TO MAKE A NOTE OF THEM ON THE REGISTER WHERE ARE THEY THE MONEY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO LECOQ BY THE KEEPER OF THE STATION HOUSE
HE HAD ALSO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE ENDOWED WITH FAR MORE CLEVERNESS THAN LECOQ HAD SUPPOSED WHAT SELF CONTROL WHAT POWERS OF DISSIMULATION HE HAD DISPLAYED HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS FROWNED WHILE UNDERGOING THE SEVEREST ORDEALS
YOU ONLY WEAR BOOTS ON SUNDAYS THEN REMARKED LECOQ WHY DO YOU THINK THAT BY THE MUD WITH WHICH YOUR FEET ARE COVERED
AFTER ENTERING THE GLOOMY CORRIDOR HE SAW THE CULPRIT PROCEED SOME LITTLE DISTANCE RESOLUTELY TURN TO THE LEFT PASS BY THE KEEPER'S ROOM AND FINALLY ENTER THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE AN OLD OFFENDER COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER
WHO WERE AWAITING THE HOUR FOR ENTERING UPON THEIR DUTIES RECLINED HALF ASLEEP UPON THE WOODEN BENCHES THAT LINED THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM THESE BENCHES WITH A COUPLE OF TABLES AND SOME DILAPIDATED CHAIRS CONSTITUTED THE ENTIRE FURNITURE OF THE OFFICE
SHARED GEVROL'S OPINION LECOQ STOOD ALONE HE DID NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WHAT GOOD WOULD IT HAVE DONE BESIDES THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS JUST BEING BROUGHT IN THE JOURNEY MUST HAVE CALMED HER NERVES FOR SHE HAD BECOME AS GENTLE AS A LAMB
THE PRISONER DID NOT OFFER THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION WHEN HE WAS ORDERED TO UNDRESS AND TO EXCHANGE HIS SOILED AND BLOODSTAINED GARMENTS FOR THE CLOTHING FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT A MUSCLE OF HIS FACE MOVED WHILE HE SUBMITTED HIS PERSON
EITHER SOME FRAGMENT OF GLASS BY THE AID OF WHICH CAPTIVES CAN SEVER THE STRONGEST BARS OR ONE OF THOSE MICROSCOPICAL BITS OF LEAD WITH WHICH PRISONERS WRITE THE NOTES THEY EXCHANGE ROLLED UP IN A MORSEL OF BREAD AND CALLED
THE PRISONER IS KILLING HIMSELF A DOZEN KEEPERS HASTENED TO THE SPOT THE DOOR WAS QUICKLY OPENED AND IT WAS THEN ASCERTAINED THAT THE PRISONER HAVING TORN A STRIP OF BINDING FROM HIS CLOTHES HAD FASTENED IT ROUND HIS NECK AND TRIED TO STRANGLE HIMSELF
POSTILIONS THESE FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN CONCLUDED THE SUPERINTENDENT RANG FOR ONE OF THE KEEPERS CONDUCT THIS MAN TO NO THREE OF THE SECRET CELLS HE ORDERED THERE WAS NO NEED TO DRAG THE PRISONER AWAY HE WALKED OUT AS HE HAD ENTERED
HERE HE TRIED TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS HIS CONVICTIONS WERE UNCHANGED HE WAS MORE THAN EVER CONVINCED THAT THE PRISONER WAS CONCEALING HIS REAL SOCIAL STANDING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
AND THEN ANSWERED SULKILY I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED NOT TIRE YOURSELF BY QUESTIONING ME I SHAN'T ANSWER ANY ONE ELSE BUT THE MAGISTRATE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ME CUT MY OWN THROAT WOULDN'T YOU A VERY CLEVER TRICK OF COURSE
AH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT DECLARED THE GOVERNOR THIS MAN IS CERTAINLY A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL AN OLD OFFENDER I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE I COULD ALMOST SWEAR TO IT THUS IT WAS EVIDENT THESE PEOPLE WITH THEIR LONG VARIED EXPERIENCE
SUCH CONDUCT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE INDEED ALMOST PROBABLE ON THE PART OF A MAN ENDOWED WITH CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH OF WILL AND REALIZING THE IMMINENCE OF HIS PERIL BUT GRANTING THIS WOULD HE BE EQUALLY ABLE TO HIDE HIS FEELINGS
THE CLERK AT ONCE DIPPED HIS PEN IN THE INK AND TURNING TO THE PRISONER HE ASKED WHAT IS YOUR NAME MAY YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME I HAVE NONE
LECOQ HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT IN FRONT BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE GUARD BUT HIS MIND WAS SO ENGROSSED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAT HE HEARD NOTHING OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH WAS VERY JOVIAL
THE GLANCE HE GAVE THE PRISONER WAS POSITIVELY DEFERENTIAL THIS WAS NO COMMON CULPRIT NO ORDINARY VAGABOND NO VULGAR THIEF THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE ORDERS A PRIVATE EXAMINATION CONTINUED THE CLERK
THE DEATH RATTLE WAS SOUNDING IN THE PRISONER'S THROAT
BUT DID NOT VOUCHSAFE SO MUCH AS A SINGLE WORD IN RESPONSE AS HE WAS IN SUCH A DESPERATE FRAME OF MIND AND AS THE ORDERS TO KEEP HIM IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT PREVENTED THE GOVERNOR GIVING HIM A COMPANION
HE WAS STILL CONVINCED THAT THE PRISONER MUST BELONG
HEATED ALMOST TO SUFFOCATION BY AN IMMENSE STOVE AND BADLY LIGHTED BY THREE SMALL WINDOWS THE PANES OF WHICH WERE COVERED WITH A THICK COATING OF DUST THERE SAT THE CLERK READING A NEWSPAPER SPREAD OUT OVER THE OPEN REGISTER
HE FELT SURE THAT THE DISGRACEFUL POSITION IN WHICH THE PRISONER WOULD FIND HIMSELF WOULD CAUSE HIM TO REVOLT TO LOSE HIS SELF CONTROL TO UTTER SOME WORD THAT MIGHT GIVE THE DESIRED CLUE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GLOOMY VEHICLE
NOR OF THE FLIGHT OF TIME WHEN A CARRIAGE DREW UP BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISON
THAT FATAL BOOK IN WHICH ARE INSCRIBED THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHOM MISCONDUCT CRIME MISFORTUNE MADNESS OR ERROR HAVE BROUGHT TO THESE GRIM PORTALS THREE OR FOUR ATTENDANTS
OBSERVED THE GOVERNOR NOT IN THE LEAST I AM INNOCENT YOU WISH TO RUIN ME I ONLY DEFEND MYSELF GET ANYTHING MORE OUT OF ME NOW IF YOU CAN BUT YOU HAD BETTER GIVE ME BACK WHAT THEY TOOK FROM ME AT THE STATION HOUSE
INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE YOU WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME BY AND BY FIRST OF ALL I MUST SUMMARILY EXAMINE THE PRISONERS A MERE MATTER OF FORM FOR TO DAY WAIT FOR ME HERE ALTHOUGH THE MAGISTRATE PROMISED TO MAKE HASTE
AND THEN STRETCHED AND SHOOK HIMSELF AS IF TO REGAIN THE ELASTICITY OF HIS LIMBS CRAMPED BY CONFINEMENT IN THE NARROW COMPARTMENT FROM WHICH HE HAD JUST EMERGED THEN HE GLANCED AROUND HIM AND A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYED UPON HIS LIPS
LECOQ WISHED TO INSIST UPON A HEARING
IN ONE CORNER OF WHICH STOOD A MEASURING MACHINE UNDER WHICH
HE WANDERED THROUGH THE GLOOMY CORRIDORS FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE BUT FINDING HIMSELF ASSAILED WITH QUESTIONS BY EVERY ONE HE CAME ACROSS HE EVENTUALLY LEFT THE DEPOT
WHAT OF THAT EXCLAIMED THE PRISONER IN AN INSOLENT TONE IS IT A CRIME NOT TO HAVE A MARCHIONESS'S FEET IT IS A CRIME YOU ARE NOT GUILTY OF AT ALL EVENTS SAID THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SLOWLY DO YOU THINK I CAN'T SEE
WHICH MAKE THE BLOOD RUSH TO THE FOREHEAD OF THE LOWEST CRIMINAL IT WAS WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE THAT HE ALLOWED AN INSPECTOR TO COMB HIS HAIR AND BEARD AND TO EXAMINE THE INSIDE OF HIS MOUTH SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT CONCEALED
SO THAT BY AND BY HE MAY NOT PRETEND THAT THE DUST HAS BEEN CHANGED THE GOVERNOR COMPLIED WITH THE REQUEST AND AS HE PLACED THIS BIT OF PROOF AS HE STYLED IT IN A SMALL SATCHEL FOR SAFE KEEPING THE PRISONER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A SNEERING LAUGH
HOLDS THE KEY TO THE MYSTERY PERHAPS HE WISHES TO GET RID OF ME THIS SUSPICION WAS SO TERRIBLE
AND SHOWING THE ORDERS SIGNED BY M D'ESCORVAL HE ADDED HERE ARE THIS MAN'S PAPERS THE REGISTRAR TOOK THE DOCUMENTS AND READ THEM OH HE EXCLAIMED A TRIPLE ASSASSINATION OH OH
NATURE REASSERTED ITSELF AND SCARCELY HAD SHE ENTERED THE CORRIDOR THAN SHE WAS HEARD QUARRELING WITH THE GUARD YOU ARE WRONG NOT TO BE POLITE SHE SAID YOU ARE LOSING A GOOD FEE WITHOUT COUNTING MANY A GOOD DRINK I WOULD STAND YOU WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE
AND LECOQ HAD PROBABLY DISCOVERED SOME MEANS OF ATTAINING THIS END THE OPERATION WAS SOON CONCLUDED AND LECOQ SWEPT THE DUST OFF THE PAPER INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND HE DIVIDED IT INTO TWO PARTS ENCLOSING ONE PORTION IN A SCRAP OF PAPER
OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH ORDEALS LECOQ SCRUTINIZED HIS DEMEANOR AS ATTENTIVELY AS AN ANATOMIST MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ACTION OF A MUSCLE HE NOTED THAT THE PRISONER SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A SENSATION OF SATISFACTION
AND THEN WALKED AWAY PUZZLED THOUGHTFUL AND AGITATED INTUITION TOLD HIM THAT THESE MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCES CONCEALED SOME TERRIBLE DRAMA STILL WHAT CAN HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE PRISONER'S ARRIVAL HERE HE MURMURED
AND SLIPPING IT INTO HIS OWN POCKET WITH THE REMAINDER HE FORMED A PACKAGE WHICH HE HANDED TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING I BEG YOU SIR TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS AND TO SEAL IT UP HERE IN PRESENCE OF THE PRISONER THIS FORMALITY IS NECESSARY
HAD WITNESSED MANY OTHER INCIDENTS EQUALLY ABSURD AND NO ONE THOUGHT OF INQUIRING THE DETECTIVE'S MOTIVE THIS MUCH WAS KNOWN ALREADY THAT THE PRISONER WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY NOW IT WAS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH IT AT ANY COST
THAT IF THE MUD WERE PICKED OFF YOUR FEET WOULD BE WHITE AND NEAT THE NAILS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY CUT AND POLISHED HE PAUSED A NEW IDEA INSPIRED BY HIS GENIUS FOR INVESTIGATION HAD JUST CROSSED LECOQ'S MIND
WHAT THIS WOMAN WILL DO I DON'T KNOW IF SHE PROSECUTES YOU AND YOU ARE TRUE TO ME I'LL STAND BY YOU BUT I WON'T STAND ANOTHER FALSE STEP OR A FALSE WORD FROM YOU FERGUSON HAD AGAIN SUNK INTO HIS CHAIR
HIS CLASP OF ALIDA RELAXED HIS ARMS DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND AS HE SANK INTO A CHAIR AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GROANED LOST FOUND OUT YOU MEAN WAS THE WOMAN'S REPLY
STEP BY STEP WITH HORROR STRICKEN EYES ALIDA RETREATED FROM THE MAN TO WHOSE PROTECTION AND EMBRACE SHE HAD FLOWN THEN IT'S TRUE SHE SAID IN A HOARSE WHISPER
TO DECEIVE ME YOU KNOW HOW FALSE ARE YOUR WIFE'S WORDS ABOUT MY EAGERNESS TO BE DECEIVED AND MARRIED BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ME I SHALL NOT PROSECUTE YOU AS SHE SUGGESTS
AND HER TONES WERE SAD AND STERN AS SHE SAID MISTER FERGUSON FROM YOUR MANNER MORE TRULY THAN FROM THIS WOMAN I LEARN THE TRUTH YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY MISFORTUNES MY SORROW AND FRIENDLESSNESS
EXPLAIN SHOW ME THAT THERE'S SOME HORRIBLE MISTAKE LIDA SAID THE MAN LIFTING HIS BLOODLESS FACE IF YOU KNEW ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE SHALL KNOW THEM HALF SHRIEKED THE WOMAN
THE NAME OF THE MAN YOU ARE LIVING WITH IS NOT WILSON OSTROM HIS NAME IS HENRY FERGUSON I AM MISSUS FERGUSON AND I HAVE MY MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO FAINT
WELL I CAN WAIT TILL YOU RECOVER AND TILL HE COMES AND SHE COOLLY SAT DOWN AGAIN ALIDA HAD GLANCED AT THE PROOFS WHICH THE WOMAN HAD THRUST INTO HER HANDS THEN STAGGERED BACK TO A LOUNGE THAT STOOD NEAR
THERE'S ONE LITTLE POINT YOU'LL DO WELL TO CONSIDER SHE CONTINUED IN BITTER SARCASM HE MARRIED ME FIRST I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT SO YOUNG AND INNOCENT AS NOT TO KNOW WHERE THIS FACT PLACES YOU
HE WAS SPEECHLESS YOU ARE WILLFULLY BLIND NOW MISS IF YOU DON'T SEE IT'S TRUE WAS THE STRANGER'S BITING COMMENT PAYING NO HEED TO HER
HE FIRST SAW ALIDA LOOKING PALE AND ILL HE HASTENED TOWARD HER EXCLAIMING WHY LIDA DEAR WHAT IS THE MATTER YOU ARE SICK INSTINCTIVELY SHE SPRANG TO HIS ARMS CRYING OH THANK GOD YOU'VE COME
ALIDA'S EYES RESTED ON THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD BELIEVED TO BE HER HUSBAND SHE TOOK AN IRRESOLUTE STEP TOWARD HIM SPEAK WILSON SHE CRIED I GAVE YOU MY WHOLE FAITH AND NO ONE SHALL DESTROY IT BUT YOURSELF SPEAK
BUT YOU AND HE SHALL LEARN THAT THERE IS A LAW IN THE LAND WHICH WILL PROTECT AN HONEST WOMAN IN HER SACRED RIGHTS YOU NEEDN'T LOOK SO SHOCKED AND BEWILDERED YOU ARE NOT A YOUNG GIDDY GIRL IF I MAY JUDGE FROM YOUR FACE
SHE MIGHT HAVE FAINTED BUT AT THAT AWFUL MOMENT SHE HEARD A FAMILIAR STEP ON THE STAIRS SHE WAS FACING THE DOOR THE TERRIBLE STRANGER SAT AT ONE SIDE WITH HER BACK TOWARD IT WHEN OSTROM ENTERED
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU TOOK UP WITH A STRANGER YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DO YOU KNOW THAT LIKENESS AND SHE DREW FROM HER BOSOM A DAGUERREOTYPE ALIDA WAVED IT AWAY AS SHE SAID INDIGNANTLY
BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND SAT TREMBLING AND SPEECHLESS NEVER FOR AN INSTANT HAD ALIDA TAKEN HER EYES FROM HIM AND NOW WITH A LONG WAILING CRY SHE EXCLAIMED THANK GOD
I'LL FORGIVE AS FAR AS A WRONGED WOMAN CAN FORGIVE
TAKE AWAY THIS AWFUL WOMAN YES HENRY FERGUSON IT'S VERY PROPER YOU SHOULD TAKE ME AWAY FROM A PLACE LIKE THIS AS THE MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIMSELF WILSON OSTROM HEARD THAT VOICE HE TREMBLED LIKE AN ASPEN
YOU DO NOT REALIZE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING OR WHERE YOU ARE TAKE A SEAT NEARER THE FIRE AND WHEN MISTER OSTROM COMES FROM HIS WORK HE'LL TAKE YOU TO YOUR FRIENDS ALL THE WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING
I WON'T BELIEVE ILL OF MY HUSBAND I NO MISS INTERRUPTED THE WOMAN STERNLY YOU ARE RIGHT FOR ONCE YOU WON'T INDEED BELIEVE ILL OF YOUR HUSBAND BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO BELIEVE ILL OF MINE THERE'S NO USE OF YOUR PUTTING ON SUCH AIRS ANY LONGER
YOU NEEDN'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THIS I HAVE PROOF ENOUGH AND NOW HENRY FERGUSON I'VE A FEW WORDS FOR YOU
THANK GOD MOTHER'S DEAD THIS WAS NOW HER BEST CONSOLATION SHE RUSHED INTO HER BEDCHAMBER AND A MOMENT LATER CAME OUT WEARING HER HAT AND CLOAK FERGUSON STARTED UP AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
OR ELSE YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AND VERY EASILY DECEIVED TOO THEY SAY SOME WOMEN ARE SO EAGER TO BE MARRIED THAT THEY ASK NO QUESTIONS BUT JUMP AT THE FIRST CHANCE WHETHER DECEIVED OR DECEIVING IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW
HE COURTED AND WON ME AS OTHER GIRLS ARE COURTED AND MARRIED HE PROMISED ME ALL THAT HE EVER PROMISED YOU THEN WHEN I LOST MY ROSY CHEEKS WHEN I BECAME SICK AND FEEBLE FROM CHILD BEARING HE DESERTED AND LEFT ME ALMOST PENNILESS
AND I CHARGE YOU BEFORE GOD TO DO YOUR DUTY BY YOUR WIFE AND CHILD AND NEVER TO SPEAK TO ME AGAIN TURNING SHE HASTENED TOWARD THE DOOR WHERE ARE YOU GOING FERGUSON EXCLAIMED SEEKING TO INTERCEPT HER SHE WAVED HIM OFF
BUT YOU HENRY FERGUSON HAVE GOT TO DO YOUR DUTY BY ME AND YOUR CHILD OR GO TO PRISON LET ME TELL YOU MISS THAT THIS MAN WAS ALSO MARRIED TO ME BY A MINISTER I HAVE MY CERTIFICATE AND CAN PRODUCE WITNESSES
COLDLY AND DECISIVELY YOU ARE WRONG MISS HOW THAT TITLE GRATED ON ALIDA'S EARS I AM NEITHER INSANE NOR DRUNK I DO KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING AND WHERE I AM YOU ARE PLAYING A BOLD GAME
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE I AND MY BROTHER HAVE TRACKED YOU HERE YOU CAN'T LEAVE THESE ROOMS WITHOUT GOING TO PRISON YOU'D BE TAKEN AT THE VERY DOOR BUT I GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE IF YOU WILL PROMISE BEFORE GOD TO DO YOUR DUTY BY ME AND YOUR CHILD
NO MATTER HOW RASH AND SILLY YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONESTY YOU'LL BE OPEN TO PROOF IF YOU AND HE TRY TO BRAZEN IT OUT THE LAW WILL OPEN BOTH YOUR EYES LOOK AT THAT LIKENESS
I DON'T KNOW SHE REPLIED I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE AND SHE FLED DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND OUT INTO THE DARKNESS THE CHILD HAD NOT WAKENED
AS IF AT LAST STUNG TO FURY I SEE THAT YOU BOTH HOPE TO GET THROUGH THIS AFFAIR WITH A LITTLE HIGH TRAGEDY THEN ESCAPE AND COME TOGETHER AGAIN IN SOME OTHER HIDING PLACE AS FOR THIS CREATURE SHE CAN GO WHERE SHE PLEASES AFTER HEARING THE TRUTH
THE NEXT MORNING HOLCROFT AND ALIDA DROVE TO TOWN AND WENT TO THE CHURCH WHICH SHE AND HER MOTHER USED TO ATTEND AFTER THE SERVICE THEY FOLLOWED THE CLERGYMAN HOME WHERE ALIDA AGAIN TOLD HIM HER STORY THOUGH NOT WITHOUT MUCH HELP FROM THE FARMER
THAT HORRIBLE MAN HAS BEEN HERE THE MAN I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE SHRINK FROM YOU HOLCROFT SOON CAME DRIVING SLOWLY UP THE LANE AS IF NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS ON HIS MIND HAVING TIED HIS HORSES
AS HE EXCLAIMED NO MORE BUSINESS MARRIAGE FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE THERE NEVER WAS A MAN SO IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE SUDDENLY SHE LOOKED UP AND SAID FEARFULLY JAMES HE THREATENED YOU
AND THAT YOU COULDN'T ABIDE ME PERSONALLY SO I TRIED TO KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY AND ALIDA DEAR I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT I WAS TAKEN BY YOUR GOOD TRAITS AND YOUR EDUCATION AND ALL THAT BUT I FOUND OUT AT LAST THAT I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND TOGETHER THEY LOOKED UPON THE JUNE LANDSCAPE WHICH SHE HAD REGARDED WITH SUCH DESPAIRING EYES AN HOUR BEFORE HAPPINESS NEVER KILLS AFTER ALL SHE SAID SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE IF IT DID HE REPLIED
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE CAME TODAY I UNDERSTOOD WHY TOO WELL I CANNOT STAY HERE ANY LONGER YOU'D TRY TO BE KIND AND CONSIDERATE BUT I'D KNOW HOW YOU FELT ALL THE TIME IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE FOR YOU AND IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO STAY EITHER
HE SAID YOU'D NEVER BE SAFE A MOMENT AS LONG AS I STAYED HERE HIS ANSWER WAS A PEAL OF LAUGHTER I'VE DONE MORE THAN THREATEN HIM I'VE WHIPPED HIM WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE
THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND SO HELP ME GOD BUT BUT HE'S BEEN HERE SHE FALTERED YOU DON'T REALIZE I DON'T BELIEVE I DO OR CAN YET ALIDA DEAR
SHE SUNK ON THE LOUNGE AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH SUCH DESPAIRING EYES THAT TEARS CAME INTO HIS OWN ALIDA HE BEGAN HESITATINGLY
SPEAK AND LOOK AS YOU DID BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY JANE
AND STOP THE MOUTHS OF THE CYNICAL AND SCANDAL LOVING ALIDA'S INFLUENCE AND THE FARMER'S BROADENING AND MORE UNSELFISH VIEWS GRADUALLY BOUGHT HIM INTO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS FAITH AND INTO A KINDER SYMPATHY AND CHARITY FOR HIS NEIGHBORS THAN HE HAD EVER KNOWN
SEE HE CRIED I KNEEL TO YOU IN GRATITUDE FOR ALL YOU'VE BEEN TO ME AND ARE TO ME OH JAMES PLEASE RISE IT'S TOO MUCH NO
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY WHO HAS A BETTER RIGHT THAN YOU I'D LIKE TO KNOW DON'T SPEAK THAT WAY SHE SAID ALMOST HARSHLY UNDER THE TENSION OF HER FEELINGS I I CAN'T STAND IT
THERE NEVER WAS A MAN SO TAKEN IN AT HIS MARRIAGE YOU WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I EXPECTED THAT I BEGAN LOVING YOU BEFORE I KNEW IT BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOOD TO ME JUST AS YOU WERE TO JANE FROM A SENSE OF DUTY
I THINK IT WAS THE MAN IN YOU AND THEN YOU STOOD UP FOR ME SO WELL LOVE IS BLIND I SUPPOSE BUT IT DON'T SEEM TO ME THAT MINE IS
THE BIRDS SEEM TO SING AS IF THEY KNEW JANE EMERGED FROM THE BARN DOOR WITH A BASKET OF EGGS AND ALIDA SPED AWAY TO MEET HER THE FIRST THING THE CHILD KNEW THE ARMS OF HER MISTRESS WERE ABOUT HER NECK AND SHE WAS KISSED AGAIN AND AGAIN
WAS TO TELL YOU THAT I HAD LEARNED TO LOVE YOU AND TO THROW MYSELF ON YOUR MERCY
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR SHE ASKED YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOME DAY SAY SAID JANE IN AN IMPULSE OF GOOD WILL IF YOU'RE ONLY HALF MARRIED TO MISTER HOLCROFT
BUT HER EXTREME PALLOR DID AND HE ADDED YOU DON'T LOOK WELL I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING MUCH SUPPER TONIGHT LET JANE DO THE WORK I'D RATHER DO IT SHE REPLIED OH WELL LAUGHING PLEASANTLY
IF YOU'D A SEEN HIM A THRASHIN THAT SCAMP YOU'D KNOW HE'S THE MAN TO TAKE CARE OF YOU YES JANE I KNOW HE'LL TAKE CARE OF ME ALWAYS
AND THAT SETTLES IT BE BE AS KIND TO ME AS YOU CAN A FEW A FEW HOURS LONGER AND THEN LET ME GO QUIETLY HER SELF CONTROL GAVE WAY AND BURYING HER FACE IN HER HANDS SHE SOBBED CONVULSIVELY
AS IF I WERE A LEPER I FEEL AS IF I WERE ONE I SHRINK FROM YOU HE EXCLAIMED YES CAN YOU THINK I HAVEN'T SEEN THE REPUGNANCE GROWING IN SPITE OF YOURSELF WHEN I THOUGHT OF THAT MAN
AND OUR MINDS WILL BE MORE AT REST COME WITH ME INTO THE PARLOR ALIDA WELL PERHAPS THE SOONER IT'S OVER THE BETTER
IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER WITH HIS ARM ABOUT HER WAIST ALIDA DEAR ALIDA HE CRIED WE'VE BOTH BEEN IN THE DARK ABOUT EACH OTHER WHAT I RESOLVED TO DO WHEN I STARTED FOR TOWN
BUT THAT BLESSED JANE'S SPYING TRAIT HAS SERVED ME THE BEST TURN IN THE WORLD SHE HEARD EVERY BRAVE WORD YOU SAID AND I SHED TEARS OF JOY WHEN SHE TOLD ME AND TEARS ARE SLOW COMING TO MY EYES
NO NO SHE CRIED WITH AN IMPLORING GESTURE IF IT MUST BE SAID LET ME SAY IT I COULDN'T ENDURE TO HEAR IT FROM YOU BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL AND THIS AFTERNOON THE TRUTH HAS BEEN BURNED INTO MY SOUL
NOW YOU KNOW ALL YOU FEEL BETTER NOW DON'T YOU YES SHE BREATHED SOFTLY YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH TO WEAR A SAINT OUT HE CONTINUED KINDLY LIE DOWN ON THE LOUNGE AND I'LL BRING YOUR SUPPER TO YOU

AFTER SOME KINDLY REPROACH THAT SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT HER TROUBLES TO HIM AT FIRST THE MINISTER PERFORMED A CEREMONY WHICH FOUND DEEP ECHOES IN BOTH THEIR HEARTS TIME AND RIGHT SENSIBLE LIVING SOON REMOVE PREJUDICE FROM THE HEARTS OF THE GOOD
HE BROUGHT IN AN ARMFUL OF BUNDLES AND SAID KINDLY WELL ALIDA HERE I AM AGAIN AND I GUESS I'VE BROUGHT ENOUGH TO LAST WELL THROUGH HAYING TIME YES SHE REPLIED WITH AVERTED FACE THIS DID NOT TROUBLE HIM ANY NOW
NO PLEASE IT WILL DO ME MORE GOOD TO GO ON AND ACT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED WELL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY LITTLE WIFE YOU'RE BOSS NOW SURE ENOUGH SHE DREW HIM TO THE PORCH
GO AND GATHER THE EGGS AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE HE BEGAN GENTLY ALIDA PLEASE DON'T SPEAK SO TO ME TODAY I'VE ENDURED ALL I CAN I CAN'T KEEP UP ANOTHER MINUTE UNLESS YOU LET THINGS GO ON AS THEY WERE
NOT TILL YOU PROMISE TO GO WITH ME TO A MINISTER AND HEAR ME PROMISE TO LOVE CHERISH YES IN YOUR CASE I'LL PROMISE TO OBEY SHE BOWED HER HEAD UPON HIS SHOULDER IN ANSWER SPRINGING UP HE CLASPED HER CLOSE AND KISSED AWAY HER TEARS

AND I SHAN'T WANT ANY DINNER THE DOOR SHUT AND WAS LOCKED WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A MAN LIKE THAT SAID THE NILGHAI LEAVE HIM ALONE HE'S AS MAD AS A HATTER
MAISIE THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE YEARS HAD TURNED THE CHILD TO A WOMAN BUT THEY HAD NOT ALTERED THE DARK GRAY EYES THE THIN SCARLET LIPS OR THE FIRMLY MODELLED MOUTH AND CHIN
HE'S INTENSELY SUSPICIOUS AND UTTERLY LAWLESS MATTER OF TEMPER SAID THE NILGHAI IT'S THE SAME WITH HORSES SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY WORK
THEN DICK A LITTLE HOARSELY
EVERY PULSE OF DICK'S BODY THROBBED FURIOUSLY AND HIS PALATE DRIED IN HIS MOUTH THE FOG SHUT DOWN AGAIN AND MAISIE'S FACE WAS PEARL WHITE THROUGH IT NO WORD WAS SPOKEN
AN AFFABLE ACTRESS A DEVASTATING CYCLONE OR MINE OWN SWEET SELF AND YOU PRESUME TO LECTURE ME ABOUT MY WORK NILGHAI IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE I'D CARICATURE YOU IN FOUR PAPERS
HE HAD SUFFERED NOW HE WOULD TAKE TOLL OF THE ILLS OF OTHERS THE FOG WAS DRIVEN APART FOR A MOMENT AND THE SUN SHONE A BLOOD RED WAFER ON THE WATER
YOU'RE OUT OF STEP THEN YOU NOTICED IT TOO OF COURSE I DID YOU'RE ALWAYS OUT OF STEP SO I AM I'M SORRY YOU WENT ON WITH THE PAINTING
HE BEGAN BY THINKING OF TORPENHOW'S ADVICE BUT AS OF CUSTOM LOST HIMSELF IN THE STUDY OF THE FACES FLOCKING PAST SOME HAD DEATH WRITTEN ON THEIR FEATURES AND DICK MARVELLED THAT THEY COULD LAUGH
SO I TOLD HIM I DON'T THINK HE BELIEVES IT THEY NEVER DO WHEN THEY FIRST START OFF WHAT'S THAT WRECK ON THE GROUND THERE SPECIMEN OF HIS LATEST IMPERTINENCE
IT IS OF COMMON REPORT THAT YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM SWELLED HEAD HALLOO NILGHAI BACK AGAIN HOW ARE THE BALKANS AND ALL THE LITTLE BALKANS ONE SIDE OF YOUR FACE IS OUT OF DRAWING AS USUAL
HE'S BEGINNING TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH WHAT HE THINKS IS HIS REPUTATION ALREADY BY JOVE HE HAS CHEEK I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIS REPUTATION BUT HE'LL COME A CROPPER IF HE TRIES THAT SORT OF THING
WHY IT ISN'T SEVEN YET SAID TORPENHOW WITH AMAZEMENT IT SHALL BE TWO IN THE MORNING IF I CHOOSE SAID DICK BACKING TO THE STUDIO DOOR I GO TO GRAPPLE WITH A SERIOUS CRISIS
AFTER THE MANNER OF SCHOOLBOYS
NEVER MIND THAT I AM COMMISSIONED TO SMITE YOU IN PRINT TORPENHOW REFUSES FROM FALSE DELICACY I'VE BEEN OVERHAULING THE POT BOILERS IN YOUR STUDIO THEY ARE SIMPLY DISGRACEFUL
OHO THAT'S IT IS IT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN SLATE ME YOU'RE WRONG YOU CAN ONLY DESCRIBE
AND A SHIFT OF THE SAME WIND THAT HAD OPENED THE FOG DROVE ACROSS DICK'S FACE THE BLACK SMOKE OF A RIVER STEAMER AT HER BERTH BELOW THE WALL HE WAS BLINDED FOR THE MOMENT THEN SPUN ROUND AND FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH
YOU'RE SMOKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH
DICK WATCHED THE SPOT TILL HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE TIDE BETWEEN THE PIERS DIE DOWN LIKE THE WASH OF THE SEA AT LOW TIDE
THERE'S MORE IN A WEEK OF LIFE THAN IN A LIVELY WEEKLY NONE THE LESS I'LL SLATE HIM I'LL SLATE HIM PONDEROUSLY IN THE CATACLYSM GOOD LUCK TO YOU BUT I FANCY NOTHING SHORT OF A CROWBAR WOULD MAKE DICK WINCE
BUT KAMI IS IN PARIS SURELY NO HE HAS HIS TEACHING STUDIO IN VITRY SUR MARNE I WORK WITH HIM IN THE SUMMER AND I LIVE IN LONDON IN THE WINTER I'M A HOUSEHOLDER
YOU HAD THREE HUNDRED A YEAR I HAVE THAT STILL I AM PAINTING THAT'S ALL ARE YOU ALONE THEN THERE'S A GIRL LIVING WITH ME DON'T WALK SO FAST DICK
ONLY THE FREE ARE BOND AND ONLY THE BOND ARE FREE TELL HIM HE'S AN IDIOT TORP AND TELL HIM I'M ANOTHER
THE POOR AT LEAST SHOULD SUFFER THAT HE MIGHT LEARN AND THE RICH SHOULD PAY FOR THE OUTPUT OF HIS LEARNING THUS HIS CREDIT IN THE WORLD AND HIS CASH BALANCE AT THE BANK WOULD BE INCREASED SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM
I'D FLAY HIM MYSELF BUT I LIKE HIM TOO MUCH I'VE NO SCRUPLES HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TRY TO CUT ME OUT WITH A WOMAN AT CAIRO ONCE I FORGOT THAT BUT I REMEMBER NOW
IT'S WINDY DIET FOR A COLT I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS DICK MUCH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL A YOUNG WOLF A LION AND EXPECT HIM TO TAKE THE COMPLIMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHIN BONE DICK'S SOUL IS IN THE BANK
DID HE CUT YOU OUT YOU'LL SEE WHEN I HAVE DEALT WITH HIM BUT AFTER ALL WHAT'S THE GOOD LEAVE HIM ALONE AND HE'LL COME HOME IF HE HAS ANY STUFF IN HIM DRAGGING OR WAGGING HIS TAIL BEHIND HIM
HERE'S THE PERORATION FOR WORK DONE WITHOUT CONVICTION FOR POWER WASTED ON TRIVIALITIES FOR LABOUR EXPENDED WITH LEVITY FOR THE DELIBERATE PURPOSE OF WINNING THE EASY APPLAUSE OF A FASHION DRIVEN PUBLIC
I MUST SEE YOU AGAIN AND PERHAPS I COULD HELP YOU I I PAINT A LITTLE MYSELF I MAY BE IN THE PARK TO MORROW IF THERE IS NO WORKING LIGHT
DO YOU SELL MUCH NOW AND AGAIN BUT NOT OFTEN THERE IS MY BUS I MUST TAKE IT OR LOSE HALF AN HOUR GOOD BYE DICK GOOD BYE MAISIE WON'T YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE
HE WAS THE CHIEFEST AS HE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WAR CORRESPONDENTS AND HIS EXPERIENCES DATED FROM THE BIRTH OF THE NEEDLE GUN SAVING ONLY HIS ALLY KENEU THE GREAT WAR EAGLE THERE WAS NO MAN HIGHER IN THE CRAFT THAN HE
BUT DICK FELL INTO STEP AT HER SIDE AND THE TWO PACED THE EMBANKMENT TOGETHER KEEPING THE STEP
THOSE LITTLE STATES ARE ALWAYS SCREECHING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT DICK'S LUCK YES HE HAS BEEN CALLED UP TO NOTORIETY HASN'T HE I HOPE YOU KEEP HIM PROPERLY HUMBLE HE WANTS SUPPRESSING FROM TIME TO TIME HE DOES
AT ELEVEN THERE WAS A KICKING ON THE STUDIO DOOR IS THE NILGHAI WITH YOU STILL SAID A VOICE FROM WITHIN THEN TELL HIM HE MIGHT HAVE CONDENSED THE WHOLE OF HIS LUMBERING NONSENSE INTO AN EPIGRAM
HE THINKS HE IS HIS OWN MASTER DOES HE I COULD UNDECEIVE HIM FOR HIS GOOD IF THERE'S ANY VIRTUE IN PRINT HE WANTS THE WHIPLASH LAY IT ON WITH SCIENCE THEN
DICK HAD INSTINCTIVELY SOUGHT RUNNING WATER FOR A COMFORT TO HIS MOOD OF MIND HE WAS LEANING OVER THE EMBANKMENT WALL WATCHING THE RUSH OF THE THAMES THROUGH THE ARCHES OF WESTMINSTER BRIDGE
THEY HAVE NO ARENAS NOW BUT THEY MUST HAVE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS YOU'RE A FAT GLADIATOR WHO COMES UP THROUGH A TRAP DOOR AND TALKS OF WHAT HE'S SEEN YOU STAND ON PRECISELY THE SAME LEVEL AS AN ENERGETIC BISHOP
THE NILGHAI WINCED HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS AS IT IS I SHALL TAKE THIS STUFF AND TEAR IT SMALL SO THE MANUSCRIPT FLUTTERED IN SLIPS DOWN THE DARK WELL OF THE STAIRCASE
TORPENHOW THRUST THE TORN EDGES OF THE CANVAS TOGETHER AND SHOWED THE WELL GROOMED PICTURE TO THE NILGHAI WHO LOOKED AT IT FOR A MOMENT AND WHISTLED IT'S A CHROMO SAID HE CHROMO LITHOLEOMARGARINE FAKE
YES NO DO YOU MEAN AMOMMA YE ES NO THIS
AS A P AND O CARGO BOAT BUT CONTINUE AND BE SWIFT I'M GOING TO BED
THAT'S HIS LAST SHOT SECOND EDITION GO ON PUBLIC
TORPENHOW LAUGHED AS HE ENTERED
I PAINT A GREAT DEAL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO DO
HE DIED DICK NOT CARTRIDGES OVER EATING HE WAS ALWAYS GREEDY
BUT OF COURSE I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN SHE STEPPED INTO THE OMNIBUS AND WAS SWALLOWED UP BY THE FOG WELL I AM DAMNED EXCLAIMED DICK AND RETURNED TO THE CHAMBERS
OVER THERE HE POINTED EASTWARD THROUGH THE FOG AND YOU OH I'M IN THE NORTH THE BLACK NORTH ACROSS ALL THE PARK I AM VERY BUSY WHAT DO YOU DO
WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO DO IT AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY HE HAS CAUGHT THE NOTE THAT CATCHES A PUBLIC WHO THINK WITH THEIR BOOTS AND READ WITH THEIR ELBOWS THE COLD BLOODED INSOLENCE OF THE WORK ALMOST SAVES IT
SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY JIB AND SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY GO OUT FOR A WALK WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DICK HAS DONE SAID TORPENHOW WAIT TILL HE COMES BACK IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR SLATING HERE
IT'S A CLUMSY ENDING AND VILE JOURNALESE BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE AND YET HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SNATCHED AT THE MANUSCRIPT
OF COURSE I SAID I SHOULD I WAS AT THE SLADE THEN AT MERTON'S IN SAINT JOHN'S WOOD THE BIG STUDIO THEN I PEPPER POTTED I MEAN I WENT TO THE NATIONAL AND NOW I'M WORKING UNDER KAMI
THE OBLIVION THAT IS PRECEDED BY TOLERATION AND CENOTAPHED WITH CONTEMPT FROM THAT FATE MISTER HELDAR HAS YET TO PROVE HIMSELF OUT OF DANGER WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW SAID DICK PROFANELY
OTHERS CLUMSY AND COARSE BUILT FOR THE MOST PART WERE ALIGHT WITH LOVE OTHERS WERE MERELY DRAWN AND LINED WITH WORK
HE'S WORKING FOR CASH NOW HE HAS THROWN UP WAR WORK I SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T SEE THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SERVICE ARE JUST THE SAME ONLY THE PROPRIETORS ARE CHANGED HOW SHOULD HE KNOW
GO HOME NILGHAI SAID DICK GO HOME TO YOUR LONELY LITTLE BED AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
REPEATING THE PHRASE WITH AN AWFUL GRAVITY YOU'LL BE MORE DAMNED WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU SAID THE NILGHAI UPHEAVING HIS BULK FROM BEHIND TORPENHOW'S SHOULDER AND WAVING A SHEAF OF HALF DRY MANUSCRIPT DICK
WITH HIS HELMET AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE LIVING FEAR OF DEATH IN HIS EYE AND THE BLOOD OOZING OUT OF A CUT OVER HIS ANKLE BONE HE WASN'T PRETTY BUT HE WAS ALL SOLDIER AND VERY MUCH MAN
THUS THE CANVAS RIPPED AS TORPENHOW'S BOOTED FOOT SHOT THROUGH IT AND THE TERRIER JUMPED DOWN THINKING RATS WERE ABOUT IF YOU HAVE ANY BAD LANGUAGE TO USE USE IT YOU HAVE NOT I CONTINUE
DICKIE YOU'VE BEEN PROMENADING AMONG THE TOY SHOPS AND HEARING PEOPLE TALK
AND YOU HAD TO MAKE THE BEST YOU COULD OF THAT HE HAD A DIVINE TOUCH AND HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT COLOUR
YOU'VE LEARNT SOMETHING WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY WHAT IS ART GIVE EM WHAT THEY KNOW AND WHEN YOU'VE DONE IT ONCE DO IT AGAIN DICK DRAGGED FORWARD A CANVAS LAID FACE TO THE WALL
SAID TORPENHOW WITH A PROVOKING DRAWL DICK SQUIRMED IN HIS PLACE DON'T IT MAKES ME WANT TO GET OUT THERE AGAIN WHAT COLOUR THAT WAS OPAL AND UMBER AND AMBER AND CLARET AND BRICK RED AND SULPHUR
OH CONFOUND YOUR PARALLELS WHENEVER I TRY TO IMPROVE YOUR SOUL YOU ALWAYS DRAG IN SOME ANECDOTE FROM YOUR VERY SHADY PAST PIGS AREN'T THE BRITISH PUBLIC AND SELF RESPECT IS SELF RESPECT THE WORLD OVER
BUT HE NEVER SEEMED TO DO MUCH EXCEPT FUDGE HIS REPORTS FROM THE NILGHAI SEE DEAR OLD NILGHAI HE'S IN TOWN FATTER THAN EVER HE OUGHT TO BE UP HERE THIS EVENING I SEE THE COMPARISON PERFECTLY
WELL I LURED MY MODEL A BEAUTIFUL RIFLEMAN UP HERE WITH DRINK I DRORED HIM AND I REDRORED HIM AND I REDRORED HIM AND I MADE HIM A FLUSHED DISHEVELLED BEDEVILLED SCALLAWAG
WHAT DOES YOUR MAJESTY PLEASE TO WANT YOU CAN'T SMOKE MORE THAN YOU DO YOU WON'T DRINK YOU'RE A GROSS FEEDER AND YOU DRESS IN THE DARK BY THE LOOK OF YOU YOU WOULDN'T KEEP A HORSE THE OTHER DAY WHEN I SUGGESTED
I COULD HAVE SAID A GOOD DEAL
YOU'RE SO ABOMINABLY REASONABLE THERE WILL BE A ROW ON DICKENSON'S WEEKLY I FANCY WHY THE DICKENSON DO YOU WANT TO WORK ON A WEEKLY PAPER IT'S SLOW BLEEDING OF POWER
WHEN WERE YOU UNDER KAMI MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY BEGINNINGS I STUDIED WITH HIM FOR TWO YEARS IN PARIS HE TAUGHT BY PERSONAL MAGNETISM
DICK POINTED TO THE YELLOW FOG IF THEY WANT FURNITURE POLISH LET THEM HAVE FURNITURE POLISH SO LONG AS THEY PAY FOR IT THEY ARE ONLY MEN AND WOMEN YOU TALK AS IF THEY WERE GODS
IT BRINGS IN THE VERY DESIRABLE DOLLARS SAID DICK HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS TORPENHOW WATCHED HIM WITH LARGE CONTEMPT WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS A MAN SAID HE IT'S A CHILD
AS IF THEIR SOULS MATTERED I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT ART AND SEEN LESS OF HER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAN IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE DO YOU REMEMBER CASSAVETTI WHO WORKED FOR SOME CONTINENTAL SYNDICATE OUT WITH THE DESERT COLUMN
NO IT ISN'T SAID DICK WHEELING QUICKLY
I TOOK MY LAST SHOT BACK BEHOLD THE RESULT
HE WAS A REGULAR CHRISTMAS TREE OF CONTRAPTIONS WHEN HE TOOK THE FIELD IN FULL FIG WITH HIS WATER BOTTLE LANYARD REVOLVER WRITING CASE HOUSEWIFE GIG LAMPS AND THE LORD KNOWS WHAT ALL HE USED TO FIDDLE ABOUT WITH EM AND SHOW US HOW THEY WORKED
PIG CHINESE PIG I'VE WORKED FOR THIS I'VE SWEATED AND I'VE STARVED FOR THIS LINE ON LINE AND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND NOW I'VE GOT IT I AM GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT WHILE IT LASTS LET THEM PAY THEY'VE NO KNOWLEDGE
IT'S THERE BLESS ITS GOLDEN HEART SAID DICK IT'S THERE ALL THE TIME PROVIDENCE HAS SENT ME NUTS WHILE I HAVE TEETH TO CRACK EM WITH I HAVEN'T YET FOUND THE NUT I WISH TO CRACK BUT I'M KEEPING MY TEETH FILED
THAT IS ART I POLISHED HIS BOOTS OBSERVE THE HIGH LIGHT ON THE TOE THAT IS ART I CLEANED HIS RIFLE RIFLES ARE ALWAYS CLEAN ON SERVICE BECAUSE THAT IS ART I PIPECLAYED HIS HELMET
YOU ARE AN IDIOT BECAUSE NO MAN BORN OF WOMAN IS STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH HIS PUBLIC EVEN THOUGH THEY BE WHICH THEY AIN'T ALL YOU SAY THEY ARE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER
YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT CLEAR OF ALL THAT MAN MILLINERY SERVES YOU RIGHT AND I HOPE IT WILL UNSETTLE YOUR MIND IT WON'T IT HAS TAUGHT ME WHAT ART HOLY SACRED ART MEANS
I'D LET YOU GO TO THE DEUCE ON YOUR OWN MAHL STICK BUT WHEN I CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE TO ME AND WHEN I FIND THAT TO VANITY
COCKATOO CREST SULPHUR AGAINST BROWN WITH A NIGGER BLACK ROCK STICKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL AND A DECORATIVE FRIEZE OF CAMELS FESTOONING IN FRONT OF A PURE PALE TURQUOISE SKY HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN AND YET YOU KNOW
THEN THE ART MANAGER OF THAT ABANDONED PAPER SAID THAT HIS SUBSCRIBERS WOULDN'T LIKE IT IT WAS BRUTAL AND COARSE AND VIOLENT MAN BEING NATURALLY GENTLE WHEN HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE THEY WANTED SOMETHING MORE RESTFUL
PIPECLAY IS ALWAYS USED ON ACTIVE SERVICE AND IS INDISPENSABLE TO ART I SHAVED HIS CHIN I WASHED HIS HANDS AND GAVE HIM AN AIR OF FATTED PEACE RESULT MILITARY TAILOR'S PATTERN PLATE PRICE THANK HEAVEN
BECAUSE YOU SAID IT MIGHT FALL LAME AND WHENEVER YOU CROSS THE STREET YOU TAKE A HANSOM EVEN YOU ARE NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE THAT THEATRES AND ALL THE LIVE THINGS YOU CAN BUY THEREABOUTS MEAN LIFE WHAT EARTHLY NEED HAVE YOU FOR MONEY
AND IT WAS LONELY THESE LONG EVENINGS A MAN CAN'T WORK FOR EVER A MAN MIGHT HAVE GONE TO A PUB AND GOT DECENTLY DRUNK I WISH I HAD BUT I FORGATHERED WITH SOME MEN OF SORTS
I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE FOR ALL THE GOLD IN ENGLAND THAT'S SETTLED NOW SWEAR DON'T KNOW SAID DICK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF ANGRY BUT I CAN'T
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT THING OUT AS YOUR WORK WHY NOT I DID IT ALONE I DID IT IN THE INTERESTS OF SACRED HOME BRED ART AND DICKENSON'S WEEKLY
THEY SAID THEY WERE ARTISTS AND I KNEW SOME OF THEM COULD DRAW BUT THEY WOULDN'T DRAW THEY GAVE ME TEA TEA AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND TALKED ABOUT ART AND THE STATE OF THEIR SOULS
GO OUT FOR A WALK AND TRY TO CATCH SOME SELF RESPECT AND I SAY IF THE NILGHAI COMES UP THIS EVENING CAN I SHOW HIM YOUR DIGGINGS
PERHAPS SOME DAY YOU AND I WILL GO FOR A WALK ROUND THE WIDE EARTH WITH NO WORK TO DO NOBODY TO WORRY US AND NOBODY TO COMPETE WITH YOU WOULD BE UNFIT TO SPEAK TO IN A WEEK BESIDES
ONCE MORE MODEST CHILD DICK LAUGHED WELL IT'S ONLY TO YOU I'M TALKING I DID HIM JUST AS WELL AS I KNEW HOW MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR THE SLICKNESS OF OILS
I SHOULDN'T GO I DON'T CARE TO PROFIT BY THE PRICE OF A MAN'S SOUL FOR THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD MEAN DICK IT'S NO USE ARGUING YOU'RE A FOOL DON'T SEE IT WHEN I WAS ON THAT CHINESE PIG BOAT
ON EASILY ACQUIRED MONEY FOR THAT MONEY AND YOUR OWN INFERNAL VANITY YOU ARE WILLING TO DELIBERATELY TURN OUT BAD WORK YOU'LL DO QUITE ENOUGH BAD WORK WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND DICKIE AS I LOVE YOU AND AS I KNOW YOU LOVE ME
OUR CAPTAIN GOT CREDIT FOR SAVING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VERY SEASICK LITTLE PIGS WHEN OUR OLD TRAMP OF A STEAMER FELL FOUL OF A TIMBER JUNK NOW TAKING THOSE PIGS AS A PARALLEL
HERE'S A SAMPLE OF REAL ART IT'S GOING TO BE A FACSIMILE REPRODUCTION FOR A WEEKLY I CALLED IT HIS LAST SHOT IT'S WORKED UP FROM THE LITTLE WATER COLOUR I MADE OUTSIDE EL MAGHRIB
OR WITH YOURSELF WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT MOREOVER COME BACK BINKIE THAT RED DAUB ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE UNLESS YOU TAKE PRECIOUS GOOD CARE YOU WILL FALL UNDER THE DAMNATION OF THE CHECK BOOK AND THAT'S WORSE THAN DEATH
THAT SOUNDS VERY FINE BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE THEY ARE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DO WORK FOR WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THEY ARE YOUR MASTERS DON'T BE DECEIVED DICKIE YOU AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO TRIFLE WITH THEM
TORPENHOW SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE THEN CAME THE VERDICT DELIVERED FROM ROLLING CLOUDS IF YOU WERE ONLY A MASS OF BLATHERING VANITY DICK I WOULDN'T MIND
MODEST MAN GO ON
WHICH WAS THE MOST BITTER TO HER OF ALL CAME FROM HER ASSURANCE THAT HIS LOVE FOR THAT OTHER GIRL WAS SO GENUINE EVEN WHEN HE WAS WRITING TO HER THERE WAS NO SPARK LEFT OF THE OLD ROMANCE SOME HINT OF A RECOLLECTION OF PAST FEELINGS
AND THINKING IT TO BE A GOOD LETTER SHE DETERMINED TO SHOW IT TO THE DUKE MISTER TREGEAR HAS GOT IN AT POLPENNO SHE SAID ON THE DAY ON WHICH SHE AND THE DUKE HAD RECEIVED THEIR LETTERS SO I HEAR FROM SILVERBRIDGE
I HAVE SOMETIMES REGARDED MYSELF AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST PECULIARLY UNFORTUNATE MEN IN THE WORLD AND YET NOW I HAVE ACHIEVED THAT WHICH ALL COMMONERS IN ENGLAND THINK TO BE THE GREATEST HONOUR WITHIN THEIR REACH
AMONG US ALL WE HAVE MANAGED TO RETURN TREGEAR I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT BE QUITE PLEASED BECAUSE IT WILL BE A VOTE LOST TO YOUR PARTY BUT I REALLY THINK THAT HE IS JUST THE FELLOW TO BE IN PARLIAMENT
THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT WHETHER A MAN IS A CONSERVATIVE OR NOT HIMSELF I SUPPOSE THERE OUGHT TO BE CONSERVATIVES
WHICH ALSO GAVE RISE TO SOME MENTAL MEMORANDA IT WAS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR MABEL I AM A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS
HE HAD TO READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH TWICE BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE DID READ IT TWICE AND THEN FOLDING THE LETTER VERY SLOWLY GAVE IT BACK TO HIS COMPANION WHAT OUGHT I TO DO ASKED LADY MABEL
MAY I TELL YOU WHY I SAY ALL THIS SHE ASKED SOFTLY PRESSING HER HAND ON THE DUKE'S ARM EVER SO GENTLY TO THIS THE DUKE ASSENTED BUT STILL COLDLY BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
HE SURELY WOULD WIN HIS GOOD THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT WHAT GOOD THINGS WERE IN STORE FOR HER WHAT CHANCE OF SUCCESS WAS THERE FOR HER BUT THE REFLECTION
IT WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM I SUPPOSE I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE DUKE COLDLY HE IS MY COUSIN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS WELFARE THAT IS NATURAL
WOULD YOU MIND READING THAT LETTER OF COURSE YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT FRANK AND I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ALMOST AS BROTHER AND SISTER THE DUKE TOOK THE LETTER IN HIS HAND AND DID READ IT VERY SLOWLY
AND HAVE DONE SO AT AN AGE AT WHICH VERY FEW ACHIEVE IT BUT THE SONS OF THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL I NOW COME TO MY MISFORTUNES I KNOW THAT AS A POOR MAN I OUGHT NOT TO BE A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
I HAVE PROMISED TO GO UP TO TOWN WITH TREGEAR FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THAT I WILL STICK TO MY PURPOSE OF GOING TO MATCHING AGAIN I WILL BE THERE ABOUT THE TWENTY SECOND AND WILL THEN STAY OVER CHRISTMAS
SOME HALF CONCEALED REFERENCE TO THE FORMER PASSION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HIM SHE AS A WOMAN AS A WOMAN ALL WHOSE FORTUNE MUST DEPEND ON MARRIAGE COULD INDULGE IN NO SUCH ALLUSIONS BUT SURELY HE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO HARD
HERE THERE WAS A VERY GRAVE MEMORANDUM SPEECHES EASY TO YOUNG SPEAKERS ARE GENERALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO OLD LISTENERS BUT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL BOSH THIS REQUIRED NO SEPARATE MEMORANDUM
THE MODE OF DISTRIBUTING THE MONEY HAD BEEN ARRANGED BUT THE CONSERVATIVE TAILOR HAD BEEN TOO ACUTE AND NOT HALF A SOVEREIGN COULD BE PASSED THE TAILOR GOT TWENTY FIVE POUNDS FOR HIS WORK AND THAT WAS SMUGGLED IN AMONG THE BILLS FOR PRINTING
IT WAS BEASTLY WORK THE DUKE MADE ANOTHER MEMORANDUM TO INSTRUCT HIS SON THAT NO GENTLEMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF A SCHOOLBOY SHOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO USE SUCH A WORD IN SUCH A SENSE
YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THAT IS TELL HER THAT MY PRIDE IN BEING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS MUCH MORE ON HER BEHALF THAN ON MY OWN THE MAN WHO DARES TO LOVE HER OUGHT AT ANY RATE TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD IF IT MIGHT BE
THE LAST SENTENCE GAVE RISE IN THE DUKE'S MIND TO THE NECESSITY OF A VERY ELABORATE MEMORANDUM ON THE SUBJECT OF AMUSEMENTS GENERALLY BY THE SAME POST ANOTHER LETTER WENT FROM POLPENNO TO MATCHING
WHOSE ASSISTANCE AT SUCH PERIODS HAD LONG BEEN IN REQUISITION HE KNEW VERY WELL HOW THE SEAT HAD BEEN SECURED TEN SHILLINGS A HEAD WOULD HAVE SENT THREE HUNDRED TRUE LIBERALS TO THE BALLOT BOXES
ONE AS TO THE SLANG AND ANOTHER AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF TEACHING SOMETHING TO THE POOR VOTERS ON SUCH OCCASIONS OUR ONLY COMFORT WAS THAT THE CARBOTTLE PEOPLE WERE QUITE AS BADLY OFF AS US
AS YOU AND I MY DEAR ARE FRIENDS I THINK THAT ANY CARRYING OF A MESSAGE TO MARY WOULD BE BREAKING CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO MARY ABOUT MISTER TREGEAR THEN HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOUNG MEN WITHOUT MEANS GOING INTO PARLIAMENT IS TRUE ENOUGH THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING BUT AS THE DUKE WENT ON READING MABEL DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ARGUE THE MATTER
THERE WERE NINE DAYS OF THIS WORK DURING WHICH LORD SILVERBRIDGE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND MADE MANY SPEECHES TREGEAR DID NOT WIN HALF SO MANY HEARTS OR RECOMMEND HIMSELF SO THOROUGHLY TO THE POLITICAL PREDILECTIONS OF THE BOROUGH
MISTER WILLIAMS HOWEVER WAS SURE THAT HE HAD SO OPENED OUT THE INIQUITIES OF THE DISSENTERS AS TO HAVE CONVINCED THE BOROUGH YES EVERY SALEM AND ZION AND EBENEZER IN HIS LARGE PARISH WOULD BE CLOSED
AND A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT WILL GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO CERTAINLY IT OUGHT SAID THE DUKE I DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN IDLE MAN TO THIS THE DUKE MADE NO ANSWER HE DID NOT WISH TO BE MADE TO TALK ABOUT TREGEAR
IT WAS HE WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN EFFICACIOUS IN EVERY ATTEMPT THEY HAD MADE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY THEY HAD BEEN LOOKED INTO AND CIRCUMVENTED AS MISTER CARBOTTLE HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO POLPENNO ON PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT SPEND MONEY
IF EVER IT MAY BE I SHOULD WISH TO BE SOMETHING FOR HER SAKE I AM SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD OF MY SUCCESS YOURSELF FOR MY OWN SAKE YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND COUSIN FRANCIS TREGEAR
THE DUKE AS HE READ THIS MADE A MEMORANDUM IN HIS OWN MIND THAT HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HIS SON THAT EVERY CARRIAGE SHOULD HAVE A DRAG TO ITS WHEELS BUT THAT AN AMBITIOUS SOUL WOULD CHOOSE TO BE THE COACHMAN RATHER THAN THE DRAG
THAT EVENING BEFORE HE WENT TO BED LORD SILVERBRIDGE WROTE TO HIS FATHER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT POLPENNO POLWENNING FIFTEENTH DECEMBER MY DEAR FATHER
BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS RETURNED IT WOULD PROBABLY BE UNJUST TO ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS CHIEFLY TO THE YOUNG LORD'S ELOQUENCE IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT DUE TO THE STRONG RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF THE RECTOR
BUT STILL THERE WAS ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT SHE WOULD DO ALL THAT HE DESIRED AS FAR AS IT WAS IN HER POWER SHE WAS ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD MARRY LADY MARY PALLISER
THOUGH SO ANXIOUS ALSO THAT SOMETHING OF HIS LOVE SHOULD REMAIN WITH HERSELF SHE WAS QUITE WILLING TO CONVEY THAT MESSAGE IF IT MIGHT BE DONE WITHOUT OFFENCE TO THE DUKE SHE WAS THERE WITH THE OBJECT OF INGRATIATING HERSELF WITH THE DUKE
I OUGHT TO BE EARNING MY BREAD AS A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE WHAT I AM AND WHEN I AM FORTY I SHALL FIND THAT I HAVE EATEN UP ALL MY GOOD THINGS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM TO EAT I HAVE ONE CHANCE BEFORE ME
ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AS TO THE GRAMMAR THE ABSENCE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY DID NOT AT THE MOMENT AFFECT THE DUKE I MADE EVER SO MANY SPEECHES TILL AT LAST IT SEEMED TO BE QUITE EASY
AFTER THAT I AM GOING INTO THE BRAKE COUNTRY FOR SOME HUNTING IT IS SUCH A SHAME TO HAVE A LOT OF HORSES AND NEVER TO RIDE THEM YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE SON SILVERBRIDGE
OF THIS BOROUGH WHOM SHOULD THEY ELECT BUT A TREGEAR SAID THE MOTHER FEELING THAT HER RECTOR TOOK TOO MUCH OF THE PRAISE TO HIMSELF I THINK YOU HAVE DONE MORE FOR US THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHISPERED MISS TREGEAR TO THE YOUNG LORD
SHE MUST NOT IMPEDE HER FAVOUR WITH THE DUKE BY MAKING HERSELF THE MEDIUM OF ANY SECRET COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MARY AND HER LOVER BUT HOW SHOULD SHE SERVE TREGEAR WITHOUT RISK OF OFFENDING THE DUKE SHE READ THE LETTER AGAIN AND AGAIN
WE HAD TO GO ABOUT IN THE RAIN UP TO OUR KNEES IN MUD FOR EIGHT OR NINE DAYS ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME THING AND OF COURSE ALL THAT WE SAID WAS BOSH ANOTHER MEMORANDUM OR RATHER TWO
AS HE HAD NOTHING BUT HIS MONEY TO RECOMMEND HIM AND AS HE HAD NOT SPENT IT THE FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF THE BOROUGH HAD NOT SEEN THEIR WAY TO VOTE FOR HIM THEREFORE THE CONSERVATIVES WERE VERY ELATE WITH THEIR TRIUMPH
WHAT YOU SAID WAS SO REASSURING THE FATHER BEFORE HE WENT TO BED EXPRESSED TO HIS SON WITH SOME TREPIDATION A HOPE THAT ALL THIS WOULD LEAD TO NO GREAT PERMANENT INCREASE OF EXPENDITURE
IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT EVEN THE THOUGHTFUL POLITICAL CONVICTIONS OF THE CANDIDATE DID NOT ALTOGETHER PRODUCE THE RESULT IT WAS THAT CHIEF MAN AMONG THE CANDIDATE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS THAT LEADING PHILOSOPHER
WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW ANYBODY TO GO HOME FROM THE RAIN AND WHO KEPT HIS EYES SO SHARPLY OPEN TO THE PECUNIARY DOINGS OF THE CARBOTTLEITES THAT MISTER CARBOTTLE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS HAD HARDLY DARED TO SPEND A SHILLING
THE FIRST MENTAL MEMORANDUM IN REGARD TO THIS CAME FROM THE WRITER'S ASSERTION THAT HE AT FORTY WOULD HAVE EATEN UP ALL HIS GOOD THINGS NO HE BEING A MAN MIGHT MAKE HIS WAY TO GOOD THINGS THOUGH HE WAS NOT BORN TO THEM
IT IS A GREAT THING FOR THE COUNTRY SAID MISTER WILLIAMS HE'LL MAKE A CAPITAL MEMBER SAID SILVERBRIDGE CLAPPING HIS FRIEND ON THE BACK I HOPE HE'LL NEVER FORGET SAID MISTER WILLIAMS
THERE WAS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE REACTION BUT THE ELECTIONEERING GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND IN THE HUMBLE RETIREMENT OF HIS OWN HOME HE WAS A TAILOR IN THE TOWN
IF HE WERE ON YOUR SIDE I'M SURE HE'S THE KIND OF MAN YOU'D LIKE TO BRING INTO OFFICE HE IS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THOSE SORT OF THINGS HE SAYS THAT IF THERE WERE NO CONSERVATIVES SUCH LIBERALS AS YOU AND MISTER MONK WOULD BE DESTROYED BY THE JACOBINS
HAVE YOU ASKED HER NO SIR BUT NOBODY EVER DID LIKE GATHERUM I SUPPOSE NOT AND YET SILVERBRIDGE WHAT A SUM OF MONEY IT COST I BELIEVE IT DID
HOW CAN I ANSWER FOR HER ONLY IT WAS SO PLEASANT FOR ME TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD APPROVE IF IT SHOULD COME OFF YES I WILL APPROVE WHEN SHE HAS ACCEPTED YOU BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL
LORD SILVERBRIDGE SAT IN THE HOUSE OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY IN THE SMOKING ROOM OF THE HOUSE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THINKING OVER ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS FATHER
THIS HE SAID WITH NO TONE OF ANGER IN HIS VOICE SO GENTLY THAT SILVERBRIDGE AT FIRST HARDLY UNDERSTOOD IT BUT GRADUALLY ALL THAT WAS MEANT CAME IN UPON HIM AND HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
BUT BEFORE HE DID SO HE SAID ANOTHER WORD LEANING ON HIS SON'S SHOULDER I DO NOT THINK THAT MABEL GREX AND MAJOR TIFTO WOULD DO WELL TOGETHER AT ALL THERE SHALL BE AN END TO THAT SIR GOD BLESS YOU MY BOY SAID THE DUKE
BUT I NEVER SAW A ORSE SO BAD RIDDEN I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING MY LORD DUKE AGAINST THE MAN BUT IF THAT FELLOW HADN'T BEEN SQUARED OR ELSE WASN'T DRUNK OR ELSE WASN'T OFF HIS HEAD THAT ORSE MUST HAVE WON MY LORD DUKE
BUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IT HAD ALL COME OUT NOW AT ANY RATE IT WAS DECIDED FOR HIM THAT HE MUST IN SET TERMS ASK HER TO BE HIS WIFE THE SCENE WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED HAD MADE HIM THOROUGHLY SICK OF MAJOR TIFTO
IF YOU ASSOCIATE WITH HIM NOT FOR PLEASURE THEN IT SURELY MUST BE FOR PROFIT THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE FORMER WOULD BE TO ME SO SURPRISING THAT I MUST REGARD IT AS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE LATTER IS I THINK A REPROACH
WHEN IT IS SETTLED LET ME KNOW AT ONCE BUT IF IT SHOULD NEVER BE SETTLED I WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS BUT IF IT BE SETTLED TELL ME THEN IN PALACE YARD HE WAS TURNING TO GO
THE HORNS WAS GIVEN EXPRESSLY BY MY UNCLE TO YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND I SHOULD LIKE MARY TO HAVE THE PLACE CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD LIVE AMONG YOUR TENANTRY I DON'T CARE SO VERY MUCH FOR MATCHING
AND DO THIS ALWAYS ON THE SQUARE AND THEN BE SNUBBED FOR DOING IT I AM VERY SORRY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE COME IN TO TROUBLE YOU SAID THE SON HE HAS NOT TROUBLED ME MUCH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TROUBLED YOU
I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RACING MAJOR TIFTO I SUPPOSE NOT YOUR GRACE BUT AS I AND SILVERBRIDGE ARE TOGETHER IN THIS MATTER I THOUGHT I'D JUST LET YOUR GRACE KNOW THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD THING
SO I DO ANYTHING THAT INTERESTS HIM INTERESTS ME BUT PERHAPS OF ALL HIS PURSUITS RACING IS THE ONE TO WHICH I AM LEAST ABLE TO LEND AN ATTENTIVE EAR THAT EVERY HORSE HAS A HEAD
IF SHE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I WILL GO TO HER AT ONCE IT WILL BE MUCH TO HAVE A NEW DAUGHTER VERY MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A WIFE WHERE WOULD SHE LIKE TO LIVE
IT IS THE ONE PLACE YOU DO LIKE SIR HOWEVER WE CAN MANAGE ALL THAT CARLTON TERRACE I DO NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT IT IS A GOOD HOUSE
I THOUGHT MY LORD DUKE YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT LEARNING HOW SILVERBRIDGE WAS GOING ON THIS THE POOR LITTLE MAN SAID ALMOST WITH A WHINE HIS PARTNER'S ROUGHNESS HAD KNOCKED OUT OF HIM NEARLY ALL THE COURAGE WHICH BACCHUS HAD GIVEN HIM
HE IS BAD HE SAID AT LAST WHETHER HE BE BAD I WILL NOT SAY BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU CAN GAIN NOTHING BY HIS COMPANIONSHIP I WILL GET RID OF HIM SAID SILVERBRIDGE AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE
I DARE SAY NOT I DARE SAY NOT SAID THE DUKE GATHERUM IS ALWAYS THOUGHT TO BE DULL
I THINK YOU ARE A LITTLE HARD UPON YOUR FRIEND SAID THE DUKE WITH AN ATTEMPT AT A LAUGH
I DO NOT DENY THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WELL BUT SO ALSO IS YOUR GROOM LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM AND SO IT IS TO BE MABEL GREX I DID NOT SAY SO SIR
HAVING BEEN MADE SUPREMELY HAPPY BY WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN THE DUKE'S JOKE NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD REMEMBER THE SNUBBING AND WOULD BE EVEN WITH SILVERBRIDGE SOME DAY DID LORD SILVERBRIDGE THINK THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOOK AFTER HIS LORDSHIP'S ORSES
UPON MY WORD THAT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME I WILL DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF WISHING YOUR GRACE GOOD NIGHT BY BYE SILVERBRIDGE THEN HE LEFT THE ROOM
IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN I WILL WALK WITH YOU SILVERBRIDGE OF COURSE HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEY STARTED TOGETHER
ALL VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT THE DUKE NO DOUBT WAS THINKING OF CERTAIN SCENES PASSED AT THE GREAT HOUSE IN QUESTION WHICH SCENES HAD NOT BEEN DELIGHTFUL TO HIM NO I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD WISH TO LIVE AT GATHERUM
HE MUST GET RID OF THE MAJOR AND THERE COULD BE NO WAY OF DOING THIS AT ONCE SO EASY AND SO LITTLE OPEN TO OBSERVATION AS MARRIAGE IF HE WERE BUT ONCE ENGAGED TO MABEL GREX THE DISMISSAL OF TIFTO WOULD BE QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE
YOUR GRACE THAT IS THAT SINCE I'VE SEEN ORSES I'VE NEVER SEEN A ORSE FITTER THAN HIM WHEN HE GOT HIS CANTER THAT MORNING IT WAS NEARLY EVEN BETTING NOT THAT I OR SILVERBRIDGE WERE FOOLS ENOUGH TO PUT ON ANYTHING AT THAT RATE
AND THAT ALL DID HAVE TAILS TILL THEY WERE ILL USED IS THE EXTENT OF MY STABLE KNOWLEDGE VERY GOOD INDEED MY LORD DUKE VERY GOOD INDEED HA HA HA ALL HORSES HAVE HEADS AND ALL HAVE TAILS HEADS AND TAILS
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOUR GRACE MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT TIFTO YOU ARE MAKING AN ASS OF YOURSELF SAID SILVERBRIDGE MAKING AN ASS OF MYSELF EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR YES CONSIDERABLY
OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO A CERTAIN MINISTRY WHICH I WISH IT WAS GOING ON TO DAY INSTEAD OF THE SEEDY LOT WE'VE GOT IN I THINK MY LORD DUKE THAT ANY ONE YOU MAY ASK WILL TELL YOU THAT I KNOW WHAT RUNNING IS WELL I CAN ASSURE YOU
I CANNOT DO SO AT ONCE BUT I WILL DO IT IT WILL BE BETTER I THINK TREGEAR HAS BEEN TELLING ME THE SAME THING IS HE OBJECTIONABLE TO MISTER TREGEAR ASKED THE DUKE OH YES TREGEAR CANNOT BEAR HIM
IT IS SIR BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS IT I THOUGHT THAT A GENTLEMAN ON THE TURF WOULD HAVE A TRAINER FOR THAT PURPOSE NOT A COMPANION YOU MEAN TO IMPLY THAT YOU CAN SAVE MONEY BY LEAGUING YOURSELF WITH MAJOR TIFTO NO SIR INDEED
THAT MAN DID NOT TROUBLE ME SILVERBRIDGE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE MUST NOT BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU I'M NOT VERY PROUD OF HIM SIR BUT I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF ONE'S FRIENDS HE ISN'T MY FRIEND IN THAT WAY AT ALL
IN WHAT WAY THEN HE UNDERSTANDS RACING HE IS THE PARTNER OF YOUR PLEASURE THEN THE MAN IN WHOSE SOCIETY YOU LOVE TO ENJOY THE RECREATION OF THE RACE COURSE
I DID HEAR THAT THE HORSE IN WHICH YOU ARE BOTH INTERESTED HAD FAILED TO WIN THE RACE YES HE DID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CALL HIM YOUR GRACE

NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.flac
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0021.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0021.flac

MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.flac
PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0022.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0022.flac
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.flac
WITH HERACLEITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.flac
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.flac
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0020.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0020.flac
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.flac
THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.flac
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.flac
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.flac
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.flac
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.flac
THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.flac
THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.flac
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.flac
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.flac
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.flac
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.flac
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.flac
THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.flac
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.flac
THE BEHAVIOURIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.flac

OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0009.flac
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IS HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0002.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0002.flac
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0028.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0028.flac
THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.flac
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.flac
IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0013.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0013.flac

WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.flac

REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.flac
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.flac

THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.flac
AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.flac
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.flac
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0004.flac
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.flac

THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.flac
THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.flac
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.flac
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.flac
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.flac
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0031.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0031.flac
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0027.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0027.flac
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.flac
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.flac
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.flac
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0001.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0001.flac
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.flac

IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.flac
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.flac
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.flac
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.flac
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0000.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0000.flac
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.flac
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.flac
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOURIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.flac
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.flac
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0004.flac
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0005.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0005.flac
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0013.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0013.flac
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0007.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0007.flac
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0015.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0015.flac
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0003.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0003.flac
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0008.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0008.flac
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0012.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0012.flac
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0001.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0001.flac
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0011.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0011.flac
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0009.flac
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0010.flac
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0006.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0006.flac
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0000.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0000.flac
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0014.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0014.flac
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0002.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0002.flac
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.flac
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0011.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0011.flac
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0021.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0021.flac
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.flac
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0004.flac
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0020.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0020.flac
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0002.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0002.flac
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0006.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0006.flac
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0001.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0001.flac
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0007.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0007.flac
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0016.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0016.flac
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.flac
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0015.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0015.flac
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABU MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0003.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0003.flac
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0000.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0000.flac

THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0010.flac
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0018.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0018.flac
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0009.flac
BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.flac
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0014.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0014.flac
UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0005.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0005.flac
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.flac
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0005.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0005.flac
BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.flac
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0000.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0000.flac
IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0009.flac
THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0004.flac
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE QUASI PEACEABLE CULTURE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0001.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0001.flac

AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0010.flac
THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0007.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0007.flac
A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0003.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0003.flac

WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0017.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0017.flac
THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF EM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0015.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0015.flac

THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0019.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0019.flac
THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0026.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0026.flac
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0009.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0009.flac

THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0016.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0016.flac

OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0004.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0004.flac
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0033.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0033.flac

IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0035.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0035.flac

THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0028.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0028.flac

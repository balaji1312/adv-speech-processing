THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0025.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0025.flac

SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0048.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0048.flac

EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0013.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0013.flac
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0038.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0038.flac
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0012.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0012.flac
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0036.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0036.flac
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0033.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0033.flac

AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0020.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0020.flac

THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0021.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0021.flac

EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0057.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0057.flac

BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0037.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/4350/9170/4350-9170-0037.flac

THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/3538/142836/3538-142836-0010.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/3538/142836/3538-142836-0010.flac
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/3538/142836/3538-142836-0017.flac,data/LibriSpeech/test-other/3538/142836/3538-142836-0017.flac

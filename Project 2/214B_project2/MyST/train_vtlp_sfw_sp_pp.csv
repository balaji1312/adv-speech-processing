CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/5778/12761/5778-12761-0000.flac,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/5778/12761/5778-12761-0000.flac
BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/5778/12761/5778-12761-0005.flac,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/5778/12761/5778-12761-0005.flac

JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/2514/149482/2514-149482-0008.flac,data/MyST/train/sfw/2/clean/2514/149482/2514-149482-0008.flac

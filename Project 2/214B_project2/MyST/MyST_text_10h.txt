YEAST HAS CELLS THAT ARE ALIVE
THEY NEED OXYGEN TO BREATHE BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING THINGS
ALL PLANTS NEED AIR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BREATHE WITHOUT IT
IT'S SUNLIGHT IT'S SUNLIGHT SLASH ENERGY
BECAUSE YES BECAUSE PLANTS WON'T GROW WITHOUT SUNLIGHT THEY NEED SOME KIND OF ENERGY TO GROW
YES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAUSE THEN THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO GROW
THIS IS FOOD FOOD DOESN'T NEED SUN SUNLIGHT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NEED ENERGY IT ISN'T ALIVE
NO WAIT YES BECAUSE IT NEEDS IT NEEDS
PLANTS CAN GROW FOOD AND VEGETABLES AND PLANT AND FOOD IS
YES BECAUSE PLANTS NEED FOOD OR THEY WON'T GROW PLANTS PRODUCE
IT SHOWS FERTILIZER PLANTS NEED FERTILIZER TO GROW SUCH AS GRASS
DO THEY DO NEED IT
SHELTER IS SOMETHING THAT YOU GET COVERED BY
THEY NEED AIR TO STILL KEEP ALIVE OXYGEN CARBON DIOXIDE THEY NEED ALL OF THOSE THINGS
THEY GET THEIR FOOD FROM THE WATER FROM THE WATER UNDER THE GROUND THAT PEOPLE DOWN ONTO IT
PLANTS DO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE IT BY THE WATER
THAT PLANTS ONLY GOT TWO THINGS THAT IT NEEDED IT NEEDED MORE THINGS FOR IT SUCH AS SUNLIGHT SUNLIGHT SLASH ENERGY
GET ALL IT DIDN'T GET ALL THE THINGS THAT IT NEEDED TO GROW IT WAS MISSING ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT
BECAUSE IT'S MISSING OXYGEN FROM THE AIR IF IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN IT COULDN'T BREATHE AND IT WILL DIE
THAT PLANT IS MOSTLY GROWN BUT IT DIDN'T GROW ALL THE WAY BECAUSE IT WAS MISSING WATER
IT IS MISSING WATER
THE LAST THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ELEMENTS NEEDED TO
THAT MEANS THAT'LL THAT'LL GROW ON AND ON UNTIL IT HAS ALL THE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS TO GROW
I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE LIFE OR PEOPLE'S BODY PARTS
IT'S A PERSON AND IT HAS THESE BLUE PARTS THAT ARE SHOWING DIFFERENT KINDS OF CELLS LIKE A BRAIN CELL
MUSCLE CELLS ARE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU MUSCLE
IT'S SHOWING DIFFERENT BRAIN CELLS IN THE BRAIN AND THOSE BRAIN CELLS ARE PROBABLY THINKING THEY ARE THINKING OF
IT IS TRYING TO IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT IT'S POINTING AT THREE DIFFERENT CELLS AND IT'S TELLING ME THAT IT'S BRAIN CELLS
BECAUSE THEY HELP YOU US THEY HELP US NOT GET SUNBURNED
BRAIN CELLS AND ALSO MUSCLE CELLS AND ALSO MUSCLES
IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ALL THE THINGS
I SEE THE SKIN CELLS IN THE GREEN BOX
IT'S SHOWING A BUTTERFLY AND BUTTERFLIES HAVE MULTIPLE CELLS ON THEM
THEY BOTH HAVE
HUMANS AND BUTTERFLIES BOTH HAVE THE SAME BODY PARTS AND THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME CELLS AS WELL
IT IS SHOWING THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND IT AND THAT INCLUDES THE ESOPHAGUS THE MOUTH
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN STUFF AND MAKING THEM INTO NUTRIENTS
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN FOOD AND TURNS THEM INTO NUTRIENTS
THE MOUTH CHEWS THE FOODS THAT CHEWS IT CHEWS THE FOOD INTO LITTLE TINY PIECES
IT'S A VERY GOOD PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE ESOPHAGUS I DON'T KNOW
THE INTESTINES BRING THE FOOD DOWN BRING THE BROKE DOWN FOOD FROM THE STOMACH UP
THE FOOD COMES
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHAPE AND SIZES
A PINNATE BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF SHAPED LIKE A FEATHER
FOR I THINK THAT THE VEINS ARE LEAF AND IT'S NORMAL AND IT'S
IT'S SHOWING THAT THE XYLEM IS GOING UP AND THAT THE PHLOEM IS GOING DOWN AND THAT IT'S LOW SAP
IT GOES DOWN AND UP THROUGH DIFFERENT SO IT HAS SEEDS IN IT AND THEN IT GOES UP AND DOWN
THE WATER IN THE BAG CAME FROM HUMIDITY
IT COMES FROM THE HUMIDITY FROM THE AIR
THAT IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
THE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM THAT YOU ARE SHOWING IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
LUNGS HEART AND VEINS
LUNGS AND HEART CAPILLARY
THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND HELPING YOU TO BREATHE
THEY AIR GOING IN AND OUT OF THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
ALL ABOUT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM HELPS US ALL BREATHE AND THE AIR GOES IN AND OUT THROUGH THE LUNGS
THE LUNGS BREATHES IN THE AIR AND THE C O TWO GOES OUT SO YOU BREATHE OUT
THE BRAIN
WE'RE TAKING THE C O TWO OUT AND PUTTING THE OXYGEN BACK ON
TO LET GO OF THE C O TWO
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND COMPOSERS ALSO ECOSYSTEMS FOOD WEBS AND CHAINS
I CAN THINK OF THAT ON A SUITCASE THE ZIPPER IS A SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF YOUR LUGGAGE FALLS OUT
IT HAS A SYSTEM FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE MANY SUBSYSTEMS THAT MAKE THIS ONE SYSTEM GO
A CAR IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SYSTEM IT RELATES TO MY SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE I WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE PARTS ARE MAKING THE PARTS MOVE
WITHOUT THESE THE CAR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE MAKING MAKING IT NOT A
IT HAS A BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS ADDING UP TO THIS ONE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE CAR
I SEE WHEELS I BELIEVE THE WHEELS MAKE THE CAR MOVE
THE HUMAN BODY IT HAS LOTS OF SYSTEMS TO MAKE THE HUMAN BODY WORK CORRECTLY
YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND ALSO SYSTEM
IT IS A FOOD WEB WE HAVE DECOMPOSERS COMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
YOU HAVE PRODUCERS COMPOSERS AND DECOMPOSERS
THEY ARE ABOUT THE THREE GROUPS ON THE FOOD CHAIN PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS
PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS
YOU PRODUCE THINGS YOU'RE BASICALLY THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN YOU DO NOT EAT ANYTHING
THE PLANT WILL NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT OTHER ANIMALS WILL EAT THE PLANT
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY ARE FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BUT THEY WILL NOT EAT ANYTHING WELL ACTUALLY THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
YOU CONSUME EVERYTHING YOU CONSUME PLANTS ANIMALS AND OTHER ANIMALS
THEY EAT PLANTS THEY EAT OTHER ANIMALS THEY EAT THINGS TO GIVE THEM THEIR ENERGY
YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR OWN FOOD YOU ARE FOOD FOR OTHERS AND OTHERS ARE FOOD FOR YOU
DECOMPOSERS COMPOSE CONSUMERS
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD ALSO WHEN A CONSUMER DIES THAT BACTERIA WILL SLOWLY EAT IT AND MAKE IT PART OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCE
I BELIEVE THIS IS A FOOD CHAIN
NO WE HAVE NOT LEARNED ABOUT UM WOULD YOU MIND SHOWING TELLING ME ABOUT THEM
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE HERBIVORES OMNIVORES AND WELL CARNIVORES BUT I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DETRIVORES
WILL ONLY EAT PLANTS OR YEAH YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS GREENS VEGETABLES OR AND YOU ALSO EAT CARNIVORES OR
THEY EAT GREENS LIKE THE HERBIVORES THEY EAT MEAT LIKE THE CARNIVORES
OMNIVORES BASICALLY EAT ALL FOOD I THINK THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS
YOU EAT DECAYING OR DECAYED PLANTS OR ANIMALS
DECAYING PLANTS OR ANIMALS
DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE IT EATS BOTH PLANTS AND AND
THE MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE THE MOOSE ONLY EATS PLANTS
HERBIVORES
IT IS A DECOMPOSER IT EATS DECAYING OR DECAYED PLANTS OR ANIMALS
DETRIVORES OR DECOMPOSER
EATEN BY THE WORMS WORMS CAN EAT HALF THEIR BODY WEIGHT IT IS ALSO DECOMPOSED THE WORMS ARE
WITHOUT DECOMPOSERS OR DETRIVORES OUR LANDS WOULD BE FILLED WITH DEAD ROTTEN GROSS PLANTS OR ANIMALS
IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT IS A CIRCLE OF LIFE A SYSTEM
WE BE WATCHING A SHORT CLIP OR VIDEO TODAY
I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU
WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTING WHAT EFFECTS WHAT IT'S BASICALLY A CAUSE AND EFFECT
WELL THE ANIMAL IS GETTING WATER WE NEED TO WATER OUR PLANTS OFTEN
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR SCIENCE
YEAST IS A LIVING ORGANISM ALL LIVING ORGANISMS NEED WATER AND FOOD IF YOU DON'T HAVE WATER AND FOOD YOU WILL DIE OF DEHYDRATION OR STARVATION
PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT TO GROW
YES IT DOES LIKE ALL PLANTS
PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE YES I WAS CORRECT THE FIRST TIME
I KNOW THAT PLANTS PRODUCE MORE OXYGEN THAN THEY NEED TO LIVE THAT IS VERY INTERESTING TO
I CAN SEE THE SUNLIGHT
I KNOW THAT PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SHOWING THAT PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT AM I CORRECT
YES THAT PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HAS IN CLASS DO YOU HAVE NAY IDEAS WHY
YES I DO BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GIVE IT A HAMBURGER
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A PROBLEM IF THEY NEEDED FOOD EVERYONE NEEDS FOOD WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU WILL DIE OF STARVATION IF YOU DO NOT GET ENOUGH FOOD
IT SHOWS A CAN OF JUICE I BELIEVE IT'S APPLE JUICE BUT IT COULD BE TOMATO JUICE
THEY DO NOT NEED WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IN THIS PICTURE
SOME PLANTS DO SOME PLANTS DON'T
PLANTS NEED FERTILIZER FERTILIZER IS A KEY
WELL THEY'VE MADE THEIR OWN FOOD SO I GUESS THAT THEY JUST MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEN IT'S OVER
YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD IT GOES THROUGH A CYCLE
THE SUN HAS GOTTEN A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT IT HASN'T GOTTEN ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS
THE PLANT DIDN'T GET AIR WITHOUT AIR THE PLANT CAN'T SURVIVE SUN AND WATER ARE GREAT THINGS TO GIVE THE PLANT BUT AIR PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE
WELL IT DOESN'T LOOK SUPER HEALTHY AND I CAN TELL IT WILL DIE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS OR MAYBE IN THE NEXT
IT DOESN'T LOOK AS HEALTHY AS WELL PLANTS WITH SUN SO CAN WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE NOW
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY AIR WITHOUT AIR THE PLANT CAN'T SURVIVE WATER AND SUN ARE GREAT THINGS BUT THE PLANT NEEDS AIR TOO
WELL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION I WAS WONDERING IF WE WOULD BE WATCHING A SHORT CLIP OR A VIDEO TODAY WILL WE
THE PLANT HAS GOTTEN EVERYTHING IT NEEDS AND LOOKS VERY HEALTHY
IT HAS GOTTEN THREE IMPORTANT THE THREE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUN
LAST THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED THIS PLANT DOES
IT'S HEALTHY THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
I GUESS THEY'RE JUST IMPORTANT TO ECOSYSTEMS AND THE BIOSPHERE
LETS START WITH PRODUCERS YOU CAN HEAR IT IN THEIR NAME PRODUCERS THEY PRODUCE THINGS WITHOUT PRODUCERS OUR FOOD WEB WOULD NOT GO
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM THE VASCULAR SYSTEMS AND HOW TO MAKE MAPLE SYRUP AND A LOT OF THINGS
WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND THERE'S POLLY PINNATE AND PARALLEL
A PALMATE LEAF A PALMATE LEAF
I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE THE THREE TYPES OF LEAF WE HAVE PENNATE PALMATE AND PARALLEL LEAVES
UM THE PHLOEM AND THE UM XYLEM
UM WATER AND AIR UM A CRUCIAL PART UM A CRUCIAL PART OF A PLANT'S LIFE IT NEEDS WATER AND AIR TO GROW
UM WELL I BET THE WATER COMES FROM THE CLOUDS CAUSE THE CLOUDS JUST LIKE BUILD UP WITH WATER
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT LIKE LEAVES AND STUFF AND LIKE WORMS
UM THESE ARE LIKE ANIMALS THEY'RE LIKE THE INSIDE OF AN ANIMAL THEY'RE LIKE IT'S ORGANS AND LIKE IT'S FOOD AFTER IT'S DIGESTED
UM WELL IT KIND OF HAS TO DO WITH LIKE
UM IT HAS SOME OF LIKE THE BODY PARTS OF A HUMAN
I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE MUSCLE CELLS
I NOTICE LIKE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE LIKE PURPLE AND LIKE MAGENTA ISH SPOTS ON THE MUSCLE CELLS
I CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE BRAIN CELLS
BASICALLY LIKE WHERE THE BRAIN CELLS ARE AND LIKE WHAT LIKE WHAT THEY DO AND STUFF LIKE WHAT THE BRAIN CELLS ARE
SKIN CELLS
THEY'RE THE CELLS ON YOUR SKIN SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THESE CELLS ON YOUR SKIN
UM THAT YEAST IS PRETTY DIFFERENT
UM I CAN SEE THAT THE YEAST CELLS ARE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
I SEE LIKE A BUNCH OF LEAFS
THAT KIND OF
IT'S A BUTTERFLY AND A BUTTERFLY IS AN ANIMAL
I THINK THAT BUTTERFLY'S ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE SIMPLER AND HUMAN'S ARE A BIT MORE COMPLEX
INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND WATER TO THE BLOOD STREAM AND COMPACT SOLID WASTE
UM IT FURTHER BREAKS DOWN AND IT LIKE GOES THROUGH MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ACTIONS
THEY DIGEST THE FOOD
THE MOUTH CONTAINS TEETH AND TEETH ARE WHAT CHEW UP YOUR FOOD TO MAKE IT IN LIKE THIS MUSHY BALL SO IT CAN GO DOWN TO THE ESOPHAGUS
THE ESOPHAGUS SENDS YOUR FOOD DOWN THROUGH A LONG TUBE SO IT'LL EVENTUALLY REACH THE STOMACH
ESOPHAGUS IT'S LIKE IT GOES THROUGH THIS TUBE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE LIKE REALLY FOOD THAT'S LIKE BEEN CHEWED UP
UM THE STOMACH IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE AFTER YOUR STOMACH IT'LL PROBABLY GO TO THE INTESTINE
HELP YOU DIGEST FOOD AFTER YOUR STOMACH AND THEN IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR RECTUM WHICH IS WHEN WHICH IS WHAT YOUR FOOD GOES THROUGH BEFORE YOU LIKE POOP IT OUT
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
I SEE THE THINGS INCLUDING THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
YOU BREATHE TO LIVE IF YOU DON'T BREATHE YOU CAN'T LIVE
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM THERE ARE LUNGS AND OTHER THINGS CAPILLARIES ALVEOLI
THE RESPIRATORY DIGESTS YOUR FOOD AND MAKES SURE IT GETS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE
WELL IF I WASN'T BREATHING RIGHT NOW I WOULDN'T BE LEAVING LIVING IF YOU WEREN'T BREATHING RIGHT NOW YOU WOULDN'T BE LIVING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BREATHE TO LIVE
THE LUNGS HELP YOU BREATHE WITHOUT LUNGS YOU WOULD NOT BE BREATHING
THE LUNGS ARE THE MAIN ORGANS FOR BREATHING IN HUMANS THE AND ALSO THE
AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE
WE BREATHE OUT CARBON DIOXIDE
I THINK THE LUNGS HELP US BREATHE THE LUNG WHEN YOU INHALE AIR YOUR LUNGS CAN TAKE A LOT BUT WHEN YOU EXHALE THAT'S AS MUCH AS YOUR LUNGS CAN EXHALE
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
THEY ALL HAVE TO USE ONE CERTAIN KIND OF STIMULI THEY CAN USE LIKE YOU KNOW
THEY ALL ARE VERY LIKE PRETTY AND THAT COULD ATTRACT A MATE
ANIMALS USE LIKE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE AS GOOD VISION AS US AND SO THEY USE THEIR SOUND TO DO A LOT OF THINGS
WELL ANIMALS HAVE TO ADAPT TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS I GUESS BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMAL ADAPTATIONS
THIS TORTOISE USES ITS SHELL TO SURVIVE SO IF A PREDATOR CAN SEE IT IT WON'T BE ABLE TO AND IN EXTREME HEAT THE TORTOISE CAN JUST GO INTO ITS SHELL
I THINK IT WOULD JUST MAKE LIFE A WHOLE LOT EASIER FOR A LOT OF REASONS
ITS VERY SMALL SO THAT MIGHT HELP IT
I CAN SEE THAT IT COULD PROBABLY ADAPT INTO CORAL
WELL I THINK THE COLORS AND PATTERNS IT MAKE IT REALLY EASY FOR IT TO BLEND IN WITH SEA LIFE BECAUSE SEA LIFE IS REALLY REALLY COLORFUL
THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE ITS WEBBED FEET HELP IT SWIM
BECAUSE IT CAN MOVE REALLY FAST WITH ITS WEBBED FEET
I THINK THE SECOND ADAPTATION THEIR TEETH WOULD HELP
THE WINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE BRIGHT COLORS TO WARN TO PREDATORS TO STAY AWAY YOU KNOW I'M POISONOUS
WELL I THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY BRIGHT COLORS USUALLY MEAN POISON FOR ANIMALS
THE RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE SOUND WARNS PREDATORS TO STAY AWAY
THE RATTLESNAKE IS RATTLING ITS TAIL TO MAKE THE PERSON SCARED
USING THEIR STIMULUS THEY WILL GET A REACTION
SEE THAT THE COYOTES BACKING AWAY FROM THE SKUNK I THINK THE SKUNK USED ITS ODOR TO SCARE AWAY THE COYOTE
ITS LIKE THE ODOR IT SQUIRT
A COYOTE WOULD PROBABLY BACK AWAY BECAUSE THAT SMELL IS SO HORRIBLE
WELL YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE ADAPTATION
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT OH IT'S JUST ABOUT ADAPTATION
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
HOW THEY HAVE ADAPTATIONS AND THEN YOU KNOW THEIR STIMULUS TO GET ATTRACT MATES AND OTHER THINGS
THE SKUNK USES ITS ODOR TO FRIGHTEN AWAY ANIMALS NO ONE LIKES THAT SMELL
I'M GUESS THAT YOU KNOW THOSE TEETH ARE SHARP SO THEY CAN CHEW UP ANIMALS AND I THINK THAT WOULD PLAY A BIG ROLE IN IT
I THINK ITS WINGS HELP IT WARN OFF PREDATORS YOU SEE THE BRIGHT COLORS WARN THE PREDATORS I'M POISON DON'T EAT ME
THE SNAKE IS USING ITS RATTLE WHICH IS SCARING AWAY THE PERSON THAT WILL MAKE THE PERSON LEAVE THE SNAKE ALONE
USING THE SNAKE'S STIMULUS THEN THAT WILL SCARE AWAY THE HUMAN USING THEIR BRAIN THE HUMAN CAN AUTOMATICALLY KNOW TO BACK AWAY
THE COYOTE WAS GOING TO EAT THE SKUNK BUT THE SKUNK USED ITS ODOR TO SCARE THE COYOTE AWAY
OH THE SKUNK USED ITS ODOR TO SCARE AWAY THE COYOTE
AN ADAPTATION THE SKUNK HAS IS THAT ODOR THAT IT SQUIRTS OUT IT SMELLS HORRIBLE AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE AROUND IT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEARNING SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY'RE MADE OF DIFFERENT PARTS
I THINK THAT COULD BE A PLUG TO SOMETHING LIKE IT COULD BE A ELECTRICAL CAR AND YOU HAVE TO PLUG IT IN MAYBE
BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT MAKE UP A CAR LIKE THE WHEELS OF THE STEERING WHEEL THE SEATS AND THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING
THE WHEELS CAUSE IT HELPS IT DRIVE AND THE GAS CAUSE IT HELPS IT RUN AND THE STEERING WHEEL TO CONTROL IT
I THINK THAT THERE'S THE WHEELS AND THE GAS PIPES
IT LIGHTS UP AND IT SHOWS YOU A DIFFERENT PART THAT CONNECTS TO IT
WHEN I HOVER OVER THE HEART THERE'S A BUNCH OF RED THINGS AND I THINK THAT'S THE BLOOD FLOWING THROUGH LIKE THE BLOOD VESSELS AND ALL THE BLOOD GOING THROUGH YOUR BODY
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS TO THE HUMAN BODY
UH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SUBSYSTEMS THERE ARE
MAYBE LIKE THE POPULATION OR THE HUMIDITY OR THE UM MAYBE LIKE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT IS YOUR NAME
GOOD HOW ARE YOU WHAT'S YOUR NAME
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
IT PRODUCE ON THE FOOD WEB BECAUSE THEY ARE PRODUCER CONSUMER AND
A PRODUCER'S A PLANT BECAUSE IT'S CAN BE GROWN AND IT'S PRODUCING SOMETHING FOR THE CONSUMER OR THE DECOMPOSER
WAS BEING A CONSUMER BECAUSE YOU THEY HAVE TO DECOMPOSE THEIR OWN FOOD
A DECOMPOSER IS ALL ABOUT THE LIKE BACTERIA AND FUNGUS AND IT DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING TO EAT FOR ENERGY THEY JUST DECOMPOSE THEIR OWN THINGS
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM FROM LIKE EATING THEIR OWN THING
IT'S IMPORTANT TO THEIR FOOD WEB BECAUSE THEY NEED TO EAT BUT THEY CAN'T PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THEY HAVE TO GET IT A DIFFERENT WAY
I THINK TO BE A CARNIVORE IT MEANS THAT YOU EAT MEAT
A OMNIVORE IS LIKE THEY ALSO EAT MEAT SO LIKE THE HUMAN'S EATING MEAT AND THE BEAR IS EATING MEAT
I THINK IT CONNECTS TO BEING OMNIVORE BECAUSE AH I'M HUNGRY
THINK WHAT A DECOMPOSER IS IT MEANS YOU DECOMPOSE THINGS
IT TELLS ME ABOUT DECOMPOSERS THAT LIKE IT'S THEIR OWN FOOD THAT THEY'RE NOT EATING
I THINK THEY'RE WHITE ANIMALS WHITE WHITE ANIMALS
IT MAKES THE BOX IT MAKES THE FOX EATING THE LITTLE WEASEL DUDE AND THE RABBIT
A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE
A MOOSE A PERSON THAT EATS MEAT
IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BECAUSE IT IS A DECOMPOSER
A DECOMPOSER
THEY EAT COMPOST AND THEY POOP IT UP
UM THE NEWSPAPER AND COMPOST STARTS WAY UP HIGH AND THEY START TO EAT IT AND POOP IT OUT AND IT GETS REAL LOW
IT STARTS TO SHRINK
I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
THESE ARE A BUNCH OF CELLS
THAT CELLS GOES THROUGH OUR OUR BODIES
THAT CELLS ARE IN OUR BODY
THE TOP PART OF THE BRAIN IS LIKE PURPLE AND IT HAS A BUNCH OF LIKE LIVING CELLS IN IT
IT'S LIKE PINK WITH LIKE THIS PURPLE LITTLE SPOTS AND MAYBE IT'S LIKE YOUR THIGHS OR YOUR LUNGS
THAT MUSCLE CELLS ARE PINK AND THAT THEY'RE LIKE CELLS THEY'RE LIKE REGULAR CELLS BUT THEY'RE MUSCLES SO THEY'RE MUSCLE CELLS
THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE PINK AND THAT THEY ARE MUSCLES AND THEY ARE CELLS
THE BRAIN HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LIKE MEMORY CELLS IN IT AND THEY'RE ALL CONNECTING TOGETHER TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN WORK
THAT THEY ARE BRAIN CELLS
THAT BRAIN CELLS HELP YOUR BRAIN WORK AND THEY ALL COME TOGETHER AND ALL OF THEM DO SOMETHING SPECIAL TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN WORK
THESE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS LIKE THESE ONES ARE BLUE CELLS IN A DIFFERENT PART OF YOUR BODY
THESE ARE SKIN CELLS THEY PROTECT YOUR SKIN
MEAT MEAT AND MORE MEAT
ANIMALS HAVE ALL THREE OF THE CELLS TOO
THE HUMAN IS SKIN CELLS AND THE YEAST IS JUST ALIVE ALIVE CELLS LIVING CELLS
THAT YEAST IS ALSO ALIVE
THE LEAF ISN'T LIVING AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY CELLS BUT THE HUMAN HAS MANY CELLS
THAT THE YEAST ONLY HAVE ONE CELL AND THE HUMANS HAVE MANY CELLS
THAT BOTH OF THEM HAVE MANY CELLS
BECAUSE THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS
THEY BOTH HAVE LIVING CELLS IN THEM
THAT THEY HAVE ABOUT THE SAME DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY WITH THE MOUTH GOING DOWN TO LIKE THE STOMACH AND IT'S DIGESTING IT
THAT YOU HAVE TO DIGEST FOOD
THEY DIGEST FOOD
YOU EAT THE FOOD AND IT GOES DOWN YOUR THROAT INTO THE MOUTH
THAT THAT'S HOW YOU EAT YOUR FOOD
THAT IT DIGESTS THE FOOD
THE ESOPHAGUS THE FOOD GOES DOWN THE THROAT AND THAT'S LIKE A BIG LONG TUBE THAT IT GOES DOWN AND THAT'S HOW IT GETS INTO YOUR STOMACH
THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU SWALLOW YOUR FOOD
IT DIGESTS FOOD
IT DIGESTS THE FOOD DOWN INTO YOUR LIKE BODY PART
THAT IT DIGESTS THE FOOD RIGHT THERE
THAT THEY PROCESS THE FOOD
THEY GO THROUGH YOUR BODY INTO YOUR LIKE DOWN AND THEN YOU PROCESS THE FOOD
THANKS FOR HELPING ME BYE
GOOD HOW ARE YOU WHAT IS YOUR NAME
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE VEINS IN THE HUMAN BODY
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A LEAF
WHAT I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN SCIENCE LATELY IS THE VEINS
I NOTICED THAT THESE LEAVES ALSO HAVE VEINS
THE LEAVES ARE IN DIFFERENT SHAPES AND FORMS
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LEAVES WITH VEINS LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES
SOME LEAVES ARE PARALLEL SOME ARE LIKE A HAND AND SOME ARE LIKE A FEATHER
SOME OF THE LEAVES HAVE PARALLEL VEINS OR SIDEWAYS VEINS
SOME OF THE LEAVES HAVE THAT ARE GOING UP AND TO THE SIDE BUT SOME ARE PARALLEL
MAYBE IT'S A LEAF THAT'S LIKE WITH THE HAND HOW THE LEAVES ALL THE VEINS ARE GOING OUT
THAT THIS LEAF HAS MANY DIFFERENT VEINS THAT ARE GOING MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
THIS LEAF REMINDS ME OF LIKE A FEATHER CAUSE IT GOES LIKE STRAIGHT UP
THAT THE LEAVES ARE GOING LIKE OUT AND BACK IN AND OUT AND BACK IN
I THINK SOME OF THE VEINS ARE FOR FOR IT TO LIVE
WELL THERE'S PALM VEINS PINNATE VEINS AND PARALLEL VEINS
THIS IS H TWO O XYLEM
BECAUSE THE LEAVES ARE CONNECTED TO THE PLANTS AND THAT'S HOW THEY ARE LIVING
THIS IS A SAP THE PHLOEM
IT'S GOING UP AND DOWN
I SEE THE ARROWS GOING BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN
THIS IS A LIKE A BRANCH WITH A BAG OVER IT AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF WATER IN THE AIR
I THINK THE WATER IN THE BAG CAME FROM YOUR HOUSE
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE AIR AND THE WATER
I THINK IT COMES FROM THE LEAVES
I THINK THE WATER JUST GETS STUCK IN BY THE LEAVES
I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION TOO GOOD BYE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE THE CELLS AND HOW ALL THE THE BODY PARTS HELP YOUR BODY WORK
THIS IS A PART OF THE HUMAN BODY
OUR LUNGS
THIS IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
THE NOSE THE MOUTH THE LUNGS THE BRONCHI THE DIAPHRAGM THE ALVEOLI AND THE TRACHEA
IT'S YOUR LUNGS BREATHING UP AND DOWN AND UP AND
IT HELPS YOUR LUNGS BREATHE
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
BREATHING ALL ABOUT HOW YOU LIVE AND THAT YOUR LUNGS ALL THE OXYGEN GETS THROUGH THEM
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU LIVE
THE LUNGS GO THROUGH ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY LIKE TUBES AND THEY THE BLOOD FLOWS THROUGH THEM
WELL YOUR AIR COMES FROM YOUR MOUTH OR NOSE AND IT GOES DOWN LIKE A LONG TUBE INTO YOUR LUNGS
WE GET AIR AND THEN IT COMES OUT
UM E
UH YOUR LUNGS NUMBER E LETTER E
YOU BREATHE THEM OUT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ADAPTATIONS
WHILE THERE IS SKUNK A TURTLE AND A SEA HORSE IN THERE IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ADAPTATIONS
BECAUSE THE SKUNK CAN
BECAUSE IT STINKS AND THAT CAN SCARE AWAY PREDATORS
THIS TURTLE LIVES IN A DRY ENVIRONMENT
BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY CAN CAMOUFLAGE IN WITH THE TREES AND THE BRANCHES AND THE DIRT
THIS HAWK FISH IT BLENDS IN WITH THE IT BLENDS IN WITH THE CORAL IN THE BACKGROUND OR WHATEVER
IT CAN IT CAN THEY BLEND IN AND THEY CAMOUFLAGE WITH THE BACKGROUND AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE IN
BECAUSE THEY CAN SCARE AWAY THE PREDATORS
NUMBER TWO HELPS THE DUCKS SWIM BECAUSE ITS FEET CAN PADDLE IT AND MAKE IT SWIM FASTER
I THINK NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THEIR SHARP TEETH THAT CAN BITE INTO THE PREDATOR
BECAUSE IF THEY SEE SOMETHING YUMMY IN THEIR TUMMY THEY GET TO GO SNATCH IT UP AND CLAW IT AND BITE IT WITH THEIR TEETH
I THINK I THINK NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE THEIR ANTENNAS THAT THEY CAN POKE THEM WITH
BECAUSE THE THE BRIGHT PATTERN CAN SCARE THE PREDATOR AWAY AND IT WON'T EAT IT
I JUST TOLD YOU THE SNAKE RATTLES ITS TAIL AND IT SCARES THE PERSON AWAY
I JUST TOLD YOU BARNEY
I JUST TOLD YOU LISTEN
IT HAS TO DO STIMULATION BECAUSE THE SKUNK WORKS UP ITS TAIL AND SPRAYS IT
BECAUSE THE SKUNK CAN RAISE UP ITS TAIL AND IT'LL POISON
THE COYOTE CAN CAN COME AND EAT THE SKUNK
I JUST TOLD YOU IT HAS TO DO ON HUMANS AND ANIMALS REACT TO STUFF
BECAUSE LIKE THE ANIMAL IF IT SEES SOMETHING IN THE AIR IT'S GOING TO JUMP AND THE BIRD IS GOING TO FLY AWAY
FOR A REFLEX LIKE YOU PULL YOUR HAND AWAY OR YOU MOVE BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF IT OR SOMETHING THAT'S AN EXAMPLE
THEY'RE REACTING AND FLYING AWAY FROM SOMETHING LIKE A PREDATOR MAYBE
I THINK IT'S INSTINCTUAL BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN IT BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW WHEN TO PULL YOUR HAND
THIS IS A NATURAL ONE BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING STUCK IN HER KNEE THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE IT HURTS AND SO SHE IS IT PROBABLY REALLY LIKE LIKE HURT THE DOCTOR
NO I DON'T BECAUSE YOU'RE BORN WITH IT LIKE IN THE OTHER ONES
THIS ONE YOU LEARN CAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE YOUR OWN NAME
THIS IS LEARNED BECAUSE THE TURTLES ARE IN THE SHELL AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WALKING TO THE THE SHORE
IN THIS ONE A CAT JUST FELL FROM THE TREE
IT'S INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IF A CAT FALLS FROM SOMEWHERE THEY WANT TO SAVE THEMSELVES SO THEY PUT ALL FOUR LEGS DOWN THEY DON'T JUST FALL
GOOD
UM I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE ANIMALS AND STUFF
YES THESE ARE LIKE THE STUFF AND UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL OF THESE SO
MAKING IT MOVE AND STUFF WHILE YOU TURN ON THE POWER IN THE ENGINE
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS LIKE BODIES TO LIKE UM SO WE CAN LEARN WHAT IS INSIDE OUR BODIES AND STUFF
I CLICKED THE BOTTOM ONE AND IT LOOK AND IT SHOWS ME WHAT IS IN IT AND A PART OF IT'S
IT'S ALL THE BLOOD IT LOOKS LIKE IN OUR BODIES AND LIKE ALL THE LITTLE VEINS THAT ARE RED KINDA
TELLS ME THAT SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S IN IT AND PART OF IT AND STUFF
I THINK LIKE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER AND UM THEY MAKE THE EARTH LIKE REALLY GOOD SO
IT LOOK LIKE A BIG LIKE MOUNTAIN AND THEN IT GOES DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN INTO THE WATER
SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
UM NICE TO MEET YOU TOO
LIKE BEEN I'VE BEEN LEARNING
IT'S LIKE THE FOOD ANIMALS CHEMICALS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AIR WATER ALL THAT STUFF
LIKE ANIMALS FOOD PLANTS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
LIKE THERE'S THIS THING THAT WE DID LIKE HYDROSPHERE ATMOSPHERE GEOSPHERE ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF SO
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
UM LIKE CAN YOU SAY THAT
CAN
I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT YEAH YEAH SO
LIKE ANIMALS HUMANS THE EARTH
NOT REALLY
THEY DON'T AND THEY DO BECAUSE
WELL THE WIND CAN ACTUALLY BLOW THE LEAVES OFF IF IT'S LIKE REALLY REALLY STRONG
THE AIR CAN LET IT FEEL GOOD AND STUFF SO
CHEESEBURGER
FRENCH FRIES LIKE LETTUCE AND THE BREAD PROBABLY I REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT YEAH
IT CAN BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WON'T GROW AND IT WILL PROBABLY EVEN SHRINK
CAN NOT HELP CAUSE IT'S OIL AND IT'S BAD FOR YOU
AND DON'T REALLY KNOW WAIT WHAT I FORGOT TO
HI
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE HYDROSPHERE BIOSPHERE GEOSPHERE AND ATMOSPHERE ALL FOUR SYSTEMS
THE PRODUCERS ARE THE PINE CONE AND THE TREES AND THE GRASS BECAUSE THEY ALL MAKE THEIR FOOD FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS
ANIMALS GET THEIR FOOD BY EATING EACH OTHER OR EATING PRODUCERS
THE DECOMPOSERS ARE THE MUSHROOMS AND THE BACTERIA IN THIS PICTURE
ALMOST ALL PLANTS EXCEPT FOR THE VENUS FLY TRAPS ARE PRODUCERS
A THING A PRODUCE ORGANISM THAT HAS TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO STAY ALIVE IS A CONSUMER
HERBIVORES MEANS YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS NOTHING ELSE
HERBIVORES ONLY EAT PRODUCERS THEY ARE THE FIRST LEVEL CONSUMERS
A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS LITTLE GRASS OUT OF THE LAKES AND IT EATS TREES TOO
THAT MAKES HIM FIRST LEVEL CONSUMER
THAT MEANS A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE
BECAUSE THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER AND THAT'S WHAT DECOMPOSERS DO
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT HOW UH PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND THEIR NUTRITION
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE YEAST IS UHM BEING BREAKING ITS DORMANCY WITH THE SUGAR FROM THE GRAHAM CRACKER
YEAST IS A FUNGI THAT UHM IS USED IN BREAD
YES THIS PLANT NEEDS WATER TO SURVIVE
THIS IS UHM LOOKS LIKE WIND AND IT I DON'T THINK THAT PLANTS NEED WIND TO
PLANTS NEED A PLACE TO LIVE SO THEY CAN'T JUST BE FLOATING IN AIR IN THE OCEAN THEY NEED A SUITABLE PLACE TO LIVE
WILTED IS THE NAME SAME THING FOR LIKE DRIED UP NO WATER MEANS IT'S PRETTY WILTED
IT AHS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW IT HAS WATER CARBON DIOXIDE AND SUNLIGHT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DO STUFF
IT HAS ALL THE STUFF IT NEEDS TO DO ITS BASIC FUNCTIONS SUNLIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER
BEEN STUDYING A LOT ABOUT THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
LITTLE YEAST CELLS YEP THAT'S IT WELL YOU EAT LITTLE YEAST CELLS WHEN THEY'RE ALL COOKED UP
YEAST IS ONE CELLED ORGANISMS THAT MAKE UP BREAD AND STUFF
I NOTICE THAT THEY EACH HAVE CELLS
I NOTICE THAT THE HUMAN AND YEAST CELLS ARE KIND OF ALMOST THE SAME
I SEE MUSCLE CELLS OF THE LEG THESE MUSCLE CELLS CONTRACT TO HELP YOU WALK RUN AND MOVE
I KNOW THAT MUSCLE CELLS CONTRAST AND EXPAND TO HELP YOU MOVE
BRAIN CELLS HELP YOU THINK WITHOUT THEM YOU'D YOU WOULD DIE YEAH
KEEP YOU FROM BEING CUT AND LIKE BUT SOMETIMES THEY DO GET THAT AND THEN WHITE CELLS COME AND REPAIR IT BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF A BUTTERFLY
THE BUTTERFLY BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EAT AND PROCESS THE FOOD
THIS IS A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF A BUTTERFLY AND A HUMAN THE THEY ALMOST ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXCEPT SMALLER FOR THE BUTTERFLY AND LARGER FOR THE HUMAN
BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SO WE CAN EACH HAVE THEY CAN EACH EAT AND DISPOSE OF THE WASTE
SYSTEM IS ABOUT BREAKING DOWN FOODS AND ALLOWING THE BODY TO PROCESS THEM INTO ENERGY
UHM WAS PUSHES DOWN PUSHES DOWN THE FOOD INTO THE STOMACH
ESOPHAGUS DOES IS MOVES THE FOOD DOWN THE UHM INTO THE STOMACH SO IT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN MORE
BREAKS DOWN THE FOOD EVEN MORE NUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH SO IT HAS TO MOVE ONTO THE INTESTINES
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND THEIR VEINS AND BOTH THEIR VASCULAR BUNDLES
PARALLEL BECAUSE THE VEINS ARE RUNNING PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER
MAINLY BECAUSE IT HAS ONE VEIN CENTERED THING AND IT HAS OTHER LEAVES SPREADING LIKE OTHER VEINS SPREADING OUT
THIS IS THE PALMATE LEAF
LEAF THIS IS A PENNATE LEAF
THIS IS WHAT I JUST SENT AND THAT'S A DIAGRAPH THIS IS WHAT ALL I JUST SEND EXCEPT LABELLED
IT IS A GIVE OUT THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND BRING IN OXYGEN
THE AIR COMES IN THE BODY FROM THE NOSE AND THE MOUTH
IN A DIAPHRAGM TO CONTRAST YOUR LUNGS
THESE ARE THE LITTLE TUBES THAT CARRY THE AIR AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF THE BODY
THE LETTER F REPRESENTS IT
IT IS LETTER H
SO THE GUY HERE IS REALLY THAT SOUND IS LIKE AND HE'S REALLY LIKE CALM AND ALL AND LIKE OH WELL OH WHAT WAS THAT
THE REACTION IS THE SLAPPING ON THE HAND
THE STIMULUS WAS THE PIECE THAT GRAPE JUICE FALLEN OVER AND YEAH THEN A GUY JUMPING UP REAL FAST WAS THE RESPONSE
SO THE MAIN POINTS WAS CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONDS AND STIMULUS
DEFENDING ITS TERRITORY IS A NATURAL BEHAVIOR SO AND THE WOLF KNOWS STAY AWAY FROM THAT SKUNK HE'S GOING TO MAKE A HORRIBLE SMELL
ITS ADAPTATIONS IS THE CAMOUFLAGE ON IT'S SHELL TO HIDE FROM PREDATORS
SHARP TEETH HELP THEM REMOVE FLESH TO SWALLOW THE MEAT
PROBABLY THE COLORFUL WINGS BECAUSE THE PREDATORS MIGHT THINK OH NO IT MIGHT BE POISONOUS BECAUSE OF THEIR BRIGHT COLORFUL PATTERN
TURTLES ARE JUST CRAWLING OUT BECAUSE IT'S AN INSTINCTUAL BEHAVIOUR THEY KNOW JUST IT
FALLING OUT OFF THE TREE AND YOU KNOW IT'S A PRETTY STEEP DOWN SO IT JUST BREAK IT'S FACE
I HAVE BEEN DOING LIVING SYSTEMS AND DOING RED WORMS
THEY'RE THEY ARE SHOWING ME HOW THE FOOD WEB IN THIS ENVIRONMENT HAPPENS
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE SYSTEMS AND RED WORMS HOW THEY LIKE GROW AND EAT
THEY EAT OTHER CONSUMERS
BUNNY SNAKE AND THE BUGS
THE DECOMPOSERS BREAK DOWN FOOD
PRODUCERS MAYBE
THE BIRDS
A MAYBE A CONSUMER MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S MISSING
YOU'RE YOU'RE SHOWING ME THE HERBIVORES THE CARNIVORES THE OMNIVORES AND THE DETRIVORES
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
A HERBIVORE EATS MEAT AND NOT PLANTS
HERBIVORE OR NO AN OMNIVORE
PLEASE REPEAT
THEY EAT MEAT
CARNIVORE CARNIVORE CARNIVORE OH
IT EATS GRASS AND MEAT
IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
UHM I'M DOING FINE
YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE THE LIKE TOY
OH THE WATER IS DISSOLVING THE ANIMAL COOKIE
IT'S YOU'RE GOING TO GROW YEAST
UHM THEY ARE MOLECULES THAT ARE CELLS THAT ARE INSIDE THE YEAST
LIKE THE EXACT PICTURE OF OUR PLANTS
HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW
THE PLANT IS GETTING OXYGEN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
THEY GET SUGAR FROM UNDERGROUND
IT'S IT DIDN'T LIKE GET ENOUGH SUN SO THERE'S NO HEAT ON IT AND IT CAN'T GROW
HORRIBLE IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO SUN OR AIR
UHM IT CAN'T LIKE REALLY
IT'S PERFECT
BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE THREE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS TO LIVE
I AM DOING FINE
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
I SEE LIKE MOLECULES MAYBE
I HAVE BEEN GROWING
THE HUMAN CELLS HAVE BROADENED THEM
THERE IS A MUSCLES CELLS AND IT'S CELLS
IT HOLDS YOUR MUSCLES
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT ARE YOU
WAIT WHAT CELLS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN MARNIE
THAT MOSTLY EVERYTHING HAS CELLS AND I GOT YOU KNOW
THE PURSUING OF BEE THIS
THE ANIMAL HAS CELLS IN ITS BRAINS MUSCLES AND
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IT'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE CYCLE OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
WELL THE MOUTH BRINGS DOWN THE FOOD
IT BRINGS YOUR FOOD INTO YOUR MOUTH I DON'T KNOW
BINGS FOOD INTO YOUR LUNGEE CORD THING YOU
IT'S LIKE WHERE YOUR ANUS
I'M DOING FINE HOW ABOUT YOU
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE THREE DIFFERENT LEAVES
IT LOOKS LIKE A AH
GIVES THE WATER AND FOOD AND NUTRIENTS
KEEPS KEEPS THE VEINS WORKING
THERE IS WATER GOING INTO THE LEAVES
BECAUSE THEY CAN MOVE I THINK I'M NOT VERY SURE
THE EYES THE HEART AND THE ORGANS
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WELL THEY LIKE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM I THINK
I SEE WATER HOUSES TREES CORAL AND I THINK THAT'S A MOUNTAIN
I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE WATER FISH LIKE LIVING THINGS
I THINK THEY'RE ALL ABOUT JUST JUST EATING FOOD I GUESS I I DON'T KNOW
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND DECOMPOSERS COMPOSERS AND PRODUCERS
I CAN NOT HEAR YOU RIGHT NOW
I THINK PINE CONE GRASS THE MUSHROOM AND THE BACTERIA
WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I CAN'T HEAR YOU YOU'RE MAKING ME SO BAD RIGHT NOW
THE OWL A BIRD THE BEETLE A LIZARD THE BUNNY AND THE SNAKE
I THINK IT'S A DECOMPOSER BUT I'M NOT VERY SURE
THEY BOTH EAT THEY BOTH EAT LIKE LEAVES
CARNIVORES EAT OTHER CARNIVORE
IT'S A CONSUMER BECAUSE YOU EAT THEY EAT OTHER ANIMALS
IT TELLS ME THAT WORMS AND MUSHROOMS EAT DIFFERENT THINGS AND CATERPILLARS ROLY POLY AND BEETLES
THEY'RE A CONSUMER BECAUSE BACTERIA AND FUNGI THEY DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING TO ANIMALS AND FOODS
THAT MEANS THAT THEY THEY ARE I DON'T KNOW
THAT THEY MAKE SOIL
A LIVING ORGANISM
THING THAT MAKES THEM REALLY FAT
THEY MAKE SOIL AND HELP PLANTS GROW
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE OUTSIDE THERE MIGHT BE AN EASIER WAY FOR THEM TO LIKE HIDE OF BIRDS AND STUFF
IT IT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY EAT PAPER AND OTHER STUFF SO I THINK THAT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT
WELL IT JUST NEEDS WATER OXYGEN CARBON DIOXIDE SUNLIGHT AND YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT TO SURVIVE
MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BECAUSE UHM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED THE SUGAR LIKE THE SUGAR LEAVES THE STUFF IN THE PLANT TO FOR IT TO GROW
IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO GROW BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNLIGHT IT JUST FLOPS
THERE'S NO AIR SO THAT JUST MAKES IT WORSE IT'S PROBABLY JUST GOING TO DIE RIGHT AWAY
MADE IT ALL
WELL IT HAS EVERYTHING IT HAS A WATER THE AIR THE SUNLIGHT AND EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW AND LOOK
BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE SUNLIGHT IT NEED ALL THE AIR IT NEEDS AND ALL THE WATER IT NEEDS
UH NOT SURE
I'M GOOD
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT
UHM THAT IT'S LIVING AND HUMANS ARE LIVING SO THEY'RE BOTH LIVING
I NOTICE MUSCLE OR WHATEVER THAT THOSE LITTLE THINGS ARE THAT ARE IN THE LIKE LEG
IT'S SHOWING US LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT WORKS YEAH STUFF LIKE THAT
I SEE SKIN CELLS
THEY'RE BOTH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM I THINK
I THINK IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW THE REST OF YOUR BODY'S LIKE THE LITTLE INTESTINES AND THE BIG INTESTINES AND IT GOES THROUGH AND IT BECOMES WASTE
NOTHING I DON'T KNOW
THE STOMACH IT HOLDS LIKE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT GOES DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE WELL IT'S ALL OF THE FOOD THAT YOU CHEW DOWN
STOMACH FURTHER BREAKS DOWN FOOD THROUGH MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL
IT GOES THROUGH LIKE THE SMALL INTESTINE AND IT GOES TO THROUGH TO THE BIG INTESTINES TO COME INTO THE WASTE AND THEN IT GOES OUT
INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND WATER INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND COMPACT SOLID WASTE
I AM GOOD
I HAVE NO CLUE
IT EASIER IT NEEDS TO COMES IN FROM YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH
I THINK THAT WILL BE THE LUNGS I AM NOT SURE I AM JUST TAKE IT LOT GUESS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'D BE THE LUNGS
I AM I I THINK THIS I DON'T KNOW
EITHER FROM THE MOUTH OR THE NOSE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE EEE THROAT
HMM I DON'T KNOW
I AM GOOD I KNOW WHY I GUESS SO
IT PROTECTS IT PROTECTS THEM FROM LIKE PEOPLE LIKE ANIMALS THAT ARE TRYING TO EITHER EAT THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S LOOKING FOR PREY
IT'S HIS ADAPTATION
HIS SHELL
THE WINGS HELP HIM FLY THAT'S ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS AND HIS YEAH
SKUNK KNOW MUCH HE SPRAY THAT HE SPRAYS ON STUFF SO THAT'S I THINK THIS ONE
IT DEPENDS BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT JUST AN INSTINCTIVE BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT
AND OH WHAT KNOW AH
NOT LEARNED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST TAUGHT YOU'RE JUST NOT TAUGHT LIKE YOU'RE JUST OH IT'S TIME TO COME OUT NOW THEY THEY JUST COME OUT WHENEVER THEY WANT TO COME OUT
IT'S A D CELL THE POWER CORDS AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB
WELL THE DIRECTION OF ENERGY FLOWS TO THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL
I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN POWERING MOTORS WITH BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANELS AND CREATING CIRCUITS
TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT
WELL THE SWITCH AND THE NAIL ALLOWS ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT TO REACH THE OTHER WIRE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR SO THAT
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL THEY CAN THERE IS A SOURCE OF
BYE BYE SEE YOU LATER ADIOS AMIGOS
I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN CREATING SERIES CIRCUIT AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND DISCOVERING WHAT THEY DO WHEN YOU LIGHT TO BULB
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
WELL IN THIS THERE IS TWO D CELL BATTERIES AND THEY'RE BOTH PARALLEL CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS AND DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE WHAT ATTRACTS SOME RIPPLES AND WHAT DOESN'T CONNECT AT ALL
FOR MAGNET AND THEN NAIL STICK BECAUSE IT'S IRON
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL AND THE MAGNET FOR TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER
IRON OR STEEL HAS TO BE IN THE MAGNET
THE STEEL SCREW IS STICKING AND THE ALUMINIUM SCREW IS NOT
THE GREY ROCK OR THE BLACK ROCK
IT CONNECTS BECAUSE IT HAS TRACES OF IRON OR STEEL
BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF METAL
IT MAY HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ON THE MAGNETS
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHEN A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE TO OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
WELL THE MAGNET IS CONNECTING TO THE STEEL NAIL WHICH IS TURNING THE STEEL NAIL INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET WHICH IS WHY THE PAPER CLIP IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL
THE MAGNET IS CONNECTED TO THE STEEL NAIL SO THE STEEL NAIL IS TEMPORARY MAGNET WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE PAPER CLIP
THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS BEING TAKEN OFF THE STEEL NAIL
BECAUSE WHEN THE PERMANENT MAGNET GETS TAKE IT OFF THE STEEL NAIL THE STEEL NAIL ISN'T A MAGNET ANYMORE SO IT CAN ATTRACT TO THE PAPER CLIP
WHEN A PERMANENT MAGNET TOUCHES A STEEL NAIL STEEL NAIL BECOMES THE TEMPORARY MAGNET
SO MAGNETISM IS RUNNING FROM THE PERMANENT MAGNET TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THEN THE STEEL NAIL ATTRACTS TO THE PAPER CLIP
THEY'RE CONNECTING TROUGH THE MAGNETIC FIELD
IT MAKES A DISTANCE GROW WHEN THE FORCE BECOMES WEAKER
WITH THE POSITION OF THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING THE METAL SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN RUN
THE ELECTRO MAGNET TURNS OFF
WELL IT MEANS THAT IT'S TEMPORARY AND IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER
WELL BECAUSE A TEMPORARY MAGNET MEANS IT'S NOT PERMANENT SO IT DOESN'T STAY THERE FOREVER
THERE NEEDS TO BE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENERGY AND THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
I I AM LEARNING ABOUT
D CELL BATTERY TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
BATTERIES ARE THINGS WITH STORED ENERGY AND THERE IS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE
A D CELL IS IMPORTANT WHEN LIGHTING A BULB BECAUSE IT HAS STORED ENERGY THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
IT PROBABLY SAYS SOURCE BECAUSE IT IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY IT STORES ENERGY IN IT
THEY CONNECT THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB SO IT CAN FORM A CIRCUIT TO TO MAKE LIGHT
THINK THE WIRES I THINK THE WIRES ARE A PATHWAY BECAUSE THEY LEAD FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE A CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
WIRES CARRY ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY FROM BATTERY TO LIGHT BULB
LIGHT BULBS ARE THE THING THAT SHOW WHAT THE ENERGY IS DOING THEY LIGHT UP
THEY ARE THE RESULTS OF THE ENERGY
IT MEANS THAT WE CAN LIKE SEE STUFF LIKE SEE THE THINGS AROUND US WHEN A LIGHT BULB SHINES
THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FROM POSITIVE SIDE THROUGH THE BATTERY AND IS GOING OUT THE NEGATIVE
ONE SIDE IS THE POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE PLUS SIGN AND THE OTHER IS THE NEGATIVE SIGN THE MINUS SIGN
THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES
IT GOES TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE
THE BLUE DOTS SWITCHED THE DIRECTION TO GO TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE
THE TERMINAL ONE WIRE IS ON THE LIGHT BULB CASING AND THE TERMINAL OF THE OTHER WIRE IS ON THE LIGHT BULB BASE
THE LIGHT WOULDN'T SHINE
IF YOU SWITCH ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB CASING IT THE LIGHT SHINES AGAIN
CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
YOU CAN USE SOME OF THEM IN A CIRCUIT
THE CIRCUIT ONLY CLOSES WITH METAL OBJECT
THE METAL THINGS WORK AND THEY MAKE THE MOTOR RUN AND THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE METAL IN THE DON'T WORK
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN THAT WORKS TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
IT IS I DON'T KNOW
THE ONES THAT ARE MADE OUT OF METAL MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
WE HAVE BEEN USING OBJECTS TO MAKE IT CLOSED CIRCUIT
ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES LIGHT AND HEAT
CANDLE
THE CANDLE MOUNTS AND WAX TRIPS DOWN
YOU MAY HEAR SIZZLING OR A LITTLE CRACKLING FROM THE FLAME
IT IS GIVING OFF LIGHT AND IT IS HOT
A PERSON IS DRUMMING AND THEIR HANDS ARE MOVING AND HITTING A DRUM AND THE DRUM IS GIVING OFF NOISE
THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS GIVING OFF ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING AROUND
THE DRUM VIBRATES AND IT GIVES OFF NOISE OR SOUND
FROM THE APPLE
CANDLE APPLES CABINET WOOD AND A RED CONTAINER
IT GETS CLOUDY
THERE WILL BE LESS POLLUTION AND LESS CLOUDY AIR
THERE WON'T BE CLOUDY AIR
THEY PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
THEY BOTH GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN
THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
THEY HURT THE ENVIRONMENT
THEY ARE NOT RENEWABLE
THEY WOULD CAUSE POLLUTION
COAL AND GASOLINE
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP
SERIES CIRCUITS HAVE DIMMER LIGHT LIKE THE LIGHT IS DIMMER THAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
THE LIGHT BECOMES BRIGHTER
IT GOES I DON'T KNOW
IT GOES IN THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT'S GOING AND IN THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT'S GOING IN THE POSITIVE SIDE IN THE BATTERY AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
THERE IS THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
THE LIGHT BULBS IS SHINING THE WHOLE TIME
THEY ARE SHARING ONE CIRCUIT
THERE IS TWO BATTERIES
THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNET
THEY STICK TO SUPERCONDUCTORS OTHER MAGNETS AND IRON AND STEEL
MAGNETS STICKING TO A REFRIGERATOR
BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS METAL ON IT
THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO A MAGNET
WOOD ALUMINIUM COPPER STRAW AND SPONGE
THE MAGNET AND THEN NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE ITS STEEL AND A MAGNET BUT IT DOES NOT STICK TO THE WOODEN BLOCK
STEEL IRON SUPERCONDUCTORS AND OTHER MAGNETS STICK TO MAGNET
THE NAIL IS MADE OF STEEL AND THE WOODEN BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE STEEL IRON SUPERCONDUCTORS OR OTHER MAGNETS IN IT
MAGNET STICK TO STEEL AND IRON
ONE OF THEM IS MADE OF ALUMINIUM AND ONE OF THEM IS MADE OF STEEL
ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS
THE THINGS THAT HAVE IRON AND STEEL IN THEM ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
IRON OR STEEL
IT STICK TO IRON AND STEEL AND ALUMINIUM AND STUFF LIKE THAT DON'T STICK
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT POLES AND MAGNETS
THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE OF A BAR MAGNET
THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER
ONE MAGNET IS REPELLING THE OTHER
SOME OF THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING AND SOME OF THEM ARE REPELLING
THE BOTH OF THEM
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH ARE TOGETHER
THIS IS A GIRL FOLLOWING A COMPASS AND THE COMPRESS IS DIRECTING HER NORTH
THE NORTH PART OF THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TOWARD THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH IS MAGNETIZED TOWARD THE SOUTH POLE
MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING THE PAPERCLIP
THE MAGNET IS TRYING TO MAGNETISE THE PAPERCLIP
THE MAGNETIC FIELD DOESN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE STEEL WASHERS
IT ADDS STEEL WASHERS
I CAN ADD AND TAKE AWAY THE SPACERS
YOU PUT THEM BETWEEN THE MAGNETS TO SEE HOW STRONG THE MAGNET FIELD IS
IT PUTS THE MAGNETS FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY
IT INCREASES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
MAKES IT'S LESS
THE STRONGER IS THE LESS SPACERS
PUT MORE SPACERS IN
INCREASES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY CURRENTS AND CIRCUITS
THIS IS A D CELL BATTERY UM THIS IS A LIGHT BULB AND THESE ARE WIRES
THESE UM THEY HAVE THE POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE YOU CAN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN IT WILL LIGHT
THE UM THE WHY THE D CELL SAYS SOURCE IS BECAUSE UH D CELL BATTERY IS A UM SOURCE
A D CELL PROVIDES
THE POINT OF THE D CELL IS THAT THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BOTH UM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT WILL NOT IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND IT'LL JUST
IT HELPS THE UM IT
I LIKE PIE UM THE REASON THEY ARE LIKE
ELECTRIC CURRENTS TRAVEL IN WIRES
THEY CARRY ELECTRIC CURRENTS AROUND THE CIRCUIT
BULBS THEY HELP LIGHT THE THING UP
LIGHT BULB UM IT'S CALLED A RECEIVER BECAUSE IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRIC CURRENTS FROM THE BATTERY FROM THE STORED ENERGY SO IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP
I DON'T KNOW
THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS THE SIDE THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN
THE END OF THE D CELL IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE ITS FLOW
IT UM FLOWS TOWARDS THE CASING OF THE LIGHT BULB WHICH HELPS LIGHT THE BULB
IT JUST REVERSES THE
IT'S THAT COMPONENTS UM
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY ELECTRICAL CURRENT UH CIRCUIT ANY CIRCUIT
I NOTICE THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY
I DON'T KNOW
I I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT YOU YOU'RE CREEPY
UH WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS ELECTRICAL CURRENTS TERMINALS YEAH
UH D CELL WIRE IS CONNECTING FROM THE
I DON'T KNOW
THE MOTOR IF THE MOTOR IS MOVING THEN I THINK THE MOTOR IS ON AND IT WILL SPIN
THINK THAT IT IS THE UM D CELL BATTERY AND IT IS CONNECTING TO THE UM MOTOR SO THAT THE MOTOR CAN RUN
LEVER IS PULLED DOWN SO THAT THE CIRCUIT CAN RUN THROUGH THE LEVER
IT IS THAT THE LEVER IS PULLED DOWN
I NOTICED THAT THE I NOTICED THAT THE WIRES ARE I MEAN THE WIRES THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS MOVING THROUGH
IT'S INSIDE UH IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE WIRE IT IS NOT PULLED OUT
IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE UM
THEY HELP USE SOLAR INSTEAD OF BATTERY STORED ENERGY IT HELPS USE UM THE SOLAR TO HELP MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR SOMETHING RUN
THE MOTOR IS UH I MEAN THE UM SOLAR FROM THE SUN IS GOING DOWN ONTO THE SOLAR PANEL WHICH IS MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
IT HAS TO HAVE ENERGY SOURCE SUCH AS A SOLAR PANEL OR A BATTERY
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SOLAR UM IS ALSO A SOURCE OF ENERGY ENERGY SOURCE
THE FLAG ACTUALLY STOPS WHEN THE SUNS NOT RISING
WILL RUN AND IF THE SUN IT NOT OUT THEN IT WILL STOP
IT IS IT RUNS
HELPS MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND THE FLAG WILL TURN
OH MY GOD
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR PANELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
THEY ARE ALL MADE OF SOMETHING METAL
THEY HELPS THE WHOLE THING HELPS THE CIRCUIT RUN PROPERLY
THE WOODEN STICK IS NOT ALLOWED
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A METAL AND IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT CAN HAVE ELECTRICITY CAN'T RUN THROUGH IT
IT COMPLETELY STOPS BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T A CONDUCTOR AND IT IS NOT AN INSULATOR EITHER
IT WILL RUN BECAUSE THEY HAS SOMETHING IN IT
THERE ARE INSULATORS SUCH
CONDUCTORS ARE THING THAT WE CAN THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THEM
THEY ARE ALL ARE METAL THE BRASS
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ELECTRICITY
THEY REALLY
IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MAKING THE WAX FALLING DOWN AND IT IS MELTING LIKE IT IS WOOD
I OBSERVED THAT THE WAX IS MELTING AND IT IS YEAH CONSTANTLY MOVING DOWN BECAUSE OF ALL THE HEAT
IT FELT WARM AND IT FELT VERY THAT WAS LIKE ON FIRE
THIS IS A MELTING THE WAX IN THE WAX IS COMING DOWN AND SLOWLY
THE GIRL IS WALKING WHILE EATING APPLE AND APPLE IS PRODUCING HER WITH ENERGY THAT SHE CAN MOVE
GASOLINE AND COAL ARE FOSSIL FUELS SO THEY WILL MAKE POLLUTION BUT WINDMILLS ARE BASICALLY
THE AIR BECOMES VERY SMELLY AND STINKY AND IT BECOMES KIND OF HARD TO BREATH
THE RESULT WOULD BE BETTER INSTEAD OF WASTING AND POLLUTING THE THINGS THEY WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT IN A NON-FOSSIL FUEL IN A GOOD WAY
WON'T BE ANY CONTACT UNLESS IF IT'S FOR THE SUN IT IS JUST THE BETTER FOSSIL FUEL WHAT'S NOT REALLY FOSSIL FUEL IT'S A BETTER TYPE OF ENERGY SOURCE
BYE BYE-BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
MAGNETS ARE MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
MAGNETS COULD STICK ON TO IRON THINGS
IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR IRON OR STEEL
THE REFRIGERATOR IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL MOST METAL THINGS SO THAT IT IS ATTRACTING MAGNET
THEY ARE BOTH MADE OUT OF IRON
THEY BOTH HAVE IRON OR METAL IN IT OR METAL THAT HAS IRON IN IT
UM
I THINK THE MAGNETS STICK
THE ONES THAT STICK THAT'S THE ONES THAT HAVE IRON STICK
IT WON'T STICK
MICROPHONE
NO I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL IRON IN IT
BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE MAGNET WHAT MAGNET COULD STICK
THEY REPEL EACH OTHER WHEN SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEN ONE THE SOUTH AND NORTH THEY
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND THEIR NORTH AND SOUTH
TWO MAGNETS BASICALLY NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
THE MAGNETS AND THE PAPERCLIPS ARE ATTRACTING TO THROUGH PAPER
THAT IT'S REALLY THICK SO IT WON'T
I MEAN
WEIGHING BIGGER SO THAT THE MAGNETS CAN BEAR THE WEIGHT TOGETHER
THE AMOUNT OF SPACERS SLIGHTLY MAKING THAT RIGHT AND GOING
IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD NOT STICK THAT STRONG
IT MAKES THE MAGNET THE FIELD BREAK
THE OTHER END CUP GOES DOWN
THE AMOUNT OF MAGNETISM THAT ARE THERE FIELD MAGNETIC FIELD IS JUST SLIGHTLY LIKE THAT
OH IT'S OTHER END GO DOWN
IT MAKES THE FLOW SLOWLY LIKE DIVE
IT IT GOES DOWN BUT THEN IT ALSO GOES SIDE
YOU HAVE USE LESS SPACERS
BECAUSE WHEN THERE ARE IS ONLY WHEN THERE IS
THEIR MAGNETIC FIELDS WON'T GO TOGETHER
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A MAGNET
THERE ARE WASHES BATTERIES A STEEL RIVET WIRES AND
YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE CORD WITH WIRE UNLESS THERE WILL BE NO ELECTRIC CHARGE INSIDE THE RIVET
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE ON THEN THE ENERGY WON'T GO
IT IS
WHEN IT'S OPEN THEN IT CAN PICK THINGS UP AND IT JUST DROPS THE STEEL WASHER
IT PICKS UP THINGS BUT IF BUT IF IT DOESN'T DO THAT THEN YOU JUST DOESN'T DONE
THERE IS A THERE IS A BIG MAGNETIC AREA MAGNETIC FIELD
HAS TO WORK TOGETHER UNLESS IT IT'S ONLY A MAGNET OR IT'S ONLY ELECTRICITY
IT MAKE SURE THAT WIRES WRAPPED ABOUT THE STEEL
IT CAN PICK UP THINGS BUT IF THE STEEL BUT IF THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF THEN IT CAN'T PICK UP THINGS OR JUST
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FLOW OF ELECTRICITY THEN IT CAN'T GO
THE ELECTROMAGNET IS OFF THEN THE SWITCH IS OFF BUT IF THE SWITCH IS ON THEN THE ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET IS ON
THE POSITON OF THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON TO MAKE THE ELECTRO-MAGNET WORK BUT IF IT'S OFF THEN THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T
THE SUMMARY IS THAT
BECAUSE I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IF THE CLOSED
THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF AND THE WIRE HAS TO BE AND THE WIRE HAS TO THE WIRE HAS TO BE ON
IT IS GOING THROUGH IT HAS TO THE SWITCH HAS TO BE
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
A D CELL BATTERY TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
COMPONENTS
THE BATTERY IS THE POWER SOURCE OF THE CIRCUIT
ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
THE NEGATIVE END
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID
THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF POWER POWERING THE LIGHT BULB
THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT IF IT IF THE ELECTRICITY MUST COME FROM THE POSITIVE END
THE LIGHT BULB WILL EITHER NOT LIGHT OR EXPLODE
THE NEGATIVE END
THIS SETUP IS A BULB SETUP USING A SIMPLE BATTERY TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
IT THE WIRES CHANGED POSITIONS AND THE THE BULB IS STILL LIGHTED LIT
VERY GOOD THANK YOU
SO FAR WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING MUCH BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY DO SCIENCE
A MOTOR IS BEING POWERED BY A BATTERY
THE MOTOR IS ON
ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES TO POWER THE MOTOR
THE MOTOR MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IN THE CORRECT WAY
POWER THE BATTERY BY USING ELECTRICITY FROM BATTERY
THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
IT'S ALL SLOW STOPS
THE SWITCH MUST BE CLOSED HOW WOULD I DO THAT
IF YOU CLICK ON THE SWITCH ONCE IT CLOSES IF YOU CLICK ON IT AGAIN THE MOTOR WILL STOP
SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP
IT NEEDS SOME KIND OF ENERGY
ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL AND INTO THE MOTOR POWERING IT
IT DOESN'T USE COAL WHICH IS WHERE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM IN THIS STATE
THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
I CANNOT HEAR YOU
ALL MATERIALS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY ARE METALLIC OR MADE OF METAL
THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN THAT IS BECAUSE AS SPONGE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR NOR INSULATOR
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
THEY ARE USED AS A DEVICE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE DARK
THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY
THE MOVING BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY USED HOLD ON A SECOND
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW BACKWARDS THE POWER IS ON LIGHTS LONGER
OKAY I HAVE DONE THAT
ONE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO CREATE ONE COMPLETE PATHWAY
THEY GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER THEM BRIGHTLY
IF THAT ONLY WORKS IF THE ENERGY IS COMING FROM THE WRONG PARTS OF THE BATTERY
TURNING AROUND ONE OF THE BATTERIES
THAT WAS A LITTLE BORING THOUGH
GREAT THANKS FOR ASKING
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT TWO BULBS BRIGHTLY WITH ONE D-CELL
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH SIDES WORK THE SAME
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS
IT HAS TWO PATH WAYS SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
IT SHOWS YOU THE PATH WAY OF THE ELECTRICITY
LIGHTS WILL GIVE BRIGHTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY
THE MORE BATTERIES THERE ARE THE MORE ENERGY THERE IS
I DO NOT KNOW WELL I NEED YOU TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID
THE BOY WOULD ANSWER THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
BRIGHTNESS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD DOING THAT
WE HAVE BEEN TESTING WHAT THINGS STICK TO MAGNETS
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE REFRIGERATOR TO THE CAUSE OF MAGNETISM
IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL STEEL IS MAGNETIC SO IS IRON WITH CARBON
STEEL BECAUSE STEEL IS MAGNETIC ALUMINIUM ISN'T
AH HELLO
STEEL OR IRON YES
THE PAPERCLIP WILL STICK BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
IT'S MADE OUT OF THE STEEL OR IRON
IF IT'S MADE OF STEEL IT MIGHT HAVE IRON IN IT IF IT'S MADE OF IRON IT MIGHT HAVE STEEL IN IT
WHY THINGS STICK TO MAGNETS
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW MAGNETS WORK
ROD MAGNETS BEING BREAKING APART
THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER
THE MAGNET IS REPELLING
THAT'S HOW MAGNETS WORK I GUESS THAT'S WHY
ATTRACTING AND REPELLING COMBINATIONS
THEY STICK TOGETHER AND THE POLES ARE DIFFERENT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS
THE FARTHER THE DISTANCE THE WEAKER THE MAGNETISM
THE MAGNET AND THE PAPERCLIP ARE NOT STICKING TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK
BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ROOM FOR THE MAGNET TO STICK
WHEN YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF THE NAIL TURNS INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET NOT A PERMANENT
THE MAGNET IS SHARING ITS MAGNETIC ENERGY WITH THE NAIL
THE MAGNET IS SHARING ITS MAGNETIC ENERGY WITH THE NAIL MAGNETIZING THE STEEL PAPERCLIP
THE MAGNET IS THE PAPERCLIP IS BEING TAKEN OFF OF THE NAIL
MAGNETIC ENERGY IS TO ATTRACT
PLEASE REPEAT THAT
GOOD THANK YOU
MAGNETS
THE PAPER THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS LARGE ENOUGH
HOW MUCH WEIGHT DOES IT REQUIRE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF TWO MAGNETS
LOTS AND LOTS OF WASHERS
I HAVE ALL OF THE RESULTS EXCEPT I MADE A MISTAKE SO I DON'T HAVE ANY RESULTS FOR TWO SPACERS
USING SPACERS THE MORE SPACERS YOU USE THE FURTHER THAT MAGNETS ARE APART THE WEAKER THE MAGNETISM
THE NUMBER DECREASES
IT WEAKENS THE MAGNET
HOW TO TURN A STEEL RIVET INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET
I THINK THE WIRE PROVIDES POWER FOR THE STEEL RIVET AND THEN STEEL RIVET TURNS INTO A MAGNET THAT CAN BE TURNED ON AND OFF
THE WHAT DID YOU SAY
IT'S SPINNING OVER IT PROVIDES A MAGNETIC FIELD FOR THE STEEL RIVET
THE POWER YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS THE ENERGY YOU NEED ENOUGH POWER
WHEN ELECTROMAGNETS ARE BASICALLY MAGNETS POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
SWITCHES PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO THOSE SWITCHES PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO TURN IT ON AND OFF
THE SWITCH CAN TURN CIRCUITS ON AND OFF
IT CLOSES AND THE MAGNETS COME UP TO THE STEEL RIVET
SOMETIMES THEY'RE CALLED TEMPORARY MAGNETS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO WEAK THEY DON'T LAST LONG ENOUGH
WELL SOMETIMES THE FORCES SO WEAK YOU PICK IT UP AND THEN THE PIECE FALLS LAW
IT PROVIDES A WIDE ENOUGH MAGNETIC FIELDS TO PICK UP THESE SMALL DISCS
THE WIRES PROVIDE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POWER AND THE STEEL RIVET PROVIDES SOMETHING TO PUT IT ON
IF IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRAPPED AROUND SOMETHING MADE OF STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY METALS ARE MAGNETIC
IT'S A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
THERE IS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE END WHICH CAN BE CALLED AS A TERMINAL
FLOWS THE UM YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WHICH FLOWS THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT
IT FLOWS THE IT FLOWS THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT IT
RECEIVES LIGHT FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
I SEE ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOW UNDER THE WIRES INTO AROUND THE STRINGS THEN BACK OUT THE BOTTOM INTO THE D CELL BATTERY
ELECTRIC CURRENT THAT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END
FLOWS FROM THE POSITIVE END THROUGH THE ELECTRIC D CELL BATTERY AND OUT THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE
CAN BE SWITCHED BACK AND STILL WOULD WHEN IT'S SWITCHED BACK IT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY
THE ELECTRIC CURRENT CONTINUES TO GO AROUND IN A CIRCLE
THE COMPONENTS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE OFF ONE WIRE THE ELECTRIC CURRENT STOPS
WOULD FLOW OUT WITHOUT THE WIRE ON THERE SO IT COULDN'T GO INTO THE D CELL WHICH WOULD STOP THE CIRCUIT
THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO DO SOLAR PANELS AND HOW TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN WITH SOLAR PANELS
THE MOTOR RECEIVES THE ENERGY TO START SPINNING FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
ELECTRIC MUST GO FROM THE D CELL BATTERY INTO THE MOTOR
WHEN THE LATCH IS DOWN AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND THE LATCH IS DOWN THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING
SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T RUN
WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING AGAIN
IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN IT STOPS THE CIRCUIT FROM GOING TO THE MOTOR
YOU HAVE TO PUT THE SWITCH ON SO THAT THE CIRCUIT IS COMPLETE
WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH CLOSES THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE CIRCUIT ISN'T COMPLETE SO THEN THE MOTOR CAN'T RUN
THEY ARE A REPLACEMENT FOR BATTERIES THAT USE THE SUN
SOLAR PANEL HAS TO BE SHOWING HAS TO BE OUT IN THE SUN
WITHOUT THE ELECTRICITY OF THE SOLAR PANEL THE MOTOR WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN
THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T MAKE ANY ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOR WOULDN'T RUN
BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUN FOR IT TO COLLECT ELECTRICITY OUT OF
WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING BUT WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
SUN IS OUT THEN THE SOLAR PANEL WILL COLLECT THE SOLAR POWER WHICH WILL POWER THE MOTOR
THINK ABOUT ONE THING WHAT THINGS ARE CONDUCTORS AND WHAT THINGS ARE INSULATORS
THERE IS A BATTERY AND ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE MOTOR
THE THINGS THAT HELP THAT HELP THE MOTOR RUN ARE MADE OF METAL
THEY ARE MADE FROM METAL WHICH CAN HELP THE MOTOR RUN
FOR THE METAL ONES ARE THE ONES MADE OF METAL THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING THE ONE THEY ARE NOT MADE OF METAL THE MOTOR DOESN'T START RUNNING
CONDUCT HOW CONDUCTOR HELPS ENERGY FLOW FROM AND IT CONDUCTS ENERGY
CONDUCTORS HAVE TO BE MADE OF METAL TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THE ENERGY TO SOURCE
THE BRASS RING WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
I SEE LIGHT ON A CANDLE
LIGHT AND ENERGY IS BLEND BECAUSE A LIGHTS HELP
FUELS START
THE CANDLE IS STARTING TO BE BURNED ITS STARTS TO MELT
IT IS HOLDING THE FIRE SO WHEREVER THE FIRE GOES ITS STAYS ALONG WITH IT
IT SOUND IS FLICKERING ITS SOUNDED FLICKERING
THE ANSWER HITTING ON A DRUM
IT MAKES A SOUND
BY EATING AND DRINKING
THREE APPLES A CANDLE DESK LOGS AND A FUEL
THIS POLLUTION
THINK WHAT HAPPENS ONLY ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS TAKEN
IT SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FUELS
THEY ALL COLLECT ENERGY
THEY ALL CAN USE IT YOU CAN BOTH USE IT TO BURN THINGS TO START FIRE
GAS IS A LIQUID COAL IS A SOLID
THAT ALL KINDS OF WILD THINGS YOU CAN RENEW THE ENERGY LIKE THE SUN IT CAN YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE THE ENERGY
LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
OKAY SOMETHING THAT TRANSFERS ENERGY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
IN A CIRCUIT THERE ARE WIRES SO THE ENERGY TRANSFERS IN THE WIRE
D-CELL BATTERIES TRANSFERRING ENERGY FROM IT AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THAT
SO IT HAS TO FLOW FROM THE D THAT WHAT TO SAY IT HAS TO FLOW FROM THE D-CELL BATTERY INTO LIGHT BULB TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB GET THE ENERGY AND LIGHT UP
D-CELL BATTERY HAS THE ENERGY THE WIRES TRANSFER THE ENERGY AND LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES
FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTER THROUGH THE FILAMENT OF BOTH LIGHT BULBS
ARE PART OF THE ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
TWO PATHWAYS ONE TO GO TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB IN THE OTHER ONE TO GO TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
PATHWAYS FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH
THE LIGHT BULB WILL SHINE DIMLY
THE FILAMENT IS GETTING BURNT OUT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS
WELL CIRCUIT DOES INTO AN EIGHT WHILE THE SERIES CIRCUIT JUST DOES INTO A NORMAL CIRCLE
THESE LIGHT MORE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY TO FLOW TO THE LIGHT BULBS
THERE'S MORE ENERGY THAN THE LIGHT BULB WILL BE ABLE TO LIGHT UP SOME MORE BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE MORE ENERGY TO LIGHT UP
ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE D-CELL BATTERY AND HAS BE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT TO ABLE TO LIGHT UP LIGHTBULB
PARALLEL THERE ARE MORE PATHWAYS FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT THAN A SERIES CIRCUIT
IT FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE AND FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
THE FILAMENT IS RUNNING OUT
THEY ARE TWO LIGHT BULBS NOW SO THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT MORE
THE LIGHT BULB SHINE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM CIRCUIT IS HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S FLOWING NORMAL AND IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND IT'S NOT SHAPE LIKE ANY
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
STRINGS OF LIGHTS HELP TRANSFER ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT BULB TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB FORM ONE BATTERY TO ANOTHER
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A OPEN WHICH CAUSE WHICH CAUSE A CLOSED CIRCUIT
ALL THE OTHER BULB SWITCH RUN OUT TOO
ENERGY TRANSFERS AROUND TO THE CIRCLE AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT
THE OTHER ONE TURNS OUT OF THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THEN ALL THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS DO NOT
CONNECTED THEY ARE CONNECTED IN A CIRCLE
IT DOES LIKE CAN THE ELECTRICITY
THE OTHER IT'S STOPS FROM GOING OVER THE FILAMENT
OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T BURNT OUT THOUGH
THE OTHER ONES STILL HAS ITS LIGHT
BULBS EVEN IF ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER WAS STILL CONTINUE TO LIGHT UP
THE FLOW OF ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY IS STILL HAPPENS LIKE A SERIES CIRCUIT
NOT TO THE BULB TO THE D-CELL BATTERY SO THEY ALL HAVE ENERGY ALL THEY HAVE WIRES WITH THE ENERGY FOR EACH OF THEM
WASN'T EFFECT THE OTHER BULB BECAUSE THERE'RE NOT CONNECTED TOGETHER SO IT DOESN'T EFFECT
ONE IS THE FILAMENT IS STILL LOW OKAY BUT THE OTHER THE FIRST LIGHT BULB HAVE ITS FILAMENT IS BROKEN
BECAUSE THEN ALL THE ELECTRIC CURRENT STOP MOVING SO THEN I CAN'T GO TO
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
MAGNET ATTRACT IRON AND STEEL
MAGNETS ATTRACT ONLY IRON AND STEEL
IT'S THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THE MAGNET WILL ATTRACT
THE MAGNET NOT THE MAGNET IS NOT ATTRACTING
THE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENDS OF A MAGNET WILL STICK AND SAME SIDES OF A MAGNETS WILL REPEL
A MAGNET IS ATTRACTING A STEEL NAIL
NAILS EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
IT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
OH YARN WON'T STICK TO MAGNET
THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET ARE MADE OF STEEL OR IRON IRON OR STEEL WILL STICK TO MAGNET
THE WOODBLOCK CAN'T THE MAGNET CAN'T ATTRACT THE WOODBLOCK BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
MAGNET CAN'T STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT MADE STEEL OR IRON ANYTHING ELSE MADE STEEL IRON CAN STICK TO MAGNETS
WHICH IS MADE OF EITHER OR STEEL OR IRON WHILE THE WOODBLOCK IS MADE IS NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
THE NAILS MADE OF STEEL AND IRON BUT THE WOODBLOCK IS MADE OF WOOD NOT STEEL OR IRON
MAGNETS STICK TO STEEL OR IRON WHICH IS A KIND OF METAL
ALL METALS WILL BE ABLE TO STICK TO MAGNET ONLY STEEL AND IRON WILL BE ABLE TO
THINS HAD STICKS MAGNETS ARE MADE ARE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF STEEL OR IRON IN THEM
I WAS STICK BECAUSE IT MIGHT STICK
IT STICKS BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF EITHER STEEL OR IRON
THE PAPERCLIP MIGHT HAVE STEEL OR IRON IN IT
ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT STICKS TO THEM
THE METALS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER BECAUSE ONE IS FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES ATTRACTS EACH OTHER
NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH WHICH THEN MEANS THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTACK TO EACH OTHER
AND SOUTH NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL SOUTH AND NORTH ATTRACT
WHEN THEY REPEL EACH OTHER THEY HAVE A SAME SIDES LIKE NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH
NORTH AND SOUTH IS ON THE FIRST STILL THEN THE OTHERS ARE THE OPPOSITE
AND IN EARTH THERE IS A NORTH AND SOUTH POLE
ABOUT SOME WALKING AND THEY FOLLOW THE NORTH WHICHEVER THE WAY IS NORTH
IT ATTRACTS TO THE MAGNETS
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
METAL CAN ATTRACT IRON SOME SORTS SUCH AS IRON OR STEEL
WHEREVER THE MAGNET IS THE MAGNET CAN STICK TO ANOTHER MAGNET UNDER BETWEEN THINGS THROUGH THINGS
THE MAGNET CAN STICK CAN I CHECK THE OTHER MAGNET THROUGH THE TABLE
WHEN THE MAGNETS ON THEIR TABLE AND IT'S START MOVING THE OTHER MAGNET OR CHAIR ALONG
BEST FORCE TO MAKE A MAGNET TO MAKE SOMETHING MOVE
IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO MOVE
THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL BECOMES A MAGNET SO THEN THE PAPERCLIP STICKS TO STEEL NAIL
THE MAGNET IS A MAGNET AND WHEN IT TOUCHES THE STEEL NAIL THE STEEL NAIL BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET
WHEN THE MAGNET IS GONE THEN THE NAIL CAN'T ATTRACT THE PAPERCLIP
PUT ON THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL THEN THE NAIL CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP BUT EVERY TIME THE MAGNET IS NOT THERE IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP
THE NAIL NO LONGER HAS IT'S MAGNETISM IN IT
BECAUSE THE NAIL DOESN'T HAVE THE MAGNETISM ANYMORE
IS SHOWING WHAT IS STUCK WHAT IS STICKING
MAGNETS CAN STICK DOUBLE
WHICH MAGNETS HOW MUCH BRASS RINGS CAN EQUAL THE MAGNETISM OF MAGNETS
THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP PAST THE BIG THICK STACK OF PAPERS
ONCE I GET TO WASHERS THE MAGNETISM BREAKS
ONCE YOU'VE ADD A BRASS RING THE MAGNETISM STARTS TO GET HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER
HOW MANY BRASS RINGS IT TAKE IT TAKES BRASS RINGS SO THAT THE MAGNETISM WILL BREAK AND SO THAT THE CUP WILL NOT STICK TO THE OTHER ONE
THAT KEEPS IN GETTING LOSER AND LOSER AND FINALLY CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE SO THEN IT BREAKS
YOU ADD WASHERS THEN THE MAGNETS AND THE MAGNETS ON THE LEFT WILL LET GO
WHEN THERE IS NOTHING IN THE CUP THEN THE MAGNETISM CAN STICK
SPACERS SAY HOW MANY IT TAKES WHERE THE WASHERS TO WITH TO RAISE WITH ONE SPACER
THERE'S HOW MANY SPACERS A TAKE TO RAISE STUFF
THE MAGNETS ARE SLOWLY SEPARATING EACH OTHER
THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER
THIS SPACER IS PUSHING THE MAGNET UP AND APART
IT'S SEPARATING FOR SO IT'S NOT SO STRONG ANYMORE NOW
THE FORCE CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE SPACERS THAT MUCH NOW SO THERE IS LITTLE
THE MORE SPACERS THERE'S WAS THE LESS WASHERS WERE THE CAN TO BREAK THE MAGNETISM
YOU ADD MORE SPACERS
I'M CHOOSE IT A LESS STRONGER
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO TURN THE RIVET INTO A MAGNET THAT CAN TURN ON AND OFF
IT TRANSFERS THE ENERGY SO THE MORE IT'S WRAPPED AROUND THE MORE ENERGY IT CAN GO FASTER FASTER TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE AND MORE
THE RIVET WOULD STOP ATTRACTING LITTLE WASHERS
THEN THE RIVET THEN THE RIVET WOULD START WORKING
THE AREA AROUND THE WRAP WIRE STARTS GOING AROUND IN COILS DOWN TO THE RIVET AND EVERY TIME THAT DOES THAT IT ATTRACTS THE MAGNET
THE SWITCH MAKES THE RIVET TURN TO MAKE THE MAGNETISM IN THE RIVET TURN ON AND OFF
WHICH MEANS THAT THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH ENERGY THEY WON'T BE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH SO IT CAN'T GET TO THE RIVET
THE SWITCH IS TO TURN THE MAGNETISM ON AND OFF
THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT BUT IT WON'T LAST FOREVER
IF ELECTRICITY IT FLOWS THROUGH IT CAN GET TO THE RIVET SO THAT WAY THE RIVET WILL HAVE THE MAGNETISM
THERE HAS TO BE EITHER OR MAGNET
MAGNETS METAL CAN BECOME TEMPORARY MAGNET
THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES AND ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS
THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE THING IN EACH THING
ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THE ONE RIGHT IS NOT A MIXTURE
IT'S BEING SEPARATED
THE MIXTURES ARE BEING SEPARATED
IT'S GETTING SEPARATED BY ONE OF THE WINDOW THINGY
THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE MARBLES AND THE WATER
THEY GOT
IT'S IT IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S BEING SEPARATED
THE WATER WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE ITEM AND IT WILL BECOME A LIQUID
IT WILL IT WILL FORM INTO LIKE A I'M NOT QUITE FOR SURE
A DISSOLVING COMPONENT
A FILTER IN A FUNNEL HOLDER
NO BECAUSE IT WAS A POWDER AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO IN WATER AND YOU CAN NOT SEPARATE IT
GOOD BYE
MARNIE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE SALT WENT TO EVAPORATED AND THE SAND JUST WENT TO THE BOTTOM
THE SALTS WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE MASS GETS BIGGER AS YOU ADD BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE
THE TERM IS A MIXTURE
MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
I NOTICED THAT THE WATER IS GETTING MIXED IN IT OR THE ITEM IS GETTING MIXED INTO THE WATER
IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE MORE THAN ONE BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE MORE THAN ONE ITEM IN THE CUP
IT'S A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE ITEM IS IN THE CUP AND IT'S NOT SEPARATED
IT'S A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE SAND IS IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER IS CLEAR AND IT HAS NOTHING IN IT
MARNIE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
MARNIE I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
IT'S EVAPORATING AND THUS AND THE SAND WON'T MORE EVAPORATE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TOO HEAVY
EVAPORATING IT IS EVAPORATING
AH
YOU COULD REEVAPORATE IT
A LOT OF TIME AND A MIXTURE OF SALT AND WATER
BYE BYE-BYE
I'M DOING GOOD
THE MAGNET IS COLLECTING ALL THE MAGNETISED ITEMS WITH ALL THE DRY ITEMS
I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT A SCREEN CAN SEPARATE ITEMS LIKE WATER AND GRAVEL
MARNIE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT IS SHOWING THAT A SCREEN CAN SEPARATE TWO ITEMS OR MORE
MARNIE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE MAGNETS THAT THE MAGNETS HAD GOT ALL THE MAGNETIZED ITEMS OUT OF THE CUP
I DON'T KNOW MARNIE
MARNIE I CANNOT SEE THE PICTURE CAN YOU HELP ME PLEASE
IT EVAPORATED THE SALT EVAPORATING
IF YOU PUT THE SALT IN THE EVAPORATING TRAY AND IT'S YEAH
THE SOLUTION AH NOTHING
MARNIE I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY BYE-BYE BYE-BYE BYE
I AM GOOD MARNIE HOW ARE YOU
IF IT IS
WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING OTHER ITEMS TO ONE BIG ITEM
ONE IS TEN GRAMS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER
I NOTICED THAT ONE IS ON LIKE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE HEAVIER AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS LIGHTER
THE ONE THAT HAS MORE SALT IS MORE OR MORE DRINK MAKES IT MORE CONCENTRATED
MARNIE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE SECOND ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS MOST ITEMS IN IT
THE ONE ON THE ONE ON THE FIRST AND THE THIRD ONE ARE NOT CONCENTRATED
SOLUTION B IS THE HEAVIEST SOLUTION
GOOD MARNIE HOW ARE YOU
IT WILL FLOAT TO THE BOTTOM
IT WILL JUST GO TO THE BOTTOM
THEY WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX OF WATER
THAT SOLUTION A HAS NO SALT AND SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT
FROM MASS OF SALT IN EACH SOLUTION
THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS HAVE TO GO ON THE TOP BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PUT IT ON THE TOP THEN IT WILL MIX IN
THEY ARE SEPARATING
THEY'RE GOING TO MIX TOGETHER
THEY ARE MIXING
IT WILL MIX WITH THE HEAVY SOLUTION
BECAUSE THE MORE SOLUTION HAS X GRAMS OF SALT EXPENSIVE SALT AND SO THEN SO SHOULD BE IT SHOULD HAS MORE GRAMS OF SALT
THEY ARE NOT MIXING
WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW IF TWO DIFFERENT SALTS ARE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT
THAT IT IS CLEAR AND IT'S WATER AND IT HAS FIFTY MILLILITERS
IT IS NOT DISSOLVING
THAT IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE MADE A SOLUTE THAT IS NOT VERY CONCENTRATED
IT IS DISSOLVING
BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH SALT IN THE WATER THAT IT WILL NOT DISSOLVE
IT IS DISSOLVING AND AFTER THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT IT IS NOT DISSOLVED
THE WATER'S TOO CONCENTRATED IT CAN'T HANDLE ANY MORE DISSOLVED
I'M SORRY IT IS DISSOLVING AND NOT ALL OF IT DISSOLVED
IT IS DISSOLVING
THAT THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN THE WATER
MARNEY I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN DOING EVAPORATING ITEMS
THAT THE EPSOM SALT CAN ADD SCOOPS AND IT WON'T DISSOLVE AND IT WILL DISSOLVE
THAT ONE ISN'T DISSOLVING VERY MUCH THAN THE OTHER
WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT
IT IT TOOK IT CAN THAT SOME ITEMS CAN TAKE MORE THAN ANY OTHERS
THAT IT IS DISSOLVING
IT IS TAKING LONGER TO DISSOLVE
OKAY OKAY
THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT CRYSTAL DESIGNS
THAT THE CHART HAS THE CORRECT ANSWERS
BY LOOKING AT THE CRYSTALS
SALT CRYSTALS
EPSOM SALT
BAKING SODA MADE THE VINEGAR GO BUBBLY
THE PRODUCT WAS FIZZING AND BUBBLING
WHAT BAKING SODA WHAT BAKING SODA AND HOW BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR DO TOGETHER
BUBBLING AND FIZZING
A SOLUTION AND A MIXTURE NO A SOLUTION
THEY ARE ALL A TYPE OF SOLID
WATER
MOLECULES THE MOLECULES LOOK THE SAME ON IN THE MIDDLE THAN THE
THEY ARE GOOD I GUESS
YES SOME OF THEM DO BUT THE YELLOW IN THE VINEGAR DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE YELLOW IN THE SOLUTION
THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE WHOLE NUMBERS
BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE
PARTICIPATION PARTICIPATE
IT'S A SOLUTION
THE WATER LOOKS THE SAME AFTER THE THE ACID AND THE SODIUM
IT IS AS CLEAR AS THE WATER AT FIRST
YES IT CAN NOT IT CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT MOLECULES
I THINK THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE'S BUBBLES IN THE WATER
SOME OF THE ICE MELTED AND THE ICE WENT ALL TO THE SIDES OF THE CUP
THAT SOME OF THE ICE IS DISSOLVING AND IT'S TURNING INTO AN ACID FROM THE CUP
THE WATER BUBBLES AND THEN IT'S A AND THEN IT'S A SOLUTION
NO BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE FOR A CHEMICAL REACTION
THAT AFTER THEY HAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SEEMS IT STAYED OUTSIDE TOO LONG
WHEN YOU BEND IT IT WILL GLOW
SOLUTION
IT'S NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT IT IS
BYE
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU TODAY MARNEY
I SEE I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT HAPPENS CAUSE THERE'S A CERTAIN THING
THAT TWO ITEMS HAVE CREATED A SALT CRYSTALS
I NOTICE THAT IT HAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SINCE THE BAG INCREASED ITS SIZE
THAT IT HAD SOME OXYGEN IN IT
THAT IT THAT IT IS GOING TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW
I SEE WATER AND BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
THAT THAT THE BAG HAD INCREASED IT'S SIZE
I'M NOT QUITE FOR SURE
THE WATER IS YEAH
THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPENED AND ONE BAG IS
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING MIXTURES
THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER WITH SOMETHING
WATER AND MARBLES
PEANUTS AND RAISINS THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE RIGHT IS NOT
IT IS CALLED A MIXTURE
MIXTURES
THE TRAIL MIX IS SEPARATING
THE RAISINS IN IMMENSE AND PEANUTS ARE SEPARATING
THEY ARE SEPARATING INTO THE DIFFERENT PARTS
THEY ARE SEPARATING
THE MARBLES ARE LANDING ON THE SCREEN WHILE THE WATER GOES INTO THE BOWL
THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON A SCREEN WHILE THE WATER GOES INTO THE BOWL
WHEN IT WAS POURED THE MARBLES STAY ON THE SCREEN WHILE THE WATER WENT INTO THE BOWL
BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED BACK TO NORMAL
THE SAND IN WATER ARE SEPARATING
THE DIRTY WATER MIX WHILE THE WET CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS STAY
IT BECOMES SALT WATER
THE SALT DISSOLVES AND BECOMES SALT WATER
IT IS GOING TOGETHER AND CANNOT BE SEPARATED
A MIXTURE YOU CAN SEPARATE WHILE THE SOLUTION STAYS TOGETHER
GOOD BYE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
I MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER MAKES A SOLUTION
IF THE SOLID INTO A LIQUID SOMETIMES IT WILL DISSOLVE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
THE SAND BECOMES CLEAR WHILE THE SAND IS DARKER
THE SALT DISSOLVE BUT THE SAND DIDN'T SO IT SUNK TO THE BOTTOM
BECAUSE THEY DISSOLVE IN A LIQUID
THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE LIQUID TO MAKE A SOLUTION
THAT IT HAS MORE THAN THE ADDED
THAT THE WATER GETS HEAVIER ONCE THE SALT IS ADDED
THAT IT GETS HEAVIER
IT GETS EVERYTHING IN IT
IT BECOMES HEAVIER
IT GETS HEAVIER
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
BY A FILTER
THE FLOUR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
IT IS A SOLUTION
IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
THE SALT IS BECOMING A SOLUTION IN THE WATER
EVAPORATION
THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS SEPARATED
IT BECOMES A SOLUTION
WARM IN SUN
SOLUTIONS AND EVAPORATION
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THE MAGNET IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
THE SAND IS GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN WHILE THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ABOVE
IF I WANTED ROCKS WITH NO SAND
MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
THAT THE SAND IS GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN WHILE THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP
THAT THE MAGNET WAS ABLE TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE MIXTURE
BECAUSE THE ROCKS ARE BIGGER THAN THE SAND
THAT IT IS GETTING THE PAPER CLIPS CAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIC
BECAUSE SOME ARE SMALLER THAN OTHERS
THE WORK
BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
BECAUSE THE ROCKS WERE LARGE THEY DID NOT GO FOR THROUGH THE SCREEN
BECAUSE THE ROCKS WERE TOO BIG TO GO THROUGH
THE SAND WORKS BEST BECAUSE THE SAND PIECES WERE TOO BIG FOR THE FILTER
BECAUSE THE SAND IS TOO BIG TO GO THROUGH THE LITTLE FILTER PAPER
THE BEST WAY TO EVAPORATE A MIXTURE IS TO USE SALT
FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE WHILE THE SOLID SALT IS LEFT BEHIND
A MIXTURE
HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
VERY SMALL GRAPETASTIC IN ONE OF THE CUPS AND THE OTHER
WILL YOU REPEAT THAT
I DON'T KNOW
IT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT
IT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT
THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED AND CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS POWDER IN THEM
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH POWDER TO MAKE IT THICKER
THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE MIXTURES OF A GRAPETASTIC AND THAN THE OTHER ONE
MORE GRAPEY
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT WHICH SOLUTIONS ARE DENSER AND LESS DENSE
SOLUTION A DOESN'T HAVE ANY SALT WHILE SOLUTION B HAS SOME
PLEASE EXPLAIN MARNEY
THEY ARE ABLE TO STACK
ONE IS LIGHTER SO IT IS ON TOP IT WON'T MIX WITH SOLUTION B
ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER
THEY ARE ABLE TO STACK
THEY STACK
YOU PUT THE DENSER ONE YOU PUT THE DENSER ONE ON TOP OF THE LIGHTER ONE
BECAUSE THE DENSER ONE IS GOING ON TOP AND THE LESS DENSE ONE IS GOING ON THE BOTTOM SO THEY MIX
CAUSE ONE HAS MORE SALT MEANS THAT IS HEAVIER THAT'S THE ONE YOU PUT ON TOP SO IT MIXES
THE CAPTIONS UNDERNEATH THE CUPS AND THEY ARE STACKED IN THE BOTTLE
WE ARE READING ABOUT SOLUTION AND DISSOLVING
BY IT'S DISSOLVING
IT IS DISSOLVED
IT IS DISSOLVED
IT IS A SOLUTE
BECAUSE IT IS
IT IS A SOLUTION
IT IS A SOLUTE
IT IS BECOMING A SOLUTION MUCH EASIER
THE EPSOM SALT IS ON THE BOTTOM
ONE HAS SALT AND IT WAS THE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE THAT JUST HAS WATER
BY PUTTING GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE EMPTY CUP
THERE WAS A REACTION
IT BECOMES A REACTION WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
WHEN THE VINEGAR A REACTION AND THE BAKING SODA A REACTION MAKE A PRODUCT
THEY'RE ALL SOMETHINGS
THEY MIXED SOME SOLIDS
NO BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST PUT TOGETHER WAIT YEAH THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER WHICH CHANGED THEM
H TWO O
THAT IT BUBBLES AND FIZZES
THE VINEGAR THE PARTICLES ARE LOOSER WHILE THE BAKING SODA ARE TIGHTER WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY ARE TIGHTER WITH A LAYER OF
SOME ARE BLUE YELLOW GRAY
THAT WHEN MIXED TOGETHER THEY MAKE SOMETHING SKIP IT
NO THEY DO NOT THEY CHANGE WHEN THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER
CAUSE THEY MIX TOGETHER
IT'S A CUP FULL OF LIQUID WITH A BAKING SODA SPOON AND A CALCIUM CHLORIDE SPOON IN AN EMPTY CUP
IT BECOMES A SOLUTE BECAUSE THE BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE DID NOT DISSOLVE
I CAN NOT PRONOUNCE THE END
IT TAKES A COUPLE SCOOPS OF SODIUM CHLORIDE TO DISSOLVE INTO WATER
THAT SOME PARTICLES ARE CLOSER THAN OTHER
THERE IS MORE IT TURNS PURPLE
THAT THEY ALL LOOK LIKE MICKEY MOUSE HEADS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THEY CAN NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER AS A SOLUTION UNLESS YOU EVAPORATE THEM
A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ON THE OUTER SIDE OF THE CUP NOW
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THAT WHEN THE ICE CUBES ARE ADDED WATER COMES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP
TWO LIQUIDS ARE MAKING ANOTHER TYPE OF LIQUID THAT IS PINK
THAT BECAUSE THE WATER CHANGED COLORS AFTER THOSE THE TWO LIQUIDS ARE ADDED TOGETHER
YES THERE IS A REACTION OCCURING BECAUSE THE COLOR IS CHANGING WHEN THE TWO LIQUIDS MIX
FIRST IT FIZZES AND BUBBLES BUT LATER IT WILL CALM DOWN AND TURN INTO A SOLUTION
CAUSE WHEN IT FIRST STARTED IT DID NOT HAVE ANY BUBBLES IN IT AND WHEN IT ENDED IT DID NOT HAVE ANY BUBBLES IN IT
IT IS RUSTING FROM ALL THE LIQUID THAT WAS ON IT
YES BECAUSE THE METAL REACTS TO THE WETNESS AND RUSTS
I DID NOT SEE IT
WHAT IS GOING IS SOMEBODY TOOK SOME GREEN DYE FROM THE WATER IT IS NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S JUST TAKING IT OUT
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS OCCURING BECAUSE WHEN A DROP OF DYE IS PUT INTO WATER IS DISSOLVES AND MAKES THE WHOLE CUP OF WATER GREEN
THAT WHEN YOU BREAK IT A CHEMICAL REACTION HAPPENS AND IT STARTS TO GLOW
IT IS HAPPENING IS WHEN IT BREAKS A CHEMICAL REACTION HAPPENS AND IT STARTS TO GLOW
YES BECAUSE WHEN IT BREAKS IT STARTS TO GLOW
DISSOLVING GRAPETASTIC INTO THE WATER
IT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN GRAPETASTIC DISSOLVES INTO THE CUP OF WATER IT BECOMES JUICE
I DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT GRAPETASTIC INTO THE WATER IT BECOMES A SOLUTION AND BECOMES A JUICE
IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE TALKING TO YOU HAVE A HORRIBLE DAY BYE
THINGS
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
DIFFERENT MATERIALS BEING ADDED TOGETHER
IT KIND OF IS A SOLUTION
YES THERE ARE CRYSTALS BUT THEY LOOK LIKE SALT CRYSTALS
THAT IT IS THAT IT IS THE GAS FROM THE SOLUTION IS BLOWING UP THE BAG
WHEN THE PRODUCTS WERE IN THE BAG AND THE WATER PUT WAS PUT IN GASSES BLEW UP THE BAG
CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND WATER
A SOLID A LIQUID AND A GAS
THAT IT IS CREATING GASSES THAT DOES IT
BECAUSE TWO REACTIONS PLUS EQUALS ONE PRODUCT
THAT REACTIONS EQUALS ONE PRODUCT OR MORE
THAT ONE BAG THAT IS CLOSED IS HEAVIER THAN THE BAG THAT IS OPEN
THAT WHEN THE BAG IS CLOSED THE MASS IS LARGER AND WHEN THE BAG IS OPEN IT IS SMALLER
BECAUSE THE GASSES IN ONE BAG ARE STUCK IN IT AND THE ONE WITH IT OPEN IS NOT
THEY'RE ALL MIXED I DON'T KNOW
THEY ARE ALL MIXTURES
THERE'S A SALAD
THERE IS TRAIL MIX THAT IS MIXED
THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE NOT MIXED AND THE PILES THE PILE ON THE LEFT ARE MIXED
IT BECOMES A SEPARATED MIXTURE
THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED
THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TO THE MAIN PART OF THE MIXTURE
THEY ARE SEPARATED AND NOT A MIXTURE
THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED BY A SCREEN
THEY ARE BEING THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED
THE SCREEN HAS SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER AND IT IS NO LONGER A MIXTURE
THE THING HAS SEPARATED THE SANDS FROM THE WATER AND IT'S FROM THE FILTER PAPER
MIXTURES CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE FILTER PAPER
THERE IS NO SCREEN
THE SALT DISSOLVES AS YOU PUT THE WATER INTO THE CUP
THE SALT IS DISSOLVING FROM THE WATER
I DON'T KNOW
THE WATER GETS HIGHER AND HEAVIER AS THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AS BE REGULAR CUP OF WATER
A SEPARATED MIXTURE
THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER AND MAKES THE WATER HEAVIER AND HIGHER
SALT
SALTED MATERIAL
ONE OF THE MIX PART OF THE MIXTURES HAS TO BE A SOLIDS WE SEPARATED
ONE IS A SOLID AND ONE'S NOT
THERE IS A SOLUTION FOR EACH OF THE MIXTURES
THE SAND DISSOLVES INTO THE I MEAN THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND TURNS THE WATER INTO A BROWNISH COLOR
WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER THE SALT DISSOLVED
THE LIQUID
THE SALT AND THE WATER ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT GETS KEEPS ON DISSOLVING AS THE WATER MIXES INTO THE SALT
THE ROLE IS THE
THE LIQUID
AS YOU MIX ALL OF THE MATERIALS TOGETHER IT MAKES A LARGER AMOUNT AND A BIGGER SOLUTION
I NOTICE THAT THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
THE MORE YOU ADD STUFF THE BIGGER IT GETS
WELL IT'S NOT THE SAME
THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER AS YOU ADD MORE STUFF INTO THE MIXTURE
THE MORE YOU ADD THE SALT INTO THE WATER THE BIGGER IT GETS COMPARED TO THE WEIGHTS YOU PUT IN
THAT EVEN ON THE SALT IS A SMALLER THING THAT IT MAKES THE WATER WEIGH MORE
A SOLUTION
BY USING A SCREEN OR FILTER PAPER
I THINK IT'S PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
YES BY USING CERTAIN MATERIALS TO SPLIT IT APART
EVEN THOUGH YOU COULDN'T SEE THE EPSOM SALT WHEN YOU POURED IT INTO THE CUP IT STILL CAME OUT WHEN YOU POURED IT INTO THE PAPER
IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
IT MEANS THAT THE SAND HAS NOT IT HAS SEPARATED FROM THE MIXTURE AND BECOME A SOLUTION
YES IF YOU USE THE RIGHT MATERIALS
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE BECAUSE WHATEVER IS MIXED TOGETHER BECOMES A MIXTURE
WE MAKE IT INTO A MIXTURE
THE WATER IS SLOWLY EVAPORATING FROM THE MIXTURE
IT HAS TO DO WITH SEPARATING A SOLUTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THAT'S SEPARATING IT
WE COULD MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING
I NOTICE THAT OVER TIME THE WATER IS DISAPPEARING SLOWLY AND LEAVING CRYSTALS IN ITS PLACE
SOMETHING BRIGHT TO MAKE THE WATER DISSOLVE
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK MIGHT BE THE TIME PASSING AS THE WATER EVAPORATES FROM THE SALT
WE LEARN THAT EVAPORATION CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE ACCORDING TO A TIME
I AM GOOD
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A DRY MIXTURE
WE SEPARATED A GROUP OF DRY MATERIALS AND MADE IT INTO A MIXTURE AND WE SEPARATED IT
WE COULD PROBABLY USE A MAGNET
CAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
THERE IS GRAVEL AND THE WATER AND THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE GRAVEL AND THE WATER
IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT A MIXTURE CAN BE SEPARATED BY A SCREEN
TO SEPARATE THE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
A MAGNET
THEY WERE A FUNNEL NOT A MAGNET A SCREEN AND SOME FILTER PAPER
MIXTURES
BECAUSE THE MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY REQUIRE DIFFERENT TOOLS TO BE SEPARATED TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SOLUTION
I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM WATER AND THE SALT
BECAUSE METAL IS ATTRACTED TO MAGNETS AND SO THE PAPER CLIPS WILL BE PICKED UP THROUGH THE WATER AND THE POWDER
NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN UNLIKE THE BIGGER PIECES THAT DON'T GO
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN
WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE IT WOULD SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE WATER
IT IS THE WATER AND THE SALT AND HOW IT MAKES THE CRYSTALS
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW DRY MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THAT IF ALL SOLUTIONS CAN BE MADE FROM A SOFT DRINK WITH A SOLID AND WATER
SHE CALLED THEM CONCENTRATED AND DILUTED
I DON'T UNDERSTAND MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN IT
BY HOW MUCH OF THE SOLID YOU PUT IN TO THE SOLUTE
IF YOU TASTED THE THE SOLUTION
ONE HAS LESS POWDER AND ONE HAS MORE POWDER
MARNEY I DON'T UNDERSTAND CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN IT
YOU CAN CHANGE IT BY ADDING MORE SPOONFULS OR STIRRING IT UP MORE
I THINK YOU CAN CHANGE IT BY THE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
YOU CAN TELL THE SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHILE YOU HAVE TO WAIT AND HOW HOW MUCH THE SALT IS PUT INTO IT
YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH THAT ONES
THAT'S THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT GRAMS OF
SINCE THE WATER GRAMS I MEAN AMOUNT WAS THE SAME BUT TO THE GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS DIFFERENT
I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE WOULD MORE BECAUSE IT WOULD WEIGH DOWN BECAUSE IT HAS GRAMS SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS GRAMS OF SOLUTE
I PICK IT OUT THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE WAS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE GRAMS MORE THAN ONE ON THE LEFT
BECAUSE ONE HAS GRAMS AND THE OTHER HAS GRAMS AND SO THAT WOULD AFFECT THE WEIGHT
ONE BEAT TWO AND THREE BUT TWO BEAT THE THREE
THE MOST CONCENTRATED ONE WAS ONE SOLUTION ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED WAS SOLUTION THREE
I THINK THAT MOST DILUTED SOLUTION IS THE NUMBER WOLD BE SOLUTION TWO
LIKE CHEESE
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE ARE PUTTING MIXTURES INTO THE CLEAR SHOT TO SEE WHICH ONES IS MORE DENSE AND HOW WE CAN BALANCE THEM WITHOUT MIXING THEM
IT'S NOT DENSE AS THE OTHER OBJECT
IT WILL FLOW AT THE TOP
I THINK SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT AND SOLUTION A JUST PLAIN OF WATER
IT HAVE THINGS IN THEM
JELLYBEAN
THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE IS STACKED ON TOP
WE GET THE LESS DENSE SOLUTION ON TOP THE
WE CAN SEE THAT
WE PUT SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM SOLUTION B ON TOP
IT'S SOLUTION B
MAKE HIGHEST AND SOLUTION B HAS MORE SALT THAN SOLUTION A
BECAUSE IT GOES BLUE GREEN RED
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ABOUT LEVELS OF SATURATION
YOU PUT THE PUT THE SOLID INTO THE WATER AND SHAKE IT AND THEN IT IT BECOMES SATURATED
I NOTICE THAT IT'S WATER
YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER AND THEN SHAKE IT UNTIL IT DISSOLVES
THAT EACH TIME YOU SHAKE IT IT DISSOLVES
THE WATER HAS FIFTY AMOUNT AND AFTER AND TAKE IT WHATEVER IT BECOMES BUT
THAT IT'S EPSOM SALT
THE WATER HAS HAD ENOUGH AND THE EPSOM SALT FINALLY STOPS DISSOLVING
THERE'S THREE SCOOPS
THERE'S SALT SO IT WEIGHS MORE
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXPLOSION
THE BAKING SODA IS REACTING TO THE VINEGAR
THE BAKING SODA BECAUSE THAT
THE CITRIC ACID IS BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
SOLUTE IS SOLVENT
WE MIXED THEM TOGETHER
YES BECAUSE I DID THE EXPERIMENT
BUBBLING AND STUFF
THE VINEGAR HAS MIXED TOGETHER AND SO THIS THE MIDDLE IS JUST ALL WEIGHT
THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS
IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE VINEGARS MOLECLUES MIXED IN THAT WITH THE BAKING SODAS AND FORMED A DIFFERENT KIND OF MOLECLUE
WHEN YOU MIX THAT IT EXPLODES
SOLUTES
BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
THERE'S A PARTICIPANT AT THE WORKS FROM
A PARTICIPANT PARTICIPATE
PARTICIPANT
THERE'LL BE BREAK REACTION TO THIS MIXTURE
THERE IS PURPLE MOLECULES ADDED
RAINING THAT MUCH HERE WE ARE
I DON'T THINK WE CAN'T JUST WE DID DURING THE PRODUCTS IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME
UM THERE WAS A BUBBLE FIZZ AND THAT'S A REACTION SO THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT
IN CARBONATED WATER THERE IS BUBBLES THAT THERE IS AND THEN IT MAKES SLOWED UP
THERE ARE THOSE BUBBLES I LET YOU KNOW THAT'S IN REACTION WITH FORM
I SEE YOU BEND THE GLOW STICK CHEMICALS REACT AND MIX TOGETHER TO FORM A REACTION TO MAKE THE GLOW STICK LIGHT UP
IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT'S A SOLVENT IT'S A SOLUTE IS ALSO A SOLVENT
WE THINK IT HAS BECAUSE OF THE SOLVENT SOLUTE DISSOLVES IN THE SOLUTE SOLVENT
WE'RE DOING STUFF LIKE CONDENSATION AND DILATATION AND NOT A SEPARATE MIXTURES
IF IT'S LEFT DENSE IN THE WATER THEN IT WILL FLOW IN THE WATER
IT WILL FLOAT
SOLUTION A IS A LESS DENSE THAN THE CORK AND SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE THE CORK
IF IT IS MORE CONSTANT TRADED IS MORE DENSE
THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION FLOATS TO THE TOP BECAUSE AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS SINK TO THE BOTTOM
THEY ARE IN LAYERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAME AMOUNT OF DENSITY
THE DENSER SOLUTION SINKS TO THE BOTTOM CREATING A LAYER WITH THE SOLUTION A
WELL IN THE SOLID YOU MIX DIFFERENT ITEMS TOGETHER JUST LIKE IN A MIXTURE
IN THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT EVERYTHING IS MIXED TOGETHER AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT EVERYTHING IS SPREADOUT AND NOT MIXED TOGETHER
THEY ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES INSIDE THIS AND SO THEY ARE BEING SPREAD A PART BUT WHEN YOU MIXED A MALL TOGETHER AND MIXTURE
IT'S SPREADING A PART
THEY ARE SEPARATING BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
THE SCREEN IS MAKING THE WATER GOES THROUGH BUT SINCE THE HOLES IN THE SCREEN ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THE THEY STAND
WELL IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE COFFEE GROUND WITH THE FILTER UM COLLECTS THE SAND WHERE THE WATER WENTS THROUGH INTO THE CUP
IT SEPARATING THE MIXTURE'S MAKING THEM
IT BECOMES A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE SALT EVAPORATES OR DISSOLVES
WATER AND NOT EXACTLY SURE
NO BECAUSE IT HAS DISSOLVES SO WELL ACTUALLY YES BECAUSE THE WATER COULD EVAPORATE WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE GRAPE TASTIC
SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE THE WATER COULD EVAPORATE
THAT THE SOLUTION CANNOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE GRAPE JUICE IS ALREADY DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
LEARNING ABOUT UM SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
WE CALL THEM SOLUTION
THE SOLUTE IS DISSOLVES AND IT IS THE THING THAT DISSOLVE
I AM SORRY THE LIQUID IS THE SOLUTE AND IT IS WOULD DISSOLVES BUT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO
THE SOLVENT IS THE DISSOLVED WITH THE SOLID AND IN THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION IT DISSOLVES
I CANNOT SEE THE PICTURE
THE SALT WATER UM WEIGHT MORE THAN THE PLANE WATER
BY LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE
I THINK THEIR COMPONENTS ARE THE MIXTURE
THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BUT ONLY WATER EVAPORATES SEE THE SOUND TO GET
IT MEANS THAT IS THAT THEIR SOLID SOLVED YOU
YOU CAN ADD A MIXTURE
THIS IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
BY LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE
IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLVED YOU OR SOLUTION
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS ADDED THE MIXTURE
THE SCREEN IS HOLDING THE ROCKS WHAT THE WATER FLOWS TO
THE WATER AND THE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT A SEED IS
THE WATER AND THE ROCKS
WELL MAY BE THE PLANE AND THIS PICTURE IS IS THAT YOU ARE ABLE JUST TO SEPARATE MIX
WE USE MAGNETS FELT THERE IS SCREENS AND UM I THINK THAT'S ALL OH AND SUNLIGHT
SOUND GIVES
I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIP PICKS UP THE UM PAPER CLIPS AND THE PAPER CLIPS ONLY
BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE CAN PICK UP THAT PICK UP INTO A SEPARATE THE MIXTURE USING PAPER CLIP
THAT THE ROCKS WERE THE ONLY THINGS THAT BE THAT COULD BE USED BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE BUT FAST THROUGH HIS RECEIVE
BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE COULD SEPARATED
WELL I NOTICED THAT THE WATER CAN THROUGH CLEAR
BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE COULD HOLD THE STAND SO IS SUCH AS IF WE USED A SCREEN THERE AND THERE WATER FALLS THERE
THE SALT IS THE BEST FOR THE SOLUTE
IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO LET THE WATER OBSERVED INTO THE AIR
THEY SOLUTE
A SOLUTE
THE CUP ON THE LEFT OR THE DARKER CUP UM HAS MORE POWER
THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED AND THEY HAVE MORE SOLUTE
THEY DILUTED
BECAUSE IN EITHER HAS MORE WATER THEN IT DOES POWDER
HAVE YOU'RE OR UM MORE THEARPY OR SOMETIME IS BETTER IF THAT'S YOUR OPINION
IT WOULD TASTE BETTER AND UM STRONGER
WEAKER AND DILUTED
BY WHAT WASTE THE WATER
BY USING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
BY ADDING A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF WATER
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THAT THE ROCK WAYS MORE
HOW IS ALSO THEN WEIGHING DECISIONS AND TO SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THAT UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WITH WEIGH MORE
THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WELL NO WAY AND THE LEFT AND THE DILUTED ONE WILL GO UP
I WAS CORRECT THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE READ MORE THAN THE LAST DILUTED ONE
ONE IS THE MOST
I BELIEVE THAT NUMBER TWO IS THE MOST DILUTE
WELL THIS SALTS STOPS DISSOLVING
IT MEANS THAT YOU'VE MADE A SOLUTE
WE WORKED ON SATURATION AND MIX AND SOLUTION
THE CITRIC ACID STARTS TO UNSATURED AT FOR SCOOP
THE CITRIC ACID IS PROBABLY MORE DENSE THAN THE SUGAR
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUGAR HAS MORE WATER SO IT TAKES LONGER FOR IT TO UNSATURATE
THE SUGAR WASTE THE MOST THE ABSENT SOLVENT WEIGH TO LEAST AND THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE
THEY PROBABLY WILL DISSOLVE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THERE WAY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
SUBSTANCE C IS SUBSTANCE THREE
YOU KNOW THAT IT FELT BECAUSE THEY'RE SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS
THE THINGS ON THIS ON THE TRAY IDENTIFY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
BUBBLING FIZZING MIXTURE
THEY'RE REACTANT
SOLUTES
SOLUTES AND
THE REACTANTS CREATED A PRODUCT THAT FIZZED AND BUBBLED
A I FORGOT
WHEN THE BAKING SODA WAS ADDED IT STARTED BUBBLING AND FIZZING
THEY LOOKED DARKER IN THAT
THEY LOOKED DARKER AND THE VINEGAR AND DARKER THE BAKING SODA BUT WHEN THEY GO INTO THE CUP THEY'RE LIGHTER AND ALL MIXED TOGETHER
THERE IS LESS MOLECULES IN THE PRODUCT
OVER TIME THAT REACTANCE AND THE PRODUCT PRECIPITATE
BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
THERE WAS NO PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY REACTANCE DIDN'T COME TOGETHER IN THE CORRECT WAY
ALL THE DIFFERENT REACTANTS MOLECULES ARE DIFFERENT AND THEN THE PRODUCTS MOLECULES
NO THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHAT YOU REACT A REACTANT CAME TOGETHER AND MADE A PRODUCT IN WHICH CHANGE COLOR
THE PRODUCT CHANGED COLOR
IT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE TWO REACTANCE CAME TOGETHER AND THE PRODUCTS FIZZED AND BUBBLE
BE TWO REACTION THE TWO REACTANTS CAME TOGETHER AND THE PRODUCT REACTED TO THE REACTIVES
I KNEW THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THAT BUBBLE AND IT FIZZ
THAT THEY'RE TRANSPARENT WATER THAT HAS NOT BEEN IN AIR TO WATER THAT HAS AIR
A REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE WATER IT WAS THE SAME AS WHEN IT IN THE BOTTLE AS OUT OF THE BOTTLE
A CLUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A REACTION IS THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE MOLECULES
OVERTIME THINGS CHANGE BECAUSE THE BY CYCLE RESTS OVER THE TIME
WHAT MAKES THE REACTION HAVE BEEN IS THE BAKING SODA AND THE WATER SO THE REACTANTS
WELL THE TORE HELPS YOU IDENTIFY WHAT HAPPENED SINCE IT IS SQUARE AND CLEAR IT MEANS THAT IT SOLVED
WELL THE BAD BAG EXPANDS WHEN YOU ADD THEIR REACTANCE SO THE PRODUCT BLOWS UP THE BAG
THE PRODUCTS YOU SEE HERE AFTER THEY'RE REACTANTS ARE PUT TOGETHER IS THE BAG EXPANDS
SOME REACTANTS ARE GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
WELL WHEN ALL THE REACTANTS ARE PUT TOGETHER IT BUBBLES AND THE AIR EXPANDS THE BAG
IT SHOWS THAT'S ASK YOU ADD THINGS IT WEIGHS MORE
SHOWS THAT THE MASS OF THE PRODUCTS IS BIGGER THAN THE MASS OF THE REACTANTS OR THAT THEY'RE EQUAL
THAT THE REACTANTS AND PRODUCTS HAVE EQUAL MASS
WHEN MY BACK IS CLOSED IT WEIGHS MORE BECAUSE OF THE GAS BUT WHEN THE BAG IS OPEN NO GAS CONFIRM SO IT WEIGHT LOST
THE MASS OF THE BAG CLOSE IS MORE THAN THE MASS WITH THE BAG OPEN
THE MASSES ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE GAS THAT IS GATHERED AND WHEN THE BAG IS CLOSED
GOOD THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU
WHAT I FEAR A CHEMICAL REACTION
IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOLUTIONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT
THESE SYSTEMS ARE ALL PART OF THE BIOSPHERE
I'M LEARNING ABOUT ECOSYSTEMS BIOSPHERES AND ALL SYSTEMS OR SUBSYSTEMS
A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
THIS MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY CAN PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEN THEY ARE ALSO FOOD FOR CONSUMERS
THE PRODUCERS ARE THE PINE CONE AND GRASS
ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING PRODUCERS AND PLANTS
THE CONSUMERS ARE THE SALAMANDER THE BUG THE RABBIT THE BIRD THE SNAKE AND THE HAWK
A DECOMPOSER CONSUMES DEAD ORGANISMS AND THEN REPLANTS THEM INTO THE GROUND
COMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DEAD LIFE FORMS OR ORGANISMS
FUNGI AND BACTERIA ARE BOTH DECOMPOSERS
THIS FOOD WEB IS ALSO MISSING A DECOMPOSER
THESE CONSUMERS ARE PUT INTO FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS HERBIVORES CARNIVORES OMNIVORES DERMIVORES
TALKED ABOUT OMNIVORES CARNIVORES AND HERBIVORES
TO BE AN HERBIVORE YOU ARE AN ORGANISM THAT ONLY EATS PLANTS
TO BE A CARNIVORE YOU MUST ONLY EAT MEAT
TO BE AN OMNIVORE YOU MUST EAT BOTH MEAT AND PLANTS
BEING AN OMNIVORE CONNECTS TO THIS STATEMENT BECAUSE THEY EAT ALL ORGANISMS BOTH PLANT AND MEAT MATERIAL
THIS STATEMENT CONNECTS TO BEING CARNIVORE BECAUSE THESE ANIMALS BOTH EAT ONLY MEAT WHICH IS THE DEFINITION OF BEING AN CARNIVORE
A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT
A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE
IN DECOMPOSER THAT DECOMPOSE OR BREAK DOWN DEAD ORGANISMS
THAT TELLS ME THAT DECOMPOSERS EAT DEAD ANIMALS OR ANIMAL WASTE
BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER
A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE BECAUSE THEY EAT ONLY PLANTS
A FOX IS A CARNIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS ONLY OTHER ORGANISMS
WORMS ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY DECOMPOSE DEAD ORGANISMS OR
THEY BREAK DOWN ANIMAL WASTE OR DEAD ANIMALS
STUDYING DECOMPOSERS CARNIVORES HERBIVORES AND SUBSYSTEMS
THE YEAST USES THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE COOKIE
I BELIEVE THAT THE YEAST IS EATING THE COOKIE OR CONSUMING THE COOKIE
YEAST IS USED IN BREAD
CIRCULAR CELLS ARE A PIECE OF YEAST
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE GRASS AND SEE THAT THE ROOTS ARE UNDER
THIS IS TRYING TO SHOW US THAT BY ADDING WATER AND SUN THIS PLANT WILL GROW
THE PLANTS BASIC NEEDS ARE DIRT WATER AND SUNLIGHT
THIS IS AIR OR OXYGEN THE PLANT NEEDS OXYGEN TO SURVIVE
PLANTS ALSO NEED SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
THE PLANT NEEDS NUTRIENTS OR FOOD
THIS IS LIKE FERTILIZER
THIS IS SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS A HOME OR SHELTER
THE PLANT NEEDS WATER CARBON DIOXIDE ENERGY AND OXYGEN
THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS
PLANT IS DYING BECAUSE IT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE OF ITS BASIC NEEDS SUNLIGHT
IT'S DYING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNLIGHT
PLANT IS DYING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OXYGEN
THIS PLANT IS DEHYDRATING AND IS DYING BECAUSE IT HAS NO WATER
IT SHOWS THAT WHEN A PLANT'S DEPRIVED OF ONE OF ITS BASIC NEEDS IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO SURVIVE
THIS ROCK IS HEALTHY OR THIS PLANT IS HEALTHY AND CLEAN BECAUSE IT HAS ALL OF ITS BASIC NEEDS
BECAUSE IT HAS AIR SUNLIGHT AND WATER ITS BASIC NEEDS
HOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS GOING TO TAKE
THIS BLADE OF GRASS IS A PARALLEL LEAF
THIS IS A PALMATE LEAF OR THE MAPLE LEAF IS A PALMATE LEAF
THE COTTONWOOD LEAF IS A PENNANT LEAF
JUST LIKE PHOTOSYNTHESIS THIS WATER IS BECAUSE OF EVAPORATION
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF DOG AND HUMAN
THIS PICTURE OR IMAGE SHOWS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN WITH THE HEART THE ARTERIES THE VEINS
THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE BODY
THE BLUE PART OF THE ANIMATION ARE THE CELL AND THE BLOOD IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE CAPILLARIES
I THINK THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD TO THE REST OF THE BODY
THE BLOOD VESSELS CARRIED THE BLOOD INTO THE HEART
I BELIEVE THAT IT BE IS AT THE HEART UM THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD THROUGHOUT THE BODY
THE C IS THE BLOOD THAT TRAVELS THROUGHOUT THE BODY INSIDE OF THE BLOOD VESSELS OR C TRAVELS INSIDE LETTER A
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND WHAT THEY ARE
ALL THESE THINGS ON THE SCREEN ARE MIXTURES
THAT THEIR EITHER MIXTURES OR SOLUTIONS
I FORGOT WHAT ARE PROPERTIES
SOLUTIONS
ITS BEEN SEPARATED BY THE
WE ARE SEPARATING THE MIXTURE
THEY ARE BEEN SEPARATED
THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER TO TO CREATE SEPARATION
THEY HAVE BEEN SEPERATED BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
IT DISSOLVES
THE SCREEN IS CREATING SEPARATION
A SLEW
A MIXTURE AND THE SOLUTIONS
IT DISSOLVES WHICH CREATED A SOLUTION
THE ONE THAT IS NOT DISSOLVE
THE SOLVENT IS THE LIQUID WHICH IS THE WATER
THEY ARE MATERIALS MIXED INTO ONE TO CREATE A MIXTURE
THAT THEY ARE TWO MATERIALS COMBINED INTO ONE TO CREATE ONE BIG MATERIAL
THAT THEY ARE CREATED EASILY
THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE
THE MASS IS GETTING MERGER AND MERGER AT AN EACH MATERIAL TO THE MIXTURE
HOW SEQUEL
IT'S JUST LIKE MASS BECAUSE YOU POUR THE MATERIAL TO EQUAL THE
BUT THIS IS A SOLUTION
A MASS OF EACH CREATES ONE BIG MASS WHICH IS LIKE I DID
A FILTER SCREEN AND TO FOUND OUT
THEY SOLUTE IS A LIQUID WHICH IN THIS CASE IT IS WATER THE MIXTURE IS ALLOWED TO OR MORE THINGS MIX TOGETHER TO EQUAL ONE
NOTHING CAN BE FILTERED WHICH YOU MEANS THAT IT GOING THE SAND I MEAN INTO POINT ANOTHER WAY TO CATCH THE SAND
IT IS A MIXTURE
I WILL SAY A SOLUTION
SEPARATED BY EVAPORATING THE
WE COULD EVAPORATE AND
THAT IS DRYING UP AND SALT IS COMING BACK
DAY AND HOURS AND HOW MANY DAYS IT IS AND IT JUST CHANGE IN OVER TIME
BYE
YOU CAN EVAPORATE THEM YOU CAN USE THE FILTER
THE MAGNET IS ALL THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND SEPARATING ONE OF THE MIXTURES
HOW YOU CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES
MAGNETS COLLECT THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN IS MAGNETIC
SEPARATING MIXTURES FROM THE WATER
MAGNETS FILTERS SCREENS AND FUNNELS
SEPARATE TWO SEPARATING TWO
MY FIRST OPTION WAS PAPER CLIPS AND IT DID SEXY
I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW
I NOTICE THAT SCREENS CAN CATCH BIGGER FORMS INSTEAD OF THE SAND AND THE SALT
I THINK WE NOTICE THAT EVERYTHING CAN GO AND EXPECT FOR THE HARDER SHAPED AND NOT THIS NOT THINGS SO
FILTERS ARE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
TO DISINTEGRATE THE WATER AND BRING BACK THE SALT
IT'S SHOWING YOU SEPARATION FROM THE MIXTURE
TO SEPARATE THE ELEMENT OF A MIXTURE
SEPARATING THE ROCKS FROM THE MIXTURE
YES THAT IS YES
GREEN
HENCE
TOOLS FOR SEPARATION
IT BIG THINGS AND NOT GETS THE THINGS SO YOU CAN START SEPARATING
YOU CAN SEPARATE THE MIXTURES BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WHERE THE ONLY THING THAT WAS PICKED UP BY THE MAGNETS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WAS NOT PICKED UP BY THE MAGNET
CHOOSE AT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
THE SCREEN WILL ONLY CATCH THE ROCKS BECAUSE IT DID NOT LET ME PUSH ON ANY OF THE OTHER
TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER AND SAND AND POWDER
BECAUSE THE FILTER IS USEFUL
ONLY TO VANISH THE WATER AND MAKE THIS OUTCOME
EVAPORATING SALT SOLUTION MIXTURES FUNNELS SCREENS MAGNETS AND SEPARATING NOW
I'M GOOD
I HAVE TO LET'S SEE I AM GOING TO BECAUSE I'M WEIRD
AS A SOLUTION IF YOU PLENTY HAVE THEIR
A SOLID AND A MATERIAL AND MATERIAL HAVE TO DISSOLVE IN THE WATER TO MAKE IT SOLUTION
RIGHT THE SOLUTIONS IN THE BOTTLE
THAT THE WATER IS SATURATED
IT IS CALLED SATURIZED FOR THE WATER IS SATURIZED
IT HAS CALLED SATURIZATION
THEY BECOME SATURATED
SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE YOU ADDED MORE SALT AND THE OTHER SALTS NOT HEAVIER
IF YOU ADD BAKING SODA TO THE PRODUCT THEN IT FACES IN BUBBLES
THE BAKING SODA RAISE AND VENIGAR WENT DOWN AND THEN TAKE CREATED A MIXTURE THE PRODUCT THAT BOTH IN PASTE
BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED TOGETHER AND A MIX IT BUBBLE IMPLIES
WE CAN'T CAN WE CAN'T
REACTED REACTANT
THERE ARE CHEMICAL REACTIONS
NUMBER ONE IN THREE ARE GOING TO DISSOLVED AND NUMBER TWO WON'T DISSOLVE THERE IS NO BAKING SODA ANYTHING WITH MIXED WITH BAKING SODA
WANT TO WE HAVE THAT BAKING SODA IT FACES UP AND THEN IT GOES DOWN
THAT IS SOME TOP ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE VINEGAR IS MIDDLE
THAT MEANS THEY ARE DIFFERENT MIXTURES
IS AFTER A FEW DAYS THAT THERE CHEMICAL REACTIONS STOPS
PRECPITATE
PRECPITATE
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME
I DON'T THINK CHEMICAL REACTIONS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE
MOSTLY THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
TWO MIXTURES ARE MIXING TOGETHER TO CREATE A SOLUTION
IT CHANGED THEY CHANGE INTO PINK
IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT HAD A REACTION WITH REACTION STOPPED AND TURNED INTO A PRECPITATE
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE WATER BECUSE THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION IN IT
AFTERNOON START OVER YEAH WHAT THE BIKE RUST IN WITH THE RAIN AND THEY BEG IN THE CHEMICAL REACTION
THOSE ALSO WHEN THEY IT RAINING IS GETTING DRAK BROWNER BECAUSE IT'S RUSTING
THAT'S A GREEN MIXED WITH CHEMICAL REACTION
OH IT HAS A CHEMCICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL WAS INSIDE IT AFTER THEY SHAKEN UP AND THEN DID THEY GROW
THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACCTION AND IF THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION WE WANT TO HAVE GO STICKS
A CHEMICAL REACTION MAKE A EFFORT EACH
THEY ARE ALL SYSTEMS
IT IS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM
I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S KEEPING SOMEONE ALIVE
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE DIGESTIVE
EARTH IS A SYSTEM TO KEEP US ALIVE
I SEE TREES
LIVING THINGS
THIS IS A FOOD CHAIN OR A FOOD FOOD WEB
I'M GOOD I JUST MET WITH YOU ALSO
THE PINEAPPLE THE MUSHROOMS THE BACTERIA AND LIKE NO NO NO SORRY THE PINEAPPLE AND THE GRASS
CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY PRODUCERS
DECOMPOSERS DECOMPOSE THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT HAVE DIED
THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI
I WOULD SAY A PRODUCER
THE ONE THAT IS MISSING IS A DECOMPOSER AND IT IS THE FUNGI
HERBIVORES CARNIVORES OMNIVORES AND DETRIVORES
THESE CONSUMERS ARE CONSUMERS LET'S GET IT STRAIGHT
EAT MEAT
UH IT MEANS YOU EAT FRUIT
THE BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER
I THINK IT IS AND OMNIVORE
IT MAKES OVER AND OVER
CARNIVORE CARNIVORE
THE WORMS ARE DECOMPOSERS THAT'S WHAT IT HAS TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
A DECOMPOSER
THEY BREAK DOWN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
THE ATMOSPHERE GEOSPHERE HYDROSPHERE AND LITHOSPHERE
WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE YEAST
THE LIVING MOLECULES
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BREAK DOWN THE YEAST
BLAH BLAH BLAH
HEALTHY WHEAT GRASS AND SICK WHEAT GRASS
THAT'S AIR GENIUS
THIS IS SUN
THAT IS A HAMBURGER PLANTS CAN'T EAT HAMBURGERS
BECAUSE THEY ARE A SYSTEM
IT'S DYING
IT COULDN'T BREATHE SO IT DIED
BECAUSE IT IS GETTING EQUAL AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT AIR AND WATER
PLANTS MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD STARTS OUT THE FOOD WEB
PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS UHM YEAST CAN BREAK DOWN
HM ABOUT SATURATION
THERE IS MORE SALT BECAUSE IT'S DISSOLVING AND MAKES IT MORE
WELL IF BOTH ARE MILLIGRAMS BUT LET SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
I THINK IT'S A SMALL LIKE GRAINS THE SUBSTANCE
THAT ITS ACTUALLY SALT IS THE EPSOM
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SALT IT WAS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE
SALTS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTAL
I THINK IT'S A CRITIC ACID
YOU GO UP TO THE NEXT ONE
AH MY RECORDS
A PRODUCT
ITS DISSOLVED AND THEN IT WAS COMING IT WENT UP AND THEN IT WAS COMING DOWN
KENT HREACTANT
I DON'T REALLY THINK IT BECAUSE I THEY DIDN'T LOOK WITH THEY DON'T HAVE BUBBLE
WELL ONLY MEANS IT'S WATER I JUST WANT TO SEE IT LIKE ONE TO SEE BUBBLE LIKE DO
THAT IT HAS DIFFERENT COLORS AND
I HAVE NO IDEA
IT MOVES
THERE IT'S BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER
CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND
WELL REALLY I WASN'T HERE FOR THOSE DAYS BECAUSE I WAS ABSENT I WAS
WEILL THE CHEMICALS AND THEY DISSOLVED
THAT THE SUGAR WAS MORE THAN THE CRITIC ACID AND EPSOM SALT
WELL WHAT I THINK IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT CLOSEST RAY IS GOING TO BE CLOSEST TO
WAIT A SECOND SO EPSOM SALT IT THE SUGAR IS STILL WEIGHS MORE
SO IT IS GOING TO BE CHEMICAL REACTION
IT'S ACTUALLY A CHEMICAL REACTION
A CUP IS A PRODUCT THE BIG AND VINEGAR
IT LOOKS THE CRITIC ACID AND BAKING SODA YOU GET CHEMICAL REACTION AND YOU MIX THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE BAKING SODA YOU GET CHEMICAL REACTION TOO
WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS
OH YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS THE SALT IS A LITTLE CLEAR LIKE
UM WELL
WELL LET THEY CLOSE SO THEY COULD KEEP THE CHEMICAL REACTION IN PLACE
THEY ARE MIXING
THEY ARE ADDING THE POWDER AND IT'S MAKING THE CHEMICAL
IT'S MAKING CHEMICAL REACTION
WELL THERE WASN'T A CHEMICAL REACTION IT MAKES NO IT IS FIZZ
THEY EVAPORATED IT
THAT IS NOT CHEMICAL REACTION
I KIND OF RESULT AND THEN IT FIZZLES
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL THEY MIXED OTHER THAT MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION AND THE BACK EXTENDED
WILL BE WAITED THERE
WELL
THAT IT'S
THAT THE ONE THAT WAS CLOSE FIZZLED MORE
GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
I'M FINE MARNI I THINK THAT'S YOUR NAME OR WHAT IS IT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
THEY'RE DIFFERENT BY BECAUSE UHM THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS
YES
ON THE RIGHT IT'S ALL SEPARATE AND ON THE LEFT IT'S NOT SEPARATE
VERY WELL HOW ABOUT YOU
I NOTICE THAT THE ONE I TOUCH IS LIKE A FEATHER WHICH IS THE PENNANT IT LOOKS LIKE A FEATHER
WE GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION
I THINK IT'S A PALMATE LEAF
IS A PALMATE LEAF AGAIN
SO IT UHM ABSORBS THE WATER AND IT EXPELS THE WATER
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THE CO CARBON DIOXIDE
THEY HELP UM OUR WHOLE BODY
THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THEN THE BLOOD
THE BODY HELPS US UM THE HEART HELPS THE BODY FUNCTION
I SEE THAT BLOOD IS COMING IN BLOOD IS GOING OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS ON GOING ON AND ON
HI I AM VERY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
WE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE NOT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM HAS NOSE MOUTH TRACHEA LUNGS BRONCHIA DIAPHRAGM BRONCHIOLE AND ALVEOLA
THE LUNGS HELP US HUMAN'S BREATH
THE BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES ARE THE TWO THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OUT THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
UM WHAT WAS THE QUESTION OF THIS
OH I THINK IT IS
IT TAKES IT IN BY THE BREATH IN BY THE NOSE OR AND EXHALE IT BY THE MOUTH
IT IS LETTER A
I THINK IT IS HDN AND G
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT AIR ON THE BODY SYSTEM
THIS IS THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE BEHAVE AND MEET OTHER
LEARNING ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIORS AND ANIMAL BEHAVIORS
THE UM NO THE
YEAH I AM LOOKING FOR NECTAR TO BRING TO THE TO
IS SHOWING HOW IT IS GETTING IT GOT SCARED FROM THE DING DONG IT GOT SCARED FROM THE DING DONG
THAT IS THE STIMULUS AND BY THE DING DONG
YEAH THAT IS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
LIKE PARTS LIKE IF YOU WANT I AM LIKE SHE WHERE SHE WANTS TO AHEAD IT AND THEN SHE
ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE IS A HUMAN BEHAVIOR
THE SAND AND THE SALT ARE BOTH DISSOLVING WITH THE WATER
THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT IS A SOLUTION
THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE WATER IS A LIQUID AND THE SALT IS A SOLID
SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT IS A MIXTURE
IT GAINS GRAMS EVERY TIME YOU ADD SOMETHING
THE WATER IS GRAMS AND THE SALT IS GRAMS AND WHEN YOU ADD THEM WE GOT GRAMS
WHEN YOU MIX ONE SUBJECT AND ANOTHER SUBJECT TO BECOME THE SOLUTION
AT THE WATER IS GRAMS THE SALT WAS GRAMS AND SALT AND WATER MIX TOGETHER IS GRAMS
THAT WE NEED TO EVAPORATE THE WATER
POUR THE SALT BACK INTO LOOK UP AGAIN
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE MYSTERY SOLUTIONS IN RED GREEN AND BLUE WATER
A SCREEN AND IF FILL
THE MAGNET IS COOLING PAPER CUPS AND PAPER CUPS ARE GOING TO PICK UP IRON
IT'S SEPARATING A MIXTURE
IT TWO THINGS MIX TOGETHER
THE WATER AND THE LITTLE ROCKS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN AT THE BIGGER
THAT THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETTING POLES FROM THE CENTER
IT WILL ATTRACT METAL IRON AND ATTRACTIVE TO METAL
MAGNET SCREENS AND FILTER
BECAUSE FILTERS WOULDN'T REALLY WORK WITH SEPARATE THE LITTLE ROCK TO AND THE MAGNET WON'T REALLY WORK EITHER
BECAUSE USING THE SAME TOOL WOULD BE KIND OF BORING
BECAUSE OF FILTER AND A SCREEN WOULDN'T REALLY WORK
BECAUSE A SCREEN WOULDN'T REALLY WORK
I SEE THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE LITTLE HOLES AND THE FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED
THIS IS IT EVAPORATING THE SALT
UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN USE WATER AND SALT
IT SHOWS THAT THE MORE POWER YOU PUT IN IT AND THE MORE YOU STIR IT THE MORE DARKER IT'LL GET
IF A LIGHTER IF IT'S STRONG
I NOTICED THAT THE MORE POWDER THAT YOU PUT IN IT THE DARKER IT GETS
IF IT'S LIGHTER THAN IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT DARKER IS ISN'T
THAT THE MORE POWDER THAT YOU PUT IN WATER AND STIR IT THE DARKER IT WILL GET
THAT THERE IS LOT MORE POWDER IN THE THAT THE ONE THEN THE ONE THAT IS IS THE
PUT MORE DRINK MIX IN IT AND LESS WATER
THAT THE GRAPE DRINK MIX IS DARK AND THE SALT WATER ISN'T DARKER
WAY THEN FIND THE VOLUME TO ANYTHING
THE SOLUTE IS DIFFERENT
AH THE GRAPE IS IT SHOWS THAT IT CAN BE DARKER AND LIGHTER BUT THE SALT WATER DOESN'T SHOW ANY
ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT'S HEAVIER IT HAS MORE WATER AND IT HAS MORE SOLVENT
ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
THAT THE PENNY IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE CORK IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
THAT THE SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE AND THE SOLUTION B IS LESS
THEY PUT BLUE ON THE BOTTOM AND ORANGE ON TOP AND IT
THE BAKING SODA MADE THE VINEGAR FIZZ
IT MADE A SOLUTION AND STARTED TO BUBBLE
BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR ARE EQUAL SOLUTE
CALCIUM CHLORIDE CITRIC ACID AND BAKING
THE BAKING SODA MADE THE VINEGAR FIZZ UP
THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE BUBBLES ON THEM
BAKING SODA WATER AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
A SATURATED SOLUTION
IT DOESN'T FIZZ UP AND IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING REAL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING REAL
STOP TALKING STOP TALKING WILL YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU STOP TALKING
THE SODIUM AND HYDROXIDE AND SOMETHING IT IS DOES NOT WORKED
YOU STOP CRACKING YOU STOP CRACKING I MISSED THIS SCIENCE LESSON I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENING
IT'S A CRACKING REAL RYAN I'M GOING TO CALL XBOX MICROSOFT IF YOU DON'T STOP RYAN STOP
I NOTICED YOU GET A AFTER YOU VIEW IT
OH IT HICS HICS IT HICS REACTANTS OR HICS
STOP YELLING AT ME WHAT DO YOU WANT MONEY POWER MEN
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING HABITATS RED WORD HABITAT
BECAUSE THEY ALL MOVE IN ALL DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEY ALL WORK IN DIFFERENT WAYS
IT HAS AN ENGINE THAT HELPS THAT HELPS IT MOVE WHEN YOU START
BODY SYSTEM IT'S YOUR IT'S YOUR LIVING SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE
BECAUSE IT MOVES IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IT IS A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE ENGINE AND THE DRIVE
IT HAS LIVING SYSTEMS AND AIR
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATER MOUNTAINS AND THE SKY
THE BIOSPHERE THE HYDROSPHERE THE HEMISPHERE
THE GRASS MOUNTAINS AND
THEY ALL HAVE LIVING SYSTEMS AND REGULAR SYSTEM
THERE'S THE PRODUCERS THE CONSUMERS THEN THE DECOMPOSE
THE PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
BACTERIA AND THE MUSHROOMS
THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGUS
THE SUN AND IT GOES TO THE PRODUCERS AND THE CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THEIR NUTRIENTS
BACTERIA FUNGUS GRASS
OMNIVORE CARNIVORE
YOU'LL ONLY EAT MEAT
THAT YOU ARE A DEAD SOURCE AND YOU GET FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THEY'RE A PRODUCE BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR ENERGY TO CONSUMER
OMNIVORES
OMNIVORE SLASH CONSUMER
LEBRON JAMES LEBRON JAMES
THAT THEY ARE IT CONSUMERS DECOMPOSERS DETRIVORES OR OMNIVORES
BY LEBRON JAMES
WHEN WHEN THINGS LIKE COOKIES GET WET THEY DISINTEGRATE AND
IT IS A
BECAUSE ONE OF THEM BEING WATERED AND PUT IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ISN'T
TRYING TO SHOW US HOW TO HELP IT GROW HOW TO HELP GROW
THEY ALSO NEED THE WIND AND THAT LITTLE CLOUD WITH THINGS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH IS A CLOUD
THIS ONE SHOW THAT IT GOT WATER CLOUDS AIR AND NOT THE SUN SO IT
WITHOUT HAVING SUN IT WILL KILL IT AND AS YOU SEE IT KILLED IT
IT DIDN'T GET THE AIR SO IT UHM CRUNCHED UP AND DIED LIKE THE OTHER
GOT EVERYTHING BUT WATER SO IT DIED
IT GOT EVERYTHING SO IT GREW CORRECTLY AND IT IS A UHM HEALTHY PLANT AND IT GOT ITS NUTRIENT
PRODUCERS WE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT PRODUCERS
PENNANT PALMATE AND PARALLEL LEAVES
IT CAME FROM THE LEAVES FROM EVAPORATION IT JUST CAME OFF OF IF FROM EVAPORATION ON THE
THIS IS A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IN
THE HEART IS SMALLER AND THERE'S MORE TO THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IN A HUMAN THAN THERE IS IN A
H TWO O BACTERIA AND OXYGEN
SHOWING INSIDE THE VEINS WHERE ALL THE BLOOD WHERE ALL
THE HEART BLOOD VESSELS BLOOD VEINS AND
IT BLOWS BLOOD THROUGH YOUR BODY
IT SHOWS THE BLOOD AND THE OXYGEN C O TWO FLOWING THROUGH THE ARTERIES
THEY ARE FLOWING BLOOD
IT'S FLOWING THE BLOOD TO AND FROM THE HEART
THE HEART IS PUMPING THE BLOOD THROUGH THE
IT IS THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF THE HEART
BLOOD VESSELS UHM THEY FLOW THE BLOOD THEY'RE THE ONES THAT FLOW THE BLOOD THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD
GREAT HOW ABOUT YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS YES
THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE
THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
THAT THE SAND IS NOT EVAPORATING AND THE SALT EVAPORATED
IT'S PLAIN A SOLVENT
IT'S CALLED GRAPETASTIC
SALT SALT SALT
ALL OF THE AH SOLUTIONS ARE MIXED TOGETHER IN THE JAR MIX
YOU HAVE TO ADD THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE MIXING TOGETHER TO SEE HOW MUCH GRAMS OR MILLIGRAMS YOU GET
YOU JUST ADD ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN PUT IN TO GET THE GRAMS OR MASS
MASS IS GOING TO GO AWAY
EACH THING IS BEING ADDED
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCREEN SO YOU PUT THE SCREEN OVER A CUP ANOTHER CUP AND YOU POURED ON IT OR IT WILL DROP ON THERE
THAT THE FLOUR IS BEING CAUGHT INTO THE FILTER AND THE WATER'S GOING UNDER
IT'S A PROPERTY OF A MIXTURE
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IT IS A LIQUID THING AND IF YOU TRY TO IT'S JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING ON UNDER IN FALLING INTO THE CUP
THE EPSOM SALT IS EVAPORATING
THE ACID IS EVAPORATING INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S NOT CATCH IN THE FILTER
WE USE A FILTER OR SCREEN
SALT EVAPORATED BUT WHEN YOU LET IT STAY OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS IT WILL COME BACK
IF YOU LET IT SET OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS IT'LL COME BACK
YOU CAN LET IT SIT OUT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND YOU'LL SEE THE SALT COMING BACK
THE SALT IS COMING BACK
THE TIME IT TAKES
YOU'RE ANNOYING AND I DON'T LIKE YOU BYE
GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
IT'S WHEN TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
WE CAN USE A FILTER OR WE CAN USE LIKE IT'S CATCHER
THAT ALL THE IRON IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
THE SOLUTION IS SEPARATE
THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION
THAT THE ROCKS ARE SEPARATING FROM THE SAND
NO THIS WAS A SOLUTION
THAT YOU ARE AH TAKING THE PAPERCLIPS AWAY FROM THE SAND SO SO YOU'RE COLLECTING ALL THE IRON
THAT UM THE IRON IS STICKING
THE SOLUTIONS AND SHH MIXTURES
THE THE PAPER CLIPS AND THE WOOD
WAS THE ROCKS BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER PIECE SO YES
BECAUSE USING THE FILTER WITH CATCH ALL THE ROCKS
IT'S THE SAND BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER ROCKS AND THE FILTER COULD ONLY CATCH SMALL THINGS
WE CAN CATCH THE SMALL ROCK
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS JUST LIKE LAST WEEK
I DON'T LIKE THIS I DON'T LIKE THIS I HATE YOU BYE BYE YOU'RE
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
YOU CAN MAKE MIXTURE BY PUTTING IN TWO OR MORE THINGS IN TO THERE
LEARNING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
A SOLUTION IS WHERE UM YOU IT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
GRAPETASTIC FRUIT JUICE
CALLED IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT DISSOLVES
THAT ONE HAS FIVE PARTICLES OF GRAPE JUICE IN THE OTHER ONLY AS TWO
YES BECAUSE ONE IS DARKER AND ONE IS LIGHTER SO THE DARKER ONE WILL BE MORE CONCENTRATED
HOW MUCH PARTICLES ARE IN THE WATER
BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE HOW DARK THEY'RE GETTING AND HOW LIGHT THEY'RE GETTING
IT WILL TASTE LIKE WATER BECAUSE UM
YOU CAN ADD LESS WATER OR ADD MORE WATER
YOU COULD LESS WATER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE POWDER
WE'RE DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU GOOD ONE MINUTE AND I NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK WITH
I'M DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND A MIXTURES TO THE MORE THING MIXED TOGETHER AND A SOLUTION IS WHERE SOMETHING DISSOLVES INTO LIQUID
BOTH OF THOSE ARE SOLUTIONS BECAUSE GRAPE MIX DISSOLVES JUST LIKE THE SALT
THEY ARE IN THE UM LIKE HOW TASTY
YES YES YES SIMON SIMON YES
THAT THY BOTH SOLUTION
THE ROCK IS GRAMS IN THE FEATHERS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN FEATHER
YOU CAN WEIGH WATER AND YOU CAN SEE WHICH ONE IS CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE CONCENTRATED ONE IS HEAVIER
THAT THE ONE WITH GRAMS IS GOING TO BE HEAVIER
THAT THE ONE WAS A GRAMS WOULD BE HEAVIER
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDED MORE SALT IN ONE BUT IN THE OTHER ONE YOU DIDN'T ADD THAT MUCH SALT
THAT YOU CAN TELL WHICH ONCE UM MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE ONE MORE CONCENTRATED IS THE HIGHEST ONE
ONE IS A MORE CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS LESS CONCENTRATED
ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED TWO IS LESS CONCENTRATED
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AND THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
SINK TO THE BOTTOM IT WILL SINK
IT'LL STAY UP ON TOP OF THE WATER BECAUSE IT'S LESS DENSE
THERE ARE SOLUTION A'S FIVE GRAMS IS MORE DENSE IN WATER BUT SOLUTION B'S FIVE GRAMS IS LESS DENSE IN THE WATER
SOLUTION B HAS MORE WATER THAN SOLUTION
IN SOLUTION A IT WILL SINK BUT SOLUTION B IT'LL STAY
THAT IT WILL SINK MAYBE BECAUSE IT COULD BE MORE DENSE
THAT EITHER HAS MORE SALT OR WATER IN IT TO MAKE IT MORE DENSE
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY IN ONE TUBE AND DO NOT MIX
THAT THE LESS DENSE SIT ON TOP OF THE MORE DENSE
THAT YOU PUT THE LESS DENSE ON TOP OF THE MORE DENSE SO THEY MIX TOGETHER TO GET RED
BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT IT WON'T REALLY MAKES SENSE IT WILL JUST MIX
PUT SOLUTION A ON TOP SOLUTION B TO MAKE A MIX TOGETHER
THAT THEY'RE ALL SEPARATED
LATER I HATE YOU
LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THAT YOU CAN MIX ALL OF THEM OR TWO OF THEM IN ONE TO MAKE SOMETHING A MIXTURE
THAT YOU CAN PUT IT IN SCOOPS SATURATED
STAY AWAY YEAH COMING THERE TO BEAT ONE
THAT YOU ADD
TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS AND YOU CAN ADD TO MORE TOGETHER OR SOMETHING
NOTHING BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART AND I'M NOT
OF IT THE SHAPE OF IT THE SHAPE OF IT IT SO IT'S REGULAR SALT SO
MY LEGS HURT AND I FEELING REALLY
THAT IT REACTED TO WE NEED BAKING SODA FIZZED AND GOT UP WHEN VINEGAR GOT IN IT YOU SAWT THOSE
PRODUCT PRODUCT
THEY ARE ALL CHEMICALS
THEY ALL GOT A MADE TO PRODUCT
YES BECAUSE AH THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THEIR PRODUCTS SO
DIRT
THEY'RE BOTH TWO DIFFERENT CHEMICALS
THEY BOTH TWO DIFFERENT MOLECULE
TWO DIFFERENT MOLECULE MIXTURES
THAT IT STAYS WHEN YOU LET IS SIT OUT IT BECOMES PRODUCT AND IT SETTLES DOWN
CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA
CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA
THAT TWO OF THE PARTICLES CHANGED IN THE WATER BECAUSE BOTH OF THE PARTICLES MIXED
WATER CHANGED COLOR
WATER HAS GOTTEN COLD BECAUSE OF THE ICE CUBE HOW FREEZING THEY ARE
THE WATER GOT COLD TO MAKE THE WATER SWEAT
THAT THE WATER RISING UP AND THE DRINK IS GETTING COLD AND SWEATY
CHANGE COLOR OR USUALLY
YES BECAUSE THE WATER CHANGE COLOR
IT BECAME IRRATIONAL BECAUSE IT WAS FOAMING AND THEN IT CALMED DOWN
THAT IT'S LIKE SODA BECAUSE IT'S FIZZY BECAUSE CARBONATED WATER IS LIKE SODA BUT WITHOUT TASTE
THAT IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE SOMEONE LEFT IT OUT
BLAH
THAT THE WATER CHANGED GREEN IT'S AN ALIEN WATER
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER CHANGE COLOR SO IT'S ALIEN AND IT IS
THAT IT USUALLY FORMS TO CHANGE COLORS
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS AND WORMS AND WHEAT
SOIL IS MADE OF COMPOST
A POTATO
A POTATO HUMUS GRAVEL GRAIN AND SLIT
LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS
POTATO
POTATO FLEW AROUND MY ROOM BEFORE YOU CAME PEAR
THAT CARS MADE OF DIFFERENT PARTS
CAUSE WE'RE MADE OUT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THE HEART AND THE
BECAUSE THERE'S LITTLE SYSTEMS THAT REFLECT ON IT SO AND IT HAS A LOT OF SYSTEMS TO IT SO YEAH
THEY HAVE SYSTEM
THEY ALL HAVE SYSTEMS TO THEM AND LIKE HOW THEY'RE MADE
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS TWO SYSTEMS IN OUR BODY
THAT YOU USUALLY HAVE THREE SYSTEMS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THE CAR BATTERIES
THAT THE CAR HAS A LOT OF SYSTEMS
THAT IT THE UNIVERSE HAS A LOT OF SYSTEMS AND THE EARTH IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE SYSTEMS MAYBE
THAT THEY ALL HAVE SYSTEMS
THAT THERE'S THREE SYSTEMS THERE'S THE THE BIOSPHERE AND THE HYDROSPHERE
THEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE A SYSTEM
SHOWING THAT WHAT EATS WHAT
BUT THEY ALL ARE EITHER SYSTEMS OR NOT
THEY RELATE BY SYSTEMS AND FOOD WEBS AND FOOD CHAINS
UH
THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS FOOD LIKE A BOSS
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BASS
THEY GET IT FROM PLANTS
UHM THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
UHM PRODUCER
A DECOMPOSER
A DECOMPOSER
FOOD EATERS
THE HUNT WHAT'S RIGHT BY THEM MAYBE KIND OF MAYBE MAYBE
THEY ONLY EAT PLANTS
THEY ONLY EAT PLANTS
THEY EAT PLANTS
MEAT AND PLANTS MAYBE
THEY ALL ARE LIKE A ANIMAL OR A TYPE OF PLANT THAT'S NOT MADE FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS
IT IS A MEAT EATER
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOU SAID
THEY'RE WORMS THEY'RE RED WORMS WE'RE INVESTIGATING ON THEM ACTUALLY THAT'S A COOL STORY
I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO CLUE
IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A COMPOSER
THAT IT FEEDS THE YEAST
DOING VERY GOOD TODAY HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY
IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ALMOST
I SEE A HEART VEIN AND ARTERY
BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND BODY SYSTEMS
IT'S A SYSTEM
HEART ARTERY AND VEIN
THERE'S THE BLOOD HEART CAPILLARY AND CELLS TO THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
OXYGEN AND C O TWO
THE BLOOD GOING THROUGH IT AND THEN GOING THROUGH THE ARTERIES SLASH VEINS
TRAVEL THE BLOOD CELLS THROUGH THE BODY TO GET TO THE HEART
DOWN HERE
THE CIRCULATORY AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
THAT IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM TO HELP YOU BREATHE DUH
UHM
THINK ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HOW PEOPLE REACT TO SOMETHING
THE BEE IS SHOWING THE OTHER BEES WHERE TO GO FIND THE
THAT THE WEASEL GOT SCARED OF THE SNAKE SO THE WEASEL RAN AWAY BECAUSE THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS RATTLING IT'S RATTLE
THE HAND SLAPPED THE MOSQUITO
HE WAS SCARED SO HE HAD TO REACT TO
THE BOY IN THE BLUE SPILL HIS DRINK ALL OVER
THAT IS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM
THE NERVES THE SPINAL CORD AND THE BRAIN ARE ALL PARTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
IT SEND MESSAGES TO YOUR BODY
BODY WHAT TO DO SO IT TELLS THE GIRL TO HIT THE BASEBALL AND TRY TO HIT IT VERY FAR
THIS ANIMATION SHOWS THE BRAIN TO SEND THE MESSAGES
WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING CIRCUIT
ENERGY ENERGY
THE WICK AND THE WAX
SOMETIMES IT SOMETIMES IT LIKE FLICKERS AND YOU HEAR LIKE SPARKS GOING OFF AND THEN ALSO SOMETIMES NO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE
IT'S IT IS GIVING OFF HEAT AND LIGHT AND ALSO IT'S BURNING THE CANDLE WICK AND THE
BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING UP THE MOUNTAIN AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
YOU ARE MAKING SOUND AND IT'S BY
THE FOOD THAT SHE'S THE APPLE THAT SHE'S
I SEE WOOD A GAS CAN APPLES AND A
IT UM IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND WE WILL BE BREATHING IN SMOG WHICH IS BAD FOR OUR
BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND THEN DISTRIBUTE IT INTO
BECAUSE THAT ONCE YOU USE THEM THEY CAN'T BE MADE AGAIN FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS AT A
ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF UM BECAUSE IF YOU BURN COAL AND GAS THEY BOTH COLLECT THEY BOTH US REALLY
SOME CAN BE RENEWABLE SOME ARE FOSSIL FUELS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T BE RENEWABLE VERY EASILY
AN IRON RIVET
THE IT SAYS WASHERS
IT PICKS UP MORE WASHER
I THINK IT WOULD PICK UP THIRTY
YOU SEE COLOR
THEY'RE BOUNCING OFF EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOUCH
COLORS YOU SEE COLORS
LIKE MOSTLY THE MIRROR AND THE AND THE GLASS
THE GUY THE GUY SEES HIMSELF IN COLOR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BEHIND HIM IS
IT UH IT APPEARS LIKE THE UM LIKE THE LIKE IT'S LIKE SLICED IN HALF
WE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE COLORS OF THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT SPECTRUM
THEY ALL GIVE OFF A UM WHITE AURA AROUND AROUND THE LIGHT SOURCE
IT SHOULD GIVE OFF WHITE LIGHT
I SEE THAT WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES FULLY THROUGH THE PRISM IT BECOMES A
IT BECOMES A RAINBOW BECAUSE THE PRISM DIVIDES THE WHITE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS RAIN
IT'S A DIFFERENT COLOR AND AND THE LIGHT AND THE LIGHT WAVES ARE LONG
IT'S GONNA STAY DARKER
BECAUSE IT IT REFLECTS GREEN
THEY ARE MAGNETS
A A STEEL NAIL
WE WE WOULD JUST ADD A LOT MORE WIRE
IF YOU ADD IF YOU ADD TEN IT ADDS MORE WIRES
THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS STRONGER
GET STRONGER
ADD MORE WIRES
IT GETS MORE
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT TRAVELS
LIGHT IS SHINING INTO THE EYE
IT FOR COLOR
THE GUY IN THE WHEEL CHAIR IS TURNING OFF THE LIGHT AND ON THE LIGHT
SO THEY KNOW WHAT COLOR THEY ARE
EYE EYE
LIGHT TRAVELS TRAVELS TO THE HUMAN EYE
THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF OF THINGS
IT REFLECTS IT
LIGHT REFLECTS OFF OF THE THING
REFLECTION
THERE'S A MIRROR
IT HITS YOU IN THE MIRROR THEN HITS THE STAR
THEY'RE THE REFLECTION OF IT
ONE HAS WATER
THAT IT TURNS GREEN RED AND WHITE
WHITE WHITE LIGHT WHITE
WHITE LIGHT YELLOW LIGHT AND ORANGE LIGHT
A LIGHT REFLECTING ON A PRISM IS FROM THE RAINBOW
WHEN THE WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES ON THE PRISM IT SHOWS THE RAINBOW
A RAINBOW
THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BALL
THE LIGHT WILL
WHITE LIGHT IS IS
IT REFLECTS
GOOD HOW BOUT YOU
THE WIRE IS SPECIFICALLY WRAPPED AROUND THE IRON RIVET
FOR YOUR ELECTROMAGNET TO WORK YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC CURRENT GOING THROUGH THE WIRES
YOU COULD WRAP MORE COILS OF WIRE AROUND THE AROUND THE RIVET
THE MORE TIMES YOU WIND THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE RIVET OR THE ELECTROMAGNET WILL
THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP THE THE STRONGER YOUR ELECTROMAGNET
WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BATTERIES THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE
TIMES YOU WIND THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE RIVET WILL GET
WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU GET MOST OF YOUR WASHERS PICKED UP
WORDS ARE THE SIDES THE BOTTOM OF YOUR GRAPH ARE THE UNIT
WHEN THE NUMBER OF WIRE WRAPS INCREASES THE STRONGER THE ELECTROMAGNET GETS
I'M DONE I'M DONE
GRAPHS ARE IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT YOUR DATA AND MAKE AND MAKE PREDICTIONS FROM YOUR DATA
THE MORE YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU WILL PICK PICK UP
THE MORE THE THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE THE MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK
WHEN LIGHT HITS THE EYE YOU CAN SEE THING
THIS MAN IN THE WHEEL CHAIR IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT
LIGHT SHOWS THE COLORS OF THE LIGHT SHOWS THE COLOR OF AN
WHEN I HOVER WHEN I HOVER OVER DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE ROOM I SEE THAT LIGHT BOUNCES OFF OF THE
IT BOUNCE OFF THE OBJECTS THAT ARE IN THE
LIGHT TRAVELS BACK TOWARD THE PERSON'S EYE THE PERSON CAN SEE THE COLORS OF THE OBJECTS
THE LIGHT IS TRAVELING FROM MIRROR TO MIRROR
THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF OF THE MIRROR INTO HIS INTO HIS EYES SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF IN THE
THE LIGHT WILL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN
WHEN THE PENCIL WAS LOWERED INTO THE WATER IT LOOKS LIKE THE PENCIL WAS CUT IN HALF
I'M DOING JUST FINE
THEY ALL PRODUCE ENERGY
LIGHT BULBS AND WELL IT CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE AS LONG
THIS IS A PRISM SPLITTING ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF LIGHT
WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PRISM I SEE A RAINBOW
THE YELLOW BALL IS ABSORBING ALL ALL THE COLORS EXCEPT YELLOW
ALL OF THE LIGHT COLORS ARE ARE ABSORBED BY THE YELLOW BALL EXCEPT YELLOW LIGHT
THE SAME COLOR AS THE OBJECT
WHEN YOU SHINE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE GREEN LIME THE GREEN LIME WILL REFLECT THE LIGHT OR ABSORB THE LIGHT
BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ALL OF THE GREEN LIGHT OK
HOW TO MAKE UH AN ELECTROMAGNET
THEY'RE MAGNETS THAT ARE POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
IT MAKES THE ELECTROMAGNET WORK
WHEN YOU POWER IT WITH ELECTRICITY IT WILL PICK UP THINGS THAT WILL ATTACH TO REAL MAGNETS
MEANS THAT IT'S A MAGNET POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
IT HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD
THAT IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT CLOSED
THAT IT FLOWS IN A CLOSED PATH
IT'LL PICK UP THE WASHERS
THAT IT'LL I DON'T KNOW WHY
HAS TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE A CONDUCTOR TO A MAGNET
BECAUSE STEEL IS A CONDUCTOR TO A MAGNET AND THE RIVET IS MADE OF STEEL STEEL
HOW MANY UHM HOW MANY WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP
LIFTING THE WASHERS
THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
IT WILL PICK UP WASHERS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO PICK UP
THEY WORK TOGETHER BY SENDING A MATCH THE MAGNET
SO THE BATTERY BRINGS THE ENERGY THROUGH AND THEN COMES THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN BACK THROUGH SO IT'S LIKE A CHAIN
THE ELECTRICITY PASSES TO GET PASSES LIKE A LIKE A TRAIN AND THEN IT GOES OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YEAH
IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GO THROUGH AND DOESN'T PICK UP AND WIRE ANY WASHERS BUT IF IT'S OPEN IT WON'T BUT IF IT'S CLOSED IT WILL
WELL IT'S LIKE A MAGNET IT COMES THROUGH THE SWITCH
UP WASHERS WHEN THE UHM SWITCH IS CLOSED LADY
IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WIRES I MEAN ANY WASHERS AND THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S OPEN IT WON'T LET ANYTHING PASS BY
I'M SEEING THE LITTLE RED DOTS ON THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH IT LOOKS LIKE ELECTRICITY
THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSED
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH
I LEARNED MAGNET MAGNET
WELL IF YOU DON'T USE THE STRAW FOR NOT THE SWITCH IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY NOT WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OUT OF STEEL
OH I'M GOOD WHAT ABOUT YOU
ELECTRICITY
IT'S A PARALLEL PARALLEL AH
UH I DON'T KNOW
IT'S GOING THROUGH OVER AND OVER OVER THROUGH D CELL INTO THE MOTOR TO THE LIGHT BULBS I DON'T
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING WAIT ACTUALLY IT IS
IT IS GOING BY WHAT IS A CIRCUIT CALLED
THE ONE ON THE TOP LIGHTS MORE
THE TOP ONES LIGHT MORE BUT THE ONE THAT ONLY HAS ONE LIGHT BULB IT LIGHTS EVEN
IT WILL OBVIOUSLY GET MORE MORE MORE DARKER MORE LIKE MORE LIGHT MORE
IT THINK IT WILL JUST KEEP ON GOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER BUT IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS IT WILL LIGHT EVEN MORE
I DON'T KNOW I REALLY DON'T
IT GOES THROUGH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER
UHM WELL UHM IT GOES THROUGH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND
THE ONE THAT'S NOT PARALLEL IT LIGHTS EVEN MORE IT'S GOING TO STAY LONGER IT'S YEAH
THEY'RE THEY'RE ORGANIZED DIFFERENT
UHM HOW SOME SOME OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
LIKE TWENTY TIMES
UHM THEY'RE ALL WHITE LIGHT
ALL OF THE
YEAH THE SUN A CANDLE AND A LIGHT BULB
THE WHITE LIGHT IS ENTERING THE PRISM AND IT'S BEING SEPARATED INTO COLORED LIGHT
IT GETS SEPARATED INTO COLOR
THEY'RE ALL THE COLORS OF THE
UHM THE WHITE LIGHT IS HITTING THE THE BALL AND BLUE LIGHT IS COMING OFF OF IT
THE RAY HITTING THE BALL IS WHITE AND THE RAY HITTING COMING OFF OF THE BALL IS BLUE
IT REFLECTS OFF BLUE
SAME THING AS THE JUST THE LIGHT COMING OFF IS YELLOW
I ALREADY TOLD YOU THIS
IT FILTERS OUT ALL THE OTHER COLORS EXCEPT THE RED FROM THE WHITE LIGHT
IF IT'S BLUE IT LOOKS BLACK IF IT'S WHITE IT LOOKS
THE COLOR WOULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN IT ACTUALLY IS
IT LOOKS DARKER AND ALMOST BLACK
IT WILL NOT APPEAR GREEN
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT COLOR REFLECTING OFF OF IT
THAT IS THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT
THE SAME THING AS THE GREEN LIME
THEY ARE BATTERIES A LIGHT AND CIRCUITS AND WIRES
CIRCUITS ARE WHAT MAKES THE LIGHT GLOW WHEN YOU ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH IT
THEY HELP YOU THE POWER TRAVEL TO THE MACHINE OR THE LIGHT BULB
THE THE RED SIDE
GOES TOWARDS THE NEGATIVE SIDE
NOW IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY BUT IT'S DOING THE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SAME CYCLE BUT THE OPPOSITE WAY
IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT CAN'T BOTH GO THROUGH THERE
OKAY
UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING TO PUT THINGS TO THE ELECTRIC POINT TO MAKE THE THINGS
WE PUT METAL INTO THE MACHINE AND THEN IT
THE THING'S SPINNING
UH WHY AREN'T YOU DOING OKAY UM THEY'RE CONNECTED TO A BATTERY
IT IS SPINNING
IT IS NOT WORKING WELL YEAH WHAT DO YOU
UM UM SO THE THING IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL TO THE WIRE THE METAL IS GOING
CLOSED
THEY'RE MADE OUT OF METAL
IT IS BURNING
IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS TOO MUCH ENERGY AND IT MADE MY HAND TOO HOT
THE WAX STARTS GETTING GOOEY AND THE THING ON THE TOP STARTS BURNING DOWN
THE THE WAX THE CANDLE WAX IS GOING DOWN TURNING INTO LIQUID
IT SORT OF SOUNDED LIKE FIRE
THE ENERGY IS GOING DOWN WITH THE CANDLE
OH SO I OBSERVE THAT THAT THE DRUMS ARE PLAYING
I CAN HEAR I CAN I CAN HEAR THE DRUMS PLAYING AND GOING
BYE BYE I HAVE TO GO
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CANDLE AND ENERGY
WITHOUT THE ENERGY IT WOULDN'T WORK THE THING THAT'S TRYING TO BE POWERED
AND THEN THE FUEL
I SEE THE FUEL OF THE CANDLE WAX LIGHTING THE FIRE FOR THE CANDLE
YOU CAN HEAR THE CRACKLE OF THE FIRE
THE THE FLAME IS GOING SIDE TO SIDE
THE HANDS ARE HITTING IT WITH THE HANDS ARE HITTING THE DRUMS TO MAKE IT MAKE
SHE IS MOVING UP A MOUNTAIN I'M NOT SURE WHICH IT COULD BE MOUNT EVEREST BUT SHE IS
I CAN HEAR THE DRUMS BEING MAKING THE HANDS GOING ON THE DRUM TO MAKE SOUND TO MAKE A LOT OF SOUND
A FUEL IS THAT SHE'S EATING THE APPLE
EATING THE APPLE EATING THE APPLE
SMOKE LOTS AND LOTS OF POLLUTE SMOKE
I DON'T KNOW
THEY THEY ALL COME FROM NATURAL RESOURCES NOT FROM POLLUTE RESOURCES
ONE'S MADE FROM SUN AND ONE IS WITH WITH WIND
THEY BOTH POLLUTE
YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONE TIME YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONE TIME
COAL FUEL
SEE YA LATER
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AREA CIRCUITS
IT'S INSIDE A LIGHT WELL IT'S IT TAKES THE D CELL AND THEN GOES INTO THE BATTERY
WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND THEN THAT'S WHERE THE ENERGY'S FLOWING IN THE CIRCUIT
IT MAKES ME THINK THAT THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY GOING THROUGH ALL THE ALL THE
IT TELLS ME THAT UM ALL THE
THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS
IT IS VERY DIM
IT WILL LIGHT UP
IT GOT LIGHTER IT KEPT GETTING IT GOT LIGHTER IT ALMOST DOUBLED HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAD
IT ISN'T GOING THE SAME IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY
IF THEY GO THE OPPOSITE WAYS THE ENERGY WILL FLOW
YOU JUST NEED TO ADD MAKE THEM GO THE BATTERIES GO OPPOSITE WAYS
SEE YA LATER HOPE YOU LEARN MORE MATH
GOOD GOOD
A NAIL NOT AN ALUMINUM BUT A NAIL WITH IRON
IF THE BATTERY
THAT IT PICKS UP MAYBE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK EM UP FROM FARTHER DISTANCES
I NOTICED THAT THE MORE WINDS IT THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP
WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER BATTERY IT PICKS UP A LOT MORE
YOU TWIST THE WINDS MORE AND MORE YOU AND THEN YOU'LL GET EVEN MORE WASH
UH WELL BY THE NUMBER OF WINDS AND HOW MANY WASHERS IT PICKS UP
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ORGANISMS
IT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE A CAR SYSTEM
IT'S IT'S A SYSTEM IT'S A SYSTEM CAN YOU HEAR ME IT'S A SYSTEM
I THINK IT IT IT HAS TO DO WITH A CAR SYSTEM AND TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE
I THINK IT HELPS THE CAR MOVE AND WORK
IT HAS IT'S A IT'S A SYSTEM INSIDE THE AN ORGANISM
I SEE EITHER ORGANISM
I KNOW I THINK
ME IT TELLS IT IT IT SHOWS ME ALL THE SYSTEMS IN THE HUMAN BODY
I CAN SEE THAT UM
MOUNTAIN A PART OF
THE OCEAN
LAND I THINK IT'S MADE OF LAND LAND I THINK IT'S MADE OF LAND
THE BIOSPHERE THE GEOSPHERE THE AND THE OTHER SPHERES
THEY ALL IF THEY
AN THEY'RE THEY'RE THE FOOD CHAIN
UM BYE
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND LIVING ORGANISM
UM A CAR SYSTEM I THINK THAT THINKS SO
BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM
SINCE THERE'S THE WORKING PART
I THINK THEY HELP THE CAR MOVE AND THE SYSTEM WORK
THE BLOOD PUMPING SYSTEM
IT TELLS ME THAT
I THINK THIS IS THE BIOSPHERE
I THINK SINCE EARTH HAS A LOT OF SYSTEMS
YES BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE'S IS THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE BIOSPHERE LIKE
THEY ALL HELP EACH OTHER WORK AND MAKE LIFE
ALL OF OUR ONE WHOLE SYSTEM
ALL THE SYSTEMS
THE DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS
I THINK THEY ALL HAVE TO THEY ALL HELP THE LIVING UH ANIMALS
DIRT AND ANIMALS
IT SHOWS YOU THE FOOD WEB
WHICH EATS WHAT WHAT THEY ALL WHAT ANIMALS EAT
THEY TELL WHAT LIVING ORGANISM AND WHERE THEY COME FROM
ABOUT LIVING ORGANISMS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ONE POINT THREE IS ABOUT THAT
IT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FOOD WEB
IT HAS TO DO WITH BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING THE DOMINANT PREDATORS HOW THEY DESTROY THEM
CONSUMERS DECOMPOSERS AND PRODUCERS DO IT
IT MEANS THAT THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD AND AND MAKE ENERGY
CAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO OTHER ANIMALS EAT IT
MEANS THAT A CONSUMER IS WHAT EATS WHAT THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE
FROM THE THINGS PRODUCERS PRODUCE FROM THE THINGS PRODUCERS PRODUCE
THEY CAN SO THEY CAN KEEP SO THEY CAN GET RID OF THE DEAD ANIMALS AND THEN HELP START OVER THE PROCESS AGAIN
THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI
THINK THIS IS A FOOD WEB AND IT'S SHOWING HOW WHAT ORDER THEY DO TAKE GET KILLED
MEAN THAT YOU ONLY EAT GRASS
BECAUSE
IT MEANS YOU EAT OTHER ANIMALS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
IT IT MEANS YOU EAT FRUITS
HI GOOD
THE COOKIE WAS FOR FOOD THE WATER WAS FOR DRINKING AND THEN THE YEAST WAS FOR LIVING
THEY'RE LIVING ORGANISMS
I SEE I SEE THEY'RE ONE CELLED ORGANISMS
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHEAT
THE YELLOW WHEAT IS THE ONE THAT'S GROWING BEEN GROWING IN THE DARK AND THEN THE GREEN ONE'S WAS GROWING IN THE SUN
SUNLIGHT SOIL AND WATER
ITS ITS OF A CLOUD AND WIND
I KNOW IT NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE TO BREATHE
YES THEY NEED CARBON DIOXIDE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY BREATHE
YES BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY WOULD DIE
ENERGY FROM THE SUN
YES I MEAN NO
NO PLANTS DO NOT NEED FOOD THEY NEED WATER AS THEIR FOOD
IT WOULD BECAUSE THEN IT CAN PRODUCE FOOD
NEED IT OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T SURVIVE
YES BECAUSE IT HELPS THEM GROW BIGGER IT THEY DON'T NEED FERTILIZER BUT IT HELPS THEM GROW
ITS OF A HOUSE
CARBON DIOXIDE COMES IN AND THEN OXYGEN COMES OUT
SUNLIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER
SUNLIGHT WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE
WATER
FROM SUNLIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN REPEAT
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY USE WATER CARBON DIOXIDE AND LIGHT ENERGY THAT'S HOW
THEN IT DOESN'T WHEN IT DOESN'T HAVE SUN IT TURNS YELLOW
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SUN IT TURNS YELLOW
IT NEEDS AIR SO IT TURNED BROWN
BECAUSE THERE'S NO AIR
THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS AIR
CAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS
IT HAS EVERY SINGLE THING IT NEEDS
MEANS THE PLANT IS HEALTHY AND CAN I GO
THIS IS A FOOD WEB AND IT SHOWS WHAT THEY EAT
IF PLANTS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEN THE WHAT THEY PRODUCE OTHER ANIMALS CAN EAT
ARE WHAT HELPS PRODUCE AND HELP THE FOOD WEB
THEY START FROM PRODUCERS
HOW PLANTS ALL NEED THREE THINGS TO SURVIVE AND HELP FOOD WEBS AND HELP LIFE
HI
FINE I JUST HAD RECESS
CIRCULAR SYSTEM
ABOUT THE CIRCULAR SYSTEM
WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE CIRCULAR SYSTEM AND THAT HAS LITTLE AIR CELLS SO
THE LUNGS THE MOUTH
IT'S ABOUT HIM BREATHING AND GETTING AIR TO HIS BODY
IT GET BRINGS OXYGEN TO THE BODY
TO GET OXYGEN IN YOUR BODY
YOU SO YOU CAN GET OXYGEN IN YOUR BODY
IT'S SHOWING WHAT THEY ARE CALLED
OXYGEN TO THE BODY
THEY BREATHE IN OXYGEN AND LET OUT CARBON DIOXIDE
TAKE OXYGEN OUT OF OUT OF AIR
HELLO THE CIRCULAR AND THEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
SINCE IT IT'S USING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
THEY ARE DOING BEHAVIORS
THAT THE DOOR DING DONG AND THE KID GETS STARTLED
NO YES NO NO NO
A BEE SHOWING DOING A DANCE TO SHOW WHERE THE FLOWERS ARE OR THE POLLEN IS
IT HELPS THEM GET POLLEN
THE SNAKE RATTLES IT'S TAIL TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THE WEASEL GO AWAY
THE RATTLESNAKE IS SHOWING THAT IT DOESN'T WANT ANY COMPANY AND THE WEASEL IS SHOWING THAT IT'S SCARED OF IT AND WANTS TO GO
TO SCARE OFF THE PREDATOR
THAT THE DOOR'S RINGING AND THE BOY'S STARTLED OR THE DOG IS STARTLED
THE DOG BARKS
THE MOSQUITOS GOING ON THE HAND AND THEN THE OTHER HAND SLAPS IT
THE MOSQUITO GETS MUSHED BY THE OTHER HAND
STIMULUS BEE IT'S A BEE
SO THEY'RE TALKING AND THEN HE SPILLS GRAPE JUICE
IT'S A PICTURE OF THE GUY'S NERVOUS SYSTEM
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
THERE IS THE NERVES
THE SPINAL CHORD THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN
SHE I SEE THAT SHE GETS HER BRAIN MAKES IT SO SHE HITS THE BALL
THE SPINAL CHORD IT'S WHAT IT'S HOW THE BRAIN TELLS THE NERVES WHAT TO DO
MAKES YOUR BODY MOVE SO YOU CAN HIT THE BALL
THE BRAIN IS BRINGING DOWN SINGLES DOWN THE SPINAL CHORD TO THE BODY
ONE'S MAKING A STINK ONE IS LOOKING AND ONE'S MAKING A SOUND
ONE IS MAKING STINKY SMELL ONE IS MAKING A MEAN LOOK AND ONE IS MAKING A LOUD SOUND
ONE IS LOOKING ONE IS MAKING STINKY SMELLS AND ONE IS
OH PROTECT ITS DEFENSE SO IT CAN HAVE A STRONG SHELL SO NOTHING CAN HURT IT
IT HAS STRIPES TO MAKE IT LOOK TOXIC SO NO ANIMAL WILL EAT IT
THE SECOND ONE IT'S A FIN TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO SWIM
SO IT CAN BECAUSE IT HAS WEBBED WEBBED FEET
BECAUSE THE SO IT CAN SURVIVE AND CHEW IT UP FOR ITS YOUNG
THE WINGS BECAUSE THAT MAKES TOXIC AND NO ANIMALS TOXIC ONE
IT CAN SURVIVE AND
SHE IS SCARED OF THE RATTLESNAKE AND THE RATTLE SNAKES SHAKING ITS TAIL TO WARN THAT HE HE DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT
IT'S TELLING THE HER TO STAY AWAY
SKUNK IS SCARING AWAY THE WOLF BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S GONNA IT'S MAKING
THE SKUNK IS MAKING STINKY SMELL SO THE WOLF WALKS AWAY
SO IT COULD RUN AWAY
OH THE REACTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAKES HER GO BACK
IT MIGRATION
IT'S IT'S SO THE THING'S HITTING HER KNEE AND THEN HER KNEE WILL REACT AND MOVE HER LEG UP
NOT IT'S INSTINCTUAL
INSTINCTUAL BECAUSE BECAUSE HE NO THINK BECAUSE HE THINKS ABOUT JUMPING UP AND GRABBING IT
NON LEARNED BECAUSE IT'S AN INSTINCT TO GO OCEAN
THE CAT'S FALLING OFF A TREE
LEARNED INSTINCTIVE
ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
WIRES A D CELL BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
IT MUST HAVE ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
IT IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
THE WIRES HOLD THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
THE LIGHT BULB MAKES LIGHT
THE LIGHT BULB RECEIVES ALL OF THE ENERGY
ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT THE NO
THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALL FLOWING TOWARDS THE FRAME OF THE LIGHT BULB
THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
IT ALL OF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
ALL OF THE
THE ENERGY IS ALL FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THAT BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT TOUCHING THE BATTERY
THE LIGHT BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MOTORS
THE D CELL IS GENERATING POWER FOR THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS MAKING THE FLAG TURN
THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT
THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING BOTH OF THE WIRES
THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS A FULL CIRCUIT
THE SWITCH MUST BE TOUCHING THE METAL PART OF THE THAT THE WIRE IS TOUCHING
THE SWITCH IS CLOSING WHICH CREATES A FULL CIRCUIT
THE MOTOR WORKS
THERE MUST BE ENERGY COMING FROM THE SOLAR CELL
THE SKY IS TURNING DARK AND THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH ENERGY FOR THE MOTOR TO RUN
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I HAVE BEEN STUDYING SORRY I HAVE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
THEY MUST ALL BE METAL AND CAN HAVE NO INSULATION OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO GOT THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL SOME KIND OF METAL
BYE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU SEE YA LATER
ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT ENERGY
GOOD I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT ENERGY
IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT
YOU DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING
IT IT SOUNDED LIKE NOTHING
I CAN SEE THE WAS BURNING DOWN AND THE CANDLE GIVING OFF LIGHT
THE FLAME IS BURNING ON A WICK
NOISE IS HAPPENING
BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING AND EATING
THE DRUM IS VIBRATING AND CREATING NOISE
I CAN HEAR SOMETHING AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE GIRL IS WALKING AND EATING SO SHE CONSERVES ENERGY
THE GIRL WALKING
THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE HURT AND IT WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
THE AIR GETS WORSE AND THERE BECOMES SOME BAD STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE AIR
THE AIR GETS SMOKEY AND SMELLS HORRIBLE
THEY BOTH REUSE ENERGY AND THEY ARE RENEWABLE
THEY BOTH POLLUTE THE AIR
COAL AND GAS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND IT WILL NOT MAKE THE AIR GOOD
IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND MAKE THE AIR HORRIBLE
OIL COAL AND GASOLINE
BYE I'M GONNA MISS YOU SO VERY MUCH
A CIRCUIT IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES SOMETHING DO SOMETHING
THE D CELL IS CREATING ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB RUN
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH TWO LIGHT BULBS AND A D CELL
THAT IS THE THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
THE MOVING BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
IT MUST GO THROUGH THE FILAMENT TO CREATE LIGHT AND THAT IS
UM
AT LEAST THREE
THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GROW DIM
THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER AND NOT AS LIGHT
I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GROW LIGHT AND NOT AS DIM AS BEFORE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH ENERGY
THE LIGHT BULBS HAD MORE LIGHT THAN NOW
THE LIGHT BULBS WILL KEEP ON GROWING LIGHTER LIGHTER AND LIGHTER AND MORE HOT
BYE UNTIL NEXT TIME
I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
THE
HIGH
THE STRENGTH GETS THE STRENGTH IS IT'S STRONGER THE ELECTROMAGNET IS STRONGER
YOU COULD UM YOU COULD ADD MORE D CELLS
THAT INCREASES THE ELECTROMAGNET'S STRENGTH
THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GETS HIGH
THERE ARE MORE WASHERS PICKED UP
MAGNET THAT PICKS UP LOTS OF WASHERS IS STRONGER
I MIGHT DISPLAY IT BY PUTTING IT ON A GRAPH OR RECORDING IT ON A GRAPH OR
THAT TELLS YOU HOW MANY WIRE WRAPS THERE ARE AND HOW MANY WASHERS THERE ARE
THE LINES GRADUALLY GET HIGHER
WHEN THE WIRE WRAPS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASE AS WELL
I'VE DONE MY GRAPH AND MY RESULTS ARE UM NEVERMIND
WELL I DID THAT UM BECAUSE UM
THE GRAPHS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY SHOW DATA YOU'VE COLLECTED AND AND WHAT IT CAN DO
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING LIVING SYSTEMS AND FOOD WEBS AND FOOD CHAINS
A CAR IS A SYSTEM AND THAT COULD BE ONE EXAMPLE OF QUITE A FEW SYSTEMS
THIS TELLS ME THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS MADE OF MULTIPLE SUBSYSTEMS
THE THE BIOSPHERE'S MADE OF LIVING THINGS
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE JUST ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE AND THAT
I NOTICE THAT IT GOES FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST ANIMALS
I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU
ALL THREE OF THEM DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS INTERACT WITHIN A FOOD WEB
ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER ANIMALS OR ORGANISMS
THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM CONSUMERS CAUSE THEY CONSUME OTHER ORGANISMS THAT ARE LIVING
DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM OTHER ORGANISMS THAT ARE LAYING AROUND DEAD
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS IN GENERAL
I THINK THAT IS JUST PART OF FOOD WEB ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE IN IT
A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE IT MAKES FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS
IT MAKES EM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THAT IS A SYSTEM CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS
I AM A CONSUMER IT MEANS WE EAT OTHER ORGANISMS
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS OR ANIMAL
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM OTHER DEAD ORGANISMS THEIR PRODUCERS MAINLY
BECAUSE WITHOUT OUT THEM THERE WOULD WASTE ON THE GROUND THERE WOULD BE BAD STUFF ALL OVER
THE DECOMPOSERS IS THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI OR MUSHROOMS
DECOMPOSERS ARE THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI
I THINK THIS SHOWS A FOOD CHAIN I GUESS
NO I DO NOT THEY ARE ALL THE SAME
IT MEANS YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
THEY EAT A PRODUCER GRASS
HERBIVORES EAT ONLY PLANTS
A A CARNIVORE ONLY EATS MEAT
I THINK OMNIVORES EAT BOTH UM MEAT AND PLANTS
I THINK THEY EAT BOTH HERBS AND MEAT
I THINK IT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD EAT DECAYING MATTER
I THINK THAT FOX IS UM HOLD ONE SECOND SORRY
THAT MAKES THE FOX A SECONDARY CONSUMER
I THINK THAT MAKES IT A THIRD CONSUMER
THOSE ARE DECOMPOSERS THE BACTERIA THEY EAT DECAYING MATTER
A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
THEY MAKE UM COMPOST UM DIRT OR SOIL
I NOTICED THAT
GETS TURNED INTO SOIL
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS AND JUST SYSTEMS IN GENERAL
THEY UM THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY GET FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND THEY DON'T EAT OTHER ORGANISMS
BE A CONSUMER MEANS EATING OTHER ORGANISMS DEAD OR ALIVE
DECOMPOSERS ARE DECOMPOSERS BECAUSE THEY EAT DECAYING MATTER
COOL
THE PRODUCERS ARE THE TREE AND THE GRASS
ARE THE HAWK THE BIRD THE SNAKE THE BEETLE THE LIZARD AND THE BUNNY
TO BE AN HERBIVORE MEANS YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS
THEY EAT ALL TYPES OF PRODUCERS OR PLANTS
UM BEING AN HERBIVORE MEANS YOU ONLY EAT HERBS OR PLANTS SO GRASS CONNECTS TO BEING AN HERBIVORE
BEING A DECOMPOSER MEANS THAT YOU EAT DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
A RED WORM OR A RED WIGGLE IS A DECOMPOSER
THEY CHANGE DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER INTO EARTH OR SOIL
LEARNING ABOUT WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS
PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
THAT IS CONSUMERS DECOMPOSERS AND PRODUCERS
BEING A PRODUCERS MEANS GETTING FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS
A A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE IT GETS IT'S FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THAT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS
BEING A CONSUMER MEANS EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
EAT LIVE I MEAN DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
HERE ARE THE PINE CONE OR THE TREE AND THE GRASS
THE DECOMPOSERS ARE THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
NO I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
TO BE AN HERBIVORE IT MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT HERBS OR PLANTS
IT SHOWS THAT THEY EAT GRASS
ONLY EAT PLANTS THAT'S HOW THAT CONNECTS
TO BE A DECOMPOSER MEANS THAT YOU EAT DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
THOSE ARE DETRIVORES DETRIVORES
THAT MAKES THEM DETRIVORES OR DECOMPOSERS
THEY EAT DECAYING OR DECAYED MATTER
I NOTICED THAT THEY TURNED LEAVES AND NEWSPAPER INTO SOIL
IT GETS TURNED INTO SOIL
THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM LANDFILLS WOULD BE JUST THEY WOULD STAY THERE AND THEY WOULDN'T GO AWAY
BYE
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
I THINK THAT IS WHEN THE YEAST GETS ACTIVATED AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE FILLS THE BAG UP
FOR THE YEAST TO GET ACTIVATED IT NEEDS WATER AND FOOD
WHEN YEAST GETS ACTIVATED IT MAKES C O TWO OR CARBON DIOXIDE
THAT COULD BE OXYGEN INSIDE OF THE YEAST OR AIR
IT CONNECTS BECAUSE WE ALSO GREW YEAST AND THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE WHEAT WE GREW IN LIGHT
BECAUSE ONE PLANT WAS IN YEAST AND ONE PLANT WAS NOT IN YEAST
WATER SUNLIGHT AND DIRT SOIL NUTRIENTS
PLANTS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE A LIVING ORGANISMS AND ALL LIVING ORGANISMS NEED WATER AND FOOD TO SURVIVE
I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE ALL LIVING ORGANISMS NEED WATER
I SEE WIND OR AIR
PLANTS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT IT WOULD SUFFOCATE
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS AND JUST SYSTEMS
UM THIS IS YEAST WITH A ANIMAL CRACKER FOR FOOD AND WATER
THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING SYSTEMS
I OBSERVED THAT THEY'RE LITTLE CELLS
I THINK EACH OF THOSE CIRCULAR CELLS ARE EITHER THE CELLS IN YEAST OR YEAST ALONE
IT COULD BE THE YEAST ARE CELLS AND AS WELL AND THEY HAVE AIR CELLS
THIS IS UM THE TWO DIFFERENT YEASTS YEAST IN LIGHT IS THE GREEN ONE AND YEAST IN DARK IS THE NOT SO GREEN ONE
THAT IS BECAUSE UM ONE WAS IN LIGHT AND ONE WASN'T
UM WE DID THIS IN CLASS EH I GUESS THAT'S IT
I THINK IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT DIRT AND WATER
PLANTS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING SYSTEMS
PLANTS NEED WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING ORGANISMS
THIS IS SAYING THAT UM PLANTS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
ALL LIVING ORGANISMS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
PLANTS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING ORGANISMS AND ALL LIVING ORGANISMS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
I THINK PLANTS NEED AIR JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LIVING ORGANISM
THIS IS THE SUN AND IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT
UM IT NEEDS NUTRIENTS FROM THE SUN VITAMIN C I GUESS
PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT BECAUSE ALL OTHER ORGANISMS NEED IT WITHOUT SUNLIGHT THEY WOULD FREEZE OR DIE BECAUSE IT HAD NO FOOD
YES NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN COULD CAUSE TO DEATH BECAUSE OF NO FOOD
UM PLANTS ALSO NEED FOOD JUST LIKE US
YES THE PLANT UM THE PLANT WOULD DIE BECAUSE OF STARVATION
PLANTS NEED FOOD JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ORGANISMS LIVING ORGANISMS
IF A PLANT DIDN'T GET FOOD IT WOULD STARVE TO DEATH
PANT PLANTS DO NEED FERTILIZER OR SOIL OF SORTS
PLANTS DO NOT NEED FERTILIZER THEY DO NEED SOIL HOWEVER
PLANT
I KNOW THAT PLANTS DON'T NEED SHELTER BUT THEY DO NEED A HABITAT
THEY GET THEIR FOOD FROM LIGHT AND ENERGY OR LIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY FOR THEM
THEY GET FOOD FROM THE LIGHT
THEY GET THEIR FOOD FROM UM SOIL LIGHT AND AIR THROUGH A SYSTEM CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THEY GO ABOUT GETTING FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THEY DO IT THROUGH SYSTEM CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS
IT'S SHOWING THAT IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE SUNLIGHT
THIS PLANT DOESN'T HAVE SUNLIGHT
I'M DOING WELL HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT SYSTEMS
ALL LIVING THINGS HAVE CELLS
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS AND I GUESS THIS SOMETHING IS LIVING LOOKS LIKE YEAST
I NOTICE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A TON OF THINGS WITH WELL IT LOOKS LIKE A BODY WITH HIGHLIGHTED PARTS
I NOTICE MUSCLE CELLS OR AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT LOOK LIKE MUSCLES
MUSCLE CELLS ARE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE UP A MUSCLE
IT LOOKS LIKE BRAIN CELLS
SHOWING ME THE BRAIN IS MADE OF UP OF MULTIPLE BRAIN CELLS
BRAIN CELLS ARE THINGS THAT MAKE UP YOUR BRAIN AND THEY HOLD MEMORY AND THEY MAKE MOVE
THESE CELLS MAKE UP YOUR SKIN AND WITHOUT IT THEN WELL YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE CAUSE OF LOSS OF BLOOD
I KNOW THAT SKIN CELLS MAKE UP YOUR SKIN
FUR CELLS
I THINK THEY ARE MOSTLY THE SAME THING EXCEPT FOR THE FUR
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO SOME SORT TO SOME DEGREE
THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW US THAT A HUMAN AND THE YEAST SKIN CELLS ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR
THEY'RE DIFFERENT SHAPE AND DIFFERENT COLOR
THAT JUST SHOWS US THAT HUMAN AND LEAF CELLS ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR
THIS TELLS ME THAT HUMANS ARE MADE OF MULTIPLE CELLS AND YEAH
I KNOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE UNIQUE CELLS IN THEM AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AT ALL
I THINK THE HUMAN HAS THE MOST CELLS BECAUSE IT'S THE LARGEST
THIS SHOWS US A LIVING ANIMAL AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LIVING ANIMALS
THEY NEED POLLEN AND FOOD AND WATER AND LIGHT
THEY HAVE A FAIRLY SIMILAR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THIS SHOW US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF A HUMAN
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING UP FOOD AND PUTTING IT OUT OF YOUR BODY AND HOW IT COMES IN
IT BREAKS IT DOWN AND PUTS IT MAKES IT WASTE AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF YOUR BODY
THE MOUTH CHEWS IT AND BREAKS IT DOWN THE FOOD DOWN INTO SMALL PARTS
THE MOUTH CHEWS AND SWALLOWS THE FOOD SO IT GOES FARTHER INTO THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE ESOPHAGUS BREAKS IT DOWN EVEN MORE AND IT SENDS IT'S WAY TO THE STOMACH
THE ESOPHAGUS SENDS ALL THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
STOMACH BREAKS DOWN THE FOOD TO EVEN SMALLER PIECES
THE INTESTINES BREAK IT DOWN TO EVEN SMALLER PARTS
THEY SEND ALL THE WASTE OUT OF YOUR BODY AND BREAK IT DOWN TO REALLY SMALL PIECES
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS
YOUR LUNGS YOUR HEART AND YEAH
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM GIVES OXYGEN TO YOUR BLOOD
BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT GIVING C O O TWO OR OXYGEN TO YOUR BLOOD
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING LIVING SYSTEMS AND HOW ANIMALS COMMUNICATE
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE SHOWING A FEELINGS
I NOTICE THAT
NO NOT ALL ANIMAL BEHAVIORS ARE THE SAME
THIS BENEFITS THEM BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND FOOD THEN THEY WOULD STARVE
THIS COULD BENEFIT THEM AS WELL BECAUSE THEN WELL I'M NOT SURE
THAT IS THE RATTLESNAKE WARNING EVERYBODY TO STAY AWAY
IT SHAKES IT'S TAIL TO EXPLAIN TO THE OTHER ANIMAL TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM AND HE'S A PREDATOR
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER REASON MAYBE TO TELL HIM THAT HE'S A PREDATOR
THE
IT GOT
THE WEASEL RAN AWAY SO THE RATTLESNAKE DIDN'T HAVE TO ATTACK HIM
THE DOG AND THE HUMAN WAKES UP
IT SHOWS THE HUMAN SLAPPING THE MOSQUITO
THE HUMAN SLAPS THE MOSQUITO
WE ALL THAT A REFLEX
A REFLEX
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
IT CONTROLS ALL OF YOUR BODY AND WHAT IT DOES
IT IS THE THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
IT SHOWS THE THREE MAIN PARTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
THE NERVES THE BRAIN AND THE SPINAL CHORD
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS THREE MAIN PARTS THE SPINAL CHORD THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN
THIS SHOWS THREE ANIMALS AND WE'VE BEEN STUDYING LIVING SYSTEMS
ONE ADAPTATION IS THE TURTLE HAVING TO ADAPT TO THE VERY DRY LAND
HAVING A GOOD EYE SO IT CAN SEE PREDATORS AND PREY
WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT ADAPTATIONS AND INSTINCTS AND REACTIONS AND STIMULI AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF
THE SECOND ADAPTATION BECAUSE WITHOUT WEBBED FEET IT WOULDN'T BE GOING ANYWHERE VERY FAST
IT'S VERY VERY SHARP TEETH
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE BRIGHT COLORS ON ANIMAL THEN IT MEANS IT'S POISONOUS OR TOXIC
IT SHOWS THE HUMAN BEING SURPRISED AND SCARED FROM THE RATTLESNAKE
SNAKE THE SNAKE IS RATTLING ITS TAIL JUST WANTING THE PERSON TO STAY AWAY
THAT'S THE STIMULUS FOR THE HUMAN AND THE HUMAN'S REACTION IS TO SCREAM OR START RUNNING AWAY
THE REACTION OF THE GIRL IS TO SCREAM AND RUN AWAY
THIS IS ALL ABOUT A DOG CATCHING A FRISBEE WHEN THE FRISBEE IS THROWN
THE FRISBEE IS A STIMULUS THE DOG'S REACTION IS TO GO GO CHASE AFTER AND CATCH IT
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
A WIRE AND A BATTERY
THEY GIVE YOU ENERGY SO AS TO LIGHT THE
IT HAS ENERGY SOURCE
IT HELPS PRODUCE ENERGY
YOU PUT THE UM
IF YOU PUT WIRE TO THE BULB IT WILL
THE WIRES HELP THE BULB LIGHT
I DO NOT UM
IT MEANS THAT UM THE LIGHT IS COMING
THE LIGHT BULB HELPS PRODUCE UM GOING TO SHINE
THE BATTERY GIVES THE ENERGY TO LET IT
THE BLUE DOTS MEANS THE ELECTRICITY
ENERGY IS GOING TO THE BULB
BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY
IT GOES TOWARDS THE BATTERY
IT'S GOING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN GOES TO THE BATTERY
GOING AWAY FROM THE BATTERY
IT'S GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN TO THE BATTERY
I NOTICE THAT IT'S GOING DOWN
LEARNING ABOUT THE BULB
LIGHTS UP YOU CAN TELL IT'S WORKING
WORKING
IT IT AND THE FLAG TURNS
THAT'S THAT THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT'S WORKING
THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
BECAUSE IT IS A CONNECTED TO THE
THE FLAG DOESN'T
TURN SO YOU COULD HERE
IT'S IT'S TURNING THE FLAG IS TURNING BECAUSE IT LINKED UP
THE MOTOR IS TURNING
IT GOES AROUND THE BATTERY AND
INSTEAD OF THE BULB THE SUN
SUN IS IT'S LIGHTING AND THEN THE FLAG IS TURNING
THE SUN NEEDS TO LET THE THE THING THEN
THE SUN IT'S GOING
SUN NEEDS TO SHINE TO THE SOLAR CELL
IT GETS THE SUNLIGHT
THE FLAG IS
MAKES THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE SUN IS IS SHINING TO THE
IT DOESN'T TURN
THERE'S KIND OF NO SUN
IT'S GOING AROUND THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
HI
THE PAPER CLIP TOUCHING THE METAL
IT'S METAL SO IT'S
PARTICLES THAT IS NOT
FANTASTIC
PLASTIC DOESN'T WORK METAL
THE PLASTIC AND YOU PUT THE PLASTIC
WE NEED TWO LIGHT BULBS TWO TWO WIRES TO TWO LIGHT BULBS
THE
THE BATTERIES
WOULD NOT
YOU NEED THREE WIRE TO LET
THE D CELL DOESN'T
YEAST AND DRYING OUT
IT HAS MORE YEAST THAN THE OTHER
THEY DO BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER
THEY CAN'T PUT THE PLANT IN THERE THEY
THE WATER THE SUN THE PLANTS THE
THAT THE LIGHT WATER OXYGEN
GETTING ROTTEN THE AIR WATER DOING THE JOB BUT
IT'S YELLOW AND ROTTEN
GIVES IT MORE A LOT OF
AIR IS GETTING TOO MUCH
GETTING MORE ROTTEN IN IT
AFTER IT IT'S BECOMING THING THAT
IT'S GIVING IT WATER AIR
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
D CELL MAGNET I MEAN BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
BATTERY IS JUST ENERGY AND YOU NEED AN ENERGY SOURCE TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
THEY UM IT HELPS IT MAKES A PATHWAY SO THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY CAN GO TO THE BULB
IT MEANS THEY HELP THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY UM TRAVEL THROUGH TO GET TO THE BULB
WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY
THE LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE MAGNET
WELL THE D CELL BATTERY HAS THE ENERGY THAT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE BULB AND THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED THE RECEIVER
IT MEANS THE UM BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TRAVELING THROUGH THE PATHWAY INTO THE BULB
I HAVE A QUESTION REAL QUICK
UH WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE BULB IT TRAVELS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL THE D CELL BATTERY
I HAVE A QUESTION
IT CHANGES IT CHANGES DIRECTION
THE POSITIVE SIDE
THEY HAVE TO BE IN A FULL CIRCUIT
THE LIGHT WOULD NOT SHINE FROM THE BULB
I NOTICE THAT THE LIGHT IS NOT SHINING
BYE YOU'RE AWESOME
THERE'S A FULL CIRCUIT AND A NAIL CONNECTING THE CIRCUIT
THERE THERE'S THE MOTOR AND THE WIRES WHICH ARE THE PATHWAY
THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
THIS IS A FULL CIRCUIT
THE SPONGE IS AN INSULATOR AND NOT A CONDUCTOR
IT SPINS
YOU MAKE A CLOSED CIRCUIT
THE INSULATOR DOESN'T LET THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT
THEY ARE STRAWS LIKE A ROCK SOMETHING THAT'S NOT METAL
THEY ARE ALL METAL OBJECTS
LEARNING ABOUT SCORPIONS
I SEE A CANDLE
THE FLAME IS MOVING CAUSE MAYBE THE DRAFT IN THE ROOM
BECAUSE WITHOUT ENERGY A LOT OF THINGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE
THE WAX IS MELTING
IT FELT VERY WARM
THE WAX
IT'S BURNING AND THE WAX IS MELTING
IT SOUNDED KIND OF LOUD A LITTLE TINY BIT
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
SHE'S EATING AN APPLE WHICH GIVES HER A LOT OF ENERGY
YOU'RE USING YOUR ENERGY TO MAKE NOISE
YOU'RE USING YOUR ENERGY TO PLAY THE DRUMS WHICH MAKES A NOISE
THIS GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE'S EATING AN APPLE TO GET ENERGY
I SEE SOME OBJECT
A FAN AN APPLE WHICH IS FOOD SOME COAL AND A GAS TANK
I THINK EVERYTHING WILL BURN DOWN
IT IT SMELLS AND IT GETS FOGGY
THE AIR STARTS TO SMELL A LITTLE GASSY
THE MOTOR THAT IS HOOKED ON TO IT WILL RUN
WE WON'T WASTE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY SO IT'LL MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
NON GASOLINE
THEY BOTH BOTH ABSORB SOLAR POWER TO MAKE ENERGY
THEY BOTH ARE USED FOR VEHICLES
THE COAL AND THE GAS ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER
HOW MANY KINDS OF GAS ARE THERE
WHAT KIND OF GAS IS A COAL
SOME ARE USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS
A NON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
THANK YOU MARNEY
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
WELL YOU MUST HAVE A FULL CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE MOTOR OR RUN
THE THE ENERGY FLOW IS FLOWING FROM THE D CELL BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB
THERE HAS TO BE A RECEIVER AND A
THIS CIRCUIT THE PATHWAY ARE THE WIRES
IT COMES FROM THE BATTERY AND GOES INTO THE TWO BULBS
IT'S THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
IT SHOWS HOW THE ENERGY MOVES
IT TELLS YOU THEY HAVE TO THROW FLOW THROUGH BOTH OF THE
THE RELATIONSHIP IS THE WIRES AND THE BULBS
IT'S VERY IT'S HAS TO BE A FULL
YOU WOULD NEED MORE THAN ONE BATTERY
THE BULBS ARE MUCH DIMMER
BOTH THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS MUCH LIGHTER
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BULBS IS RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY
BECAUSE IF THE NEGATIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE CAN NOT PRODUCE ENERGY
THAT THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE HAVE TO BE TOUCHING FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
IF YOU TURN THE BATTERY AROUND
IF YOU PUT THE POSITIVE SIDE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE
I'M FANTASTIC HOW ARE YOU
WELL WE JUST STARTED A NEW UNIT CALLED LIVING SYSTEM
YOU NEED YOU NEED EYESIGHT TO SEE STUFF YOU NEED LIGHT TO SEE STUFF
WELL HE SEES THE LIGHT WITH HIS EYES
A PERSON IS FLICKERING THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF
NEED LIGHT TO SEE THINGS
IT BOUNCES INTO YOUR EYES
FANTASTIC HOW ARE YOU
THESE ARE ALL SYSTEMS
THEY ARE ALL SYSTEM
WELL IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS MANY SUBSYSTEMS
IS A SYSTEM SYSTEM
THE PARTS OF THE CAR WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM
INTERACTING PARTS TO MAKE A SYSTEM
A BODY IS A SYSTEM
IT SHOWS YOU DIFFERENT PARTS
LIVING SYSTEMS
YEAST AND ANIMAL CRACKERS AND STUFF
THE YEAST IS A LIVING SYSTEM AND IT'S COMING TO LIFE
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE LIVING SYSTEMS
I OBSERVED THAT THE BAG IS
PLANTS HAVE GROWN IN OUR CLASS
UM THERE ARE TWO PLANT
EXCUSE ME WHAT DID YOU SAY MARNI REPEAT PLEASE REPEAT PLEASE REPEAT
THEY MIGHT OF HAD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF SUNLIGHT
WATER SPACE SUN
SOIL AND LIGHT AND HEAT
YES THEY DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU YOU ARE BOTHERING ME
THEY DO YES YES YES I'M YOU ASKED ME THIS ALREADY AND I'M SAYING YES
I DON'T KNOW I ALREADY CLICKED ON THE ARROW ACCIDENTALLY
PLANTS NEED SUN
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU YOU ARE BOTHERING ME
YES IT WOULD
YES IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
NO I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED FERTILIZER BECAUSE SOME TYPES OF PLANTS DIE WITH IT I'M GOING TO EAT YOU
THAT PLANTS DO NOT NEED SHELTER SOME DO BUT SOME DON'T
THEY NEED SHELTER I MEAN NO THEY DON'T NEED SHELTER
PLANTS HAVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
MARNI YOU'VE ASKED HIS LIKE FIVE TIMES YOU CAN STOP ASKING THIS NOW I'VE ANSWERED THIS ALREADY
THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SUN
I'VE ANSWERED THIS ALREADY IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH SUN
IT'S ALL YELLOW AND IT HAS BANANA PEEL
IT HAS SUN AND WATER BUT NO
IT HAS SUN AND IT HAS AIR BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY WATER
INSIDE THE PLANT IS HEALTHY
I KNOW THAT THERE IS FOOD AND WEBS INVOLVED
OR ANIMALS EAT THE PLANT
I'VE ANSWERED THIS ALREADY MARNI IT MEANS THE TREES HAVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
FROM THE PRODUCERS
BYE BUT BYE BYE IT'S MATEA'S TURN MATEA HAVE LOTS OF FUN THIS IS REALLY
WE HAVE LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
YOU NEED TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE D CELL
IT'S THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
THE LIGHT BULB LIKE GIVES LIGHT TO MAKE THE ROOM BRIGHTER OR TO MAKE LIKE COMPUTERS WORK
THE LIGHT BULB WOULD UM TURN OFF AND ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T FLOW THROUGH THE BULB ANYMORE
ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE IT
OKAY SOUNDS GOOD
SCORPIONS
ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
IT HELPS YOU SEE LIKE WITH THE LIGHTS ON IN THE CLASSROOM OR IN YOUR HOUSE
I SEE THE CANDLE RUNNING AND THE WAX MELTING A BIT A LITTLE
THE WAX MELTS SO AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS THE FLAME
THEY HOT AND IF YOU REALLY MOVE YOUR HAND CLOSE IT WOULD FEEL REALLY REALLY HOT
WAX OR IT'S WICK
IT'S WAX AND IT'S WICK
WAX IS MELTING AND WHEN IT MELTS THE FLAME WILL SOON GO OUT
WELL IF YOU LIT A CANDLE IT WOULD BE KIND OF LIKE A SPARK LIKE
THE CANDLE FLAME IS MOVING
IT'S MOVING AND SORT OF LIKE HEAT BUT IT LIGHT'S THE ROOM AT THE SAME TIME
CAN YOU GO BACK TO THE DRUMS
THE APPLE IS EVIDENCE
IT DOESN'T HELP THE ENVIRONMENT
GAS IT MAKES YOU COUGH SNEEZE RUNNY NOSE SOMETIMES
WELL THE MOTOR WILL RUN IN THIS PICTURE
THEY DON'T MEAN THE SAME THING
COAL IS TO BURN FIRE AND THE GAS IS LIKE FOR YOUR THE GASOLINE IS LIKE FOR YOU R CAR OR SOMETHING
THEY'RE DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS
WELL COAL AND GAS ARE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
WELL SOME OF THEM ARE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND SOME ARE REALLY BAD
ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
WELL CIRCUIT
IT HELPS ENERGY RUN THROUGH TO MAKE LIGHTS
WELL IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE SO EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
THE ELECTRICITY'S FLOWING THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS INTO ONE D CELL
I THINK THAT THEY'RE MOVING NOT THAT FAST
I THINK IF WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL THE BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE MORE ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH
IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE WITH TWO D CELLS IT'S MUCH BRIGHTER
GREAT
I KNOW THAT
THE WIRE HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND VERY TIGHTLY
THE WIRES NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
I NOTICE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE
THERE ARE TEN WINDS AROUND THE CORE
IF YOU PRESS THE NUMBER OF WIND IT CAN GET MORE WINDS WRAPPED AROUND
IT GETS STRONGER
THERE ARE SEVEN WASHERS ATTACHED TO THE THE RIVET
YOU COULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS YOU YOU WRAP AROUND IT
IT'LL HAVE MORE ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES
THE WASHERS WILL PICK UP MORE MORE WASHERS WILL PICK UP
OH I WOULD TEST AND THEN I WOULD
IF THE WIRE WRAP INCREASES YOU'LL GET MORE OR
AS THE NUMBER OF WRAPS GETS LARGER THE NUMBER OF WASHERS INCREASES ALSO
IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED WIRE WRAP IT'LL BE BETTER
I THINK IT WOULD PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
BECAUSE
THEY ARE ON THE SAME LINE EVERY TIME
GOOD
THE HUMAN SYSTEM AND CAR SYSTEM
WELL CAR IS A SYSTEM
UM IT'S A SYSTEM AND AND IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS
EACH OF THESE UM PARTS ARE INTERACTING PARTS WHICH HELP THE CAR MOVE
WELL THE PARTS ARE INTERACTING AND SUBSYSTEMS ARE HELPING A SYSTEM
HUMAN A HUMAN IS AN INTERACTING PART
IT SHOWS YOU WHERE SOME OF THE THE INTERACTING PART ENDS UP
ALL THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THE HEART
DIDN'T WORK
UM WELL EARTH IS IS A IS A SYSTEM
A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND SUBSYSTEMS
I THINK THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT UM
IT SHOWS WHAT THINGS EAT
SHOW WHAT THINGS EAT
HELLO
HI I'M GOOD
I'M DOING GREAT
YEAST YEAST
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT YEAST
NEEDS WATER AND FOOD TO ACTIVATE
NO WAY
I OBSERVE THE YEAST IS ACTIVATING
ARE THE CELLS OF YEAST
IT IS LIKE YEAST
I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE ONE'S DEAD AND ONE IS NOT
YES I CAN BECAUSE ONE'S DEAD AND ONE IS NOT
I JUST SAID IT WATER
UH YEAH
LISTEN YES
UM PLANTS NEED SHELTER TO SURVIVE
PLANTS DO NEED SHELTER
PLANTS DON'T EXACTLY NEED SHELTER
PLANTS DO NEED SUN YES SO IT CAN'T GO INSIDE OF A HOUSE OR SHELTER
I SEE A SHELTER I SEE A SHELTER I SEE A
UM YES AND IT WOULD LIVE IF IF IT DIDN'T HAVE SHELTER
THIS PICTURE AS YOU SAID IS SHOWING SHELTER YES RIGHT
BECAUSE PLANTS DO NEED FOOD OH MOST DEFINITELY OH MOST DEFINITELY
NO
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
I LEARNED THAT THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN I MEAN THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW
I DON'T KNOW
IS HAS WATER AND IT HAS SPACE AND AIR BUT IT HAS NO SUN SO IT'S DIE
THIS PLANT IS DYING
THAT ONE IS TOTALLY COMPLETELY DYING BECAUSE IT HAS NO SPACE AND AIR
A PLANT NEEDS AIR
HAS NO WATER SO IT'S DROOPY
THIS HAS ALL OF THE THREE ABOVE SO IT'S GROWING BEAUTIFULLY
UM EXCUSE ME UM WHAT DID YOU SAY MOMMY
IT HAS ALL THREE OF THE ABOVE
IT MEANS AS I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT IT'S GROWING
I KNOW THAT THAT CAN RELATE TO SOMETHING
UHM IN THIS CIRCUIT THE BOTH LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO CIRCUITS
EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY IT HAS ITS OWN
UHM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WELL SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
UHM ON ONE SIDE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES ON ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE'S ONE
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SYSTEMS
THEY IT IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE IT'S A SYSTEM OF A CAR
GOOD
UHM WELL WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THOSE IS HOW TO POWER THEM
UHM UH WE WERE THIS IS UHM A BATTERY IS AND A LIGHT BULB
UHM EVERYTHING WILL STOP ALL OF THE LIGHTS WILL GO OUT IF ONE GOES OUT
UHM SERIES CIRCUITS IF ONE GOES OUT IT ALL GOES OUT I REPEAT IF ONE GOES OUT ALL GOES OUT
UH UHM THEY'LL GO
THERE'S A BURNED OUT BULB AND A LIGHTING BULB
CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IF ONE BURNS OUT THEY ALL WON'T BURN OUT
THEY'RE EACH ON THEIR OWN PATH SO THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PATH OF ELECTRICITY SO YEAH
UHM THEY'RE BOTH OUT BECAUSE ONE IS OUT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT SO IF ONE BREAKS THEY ALL BREAK
THEY'RE ALL ON THE SAME PATH OF ELECTRICITY SO IF ONE DOESN'T WORK THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW
UHM WE WENT OVER HOW SERIES CIRCUITS IF ONE GOES OUT IT ALL GO OUTS AND PARALLEL HOW ONE GOES OUT THEY WON'T ALL GO OUT
GRAMS O O D GOOD
THIS IS PROBABLY AN ELECTRICITY
I SEE THAT THERE ARE
IT DOESN'T GLOW
I'M GOOD
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
I SAW THAT WHEN I CLICKED THE SWITCH THE LIGHT BULB GLOWED
THE WHOLE SET BURNS OUT
SERIES
WE KNOW THAT WITH A PARALLEL
THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE I TURNED ON I TURN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON AND THAT LIT THE LIGHT
OTHER ONE WILL BURN BURN OUT
I NOTICE THAT WHEN I TURN OUT A LIGHT BULB THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T
THE ONE THAT I CLICKED GOES OUT BUT THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T
I NOTICE THAT I CLICKED ON ONE BUT THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T GO OUT
WHEN HE ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT THE OTHER ONE GOES
GOOD GOOD
WHAT
YOU OBSERVE A POWER A POWER THAT UH
A LIGHT BULB CIRCUIT
GREAT MARNI THANKS HOW BOUT YOU
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
THAT YOU HAVE TO LIKE UM BE ABLE TO SEE STUFF CAUSE AT NIGHT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING
ONE ON THE LEFT CORNER
THE PENCIL MAKES A REFLECTION AND THE REFLECTION GOES TO THE SIDE
FROM THE GLASS MAKES THE PENCIL LOOK LIKE IT'S ALL WEIRD IN THE GLASS WITH THE WATER
I THINK IT'S IN THE EAST
THIS RELATES BECAUSE IT SHOWS WHEN THE SHOWS WHERE THE SHADOW WAS AT WHAT TIME
I NOTICE THAT THE SHADOWS GET SHORTER AND SHORTER AND THEN IT GOES BACK UP AGAIN SO IT'S LONGER
I NOTICE THAT THEY START LONG AND AND GROW SHORTER SHORTER AND THEN THEY GROW LONG AGAIN
I THINK THE SUN IS IN THE EAST
THE SUN WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE EAST
IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY ABOVE SINCE IT'S POINTING DOWN
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DIRECTLY OVERHEAD OF THE TREE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE ABOUT SEVEN A METERS OR AT LEAST EIGHT A METERS
I THINK OR C
THE SHADOW ON THE LEFT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SHADOWS AND THE SUN
THIS IS HAS TO DO BECAUSE THE BOY IS SPINNING THIS REPRESENTS THE SUN SPINNING ON ITS AXIS
THIS DEMONSTRATES HOW IT'S DAY AND NIGHT
THIS IS SHOWING THE AXIS OF THE
THIS CONNECTS BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE AXIS OF WHAT THE EARTH IS AND PART OF IT'S DAY AND NIGHT
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND SHADOWS
IT HAS TO DO WITH MEASUREMENT
THIS IS A SOLVENT
THIS IS A SOLUTE
THIS SOLUTION MUST BE A
GOOD
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM
I SEE THAT PLANETS AND COMETS OR ROCKS ARE ORBITING AROUND THE SUN
I SEE PLANETS SUN UHM ASTEROID ALSO KNOWN AND THE ASTEROID BELT
THIS IS SHOWING US A PICTURE OF THE SUN AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SUN IS MOSTLY MADE OF HELIUM AND HYDROGEN
THE PLANETS CLOSEST TO THE SUN ARE CALLED TERRESTRIAL PLANETS WHICH IS MERCURY MARS EARTH AND VENUS
I NOTICE THAT TERRESTRIAL PLANETS COME FIRST AND THEN THE GAS GIANTS
I THINK THIS IS SHOWING US HOW THE EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN AND THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER
IT IS LIKE A UM A DOME AND AND IT
UM I THINK IT STAYS LIKE A DOME BECAUSE IT'S ON A SURFACE AND IT POPS WHEN YOU ADD TOO MUCH MODER TOO MUCH WATER
THEY CAN SPREAD AROUND AND IF YOU MOVE THEM AROUND THEY
THE WATER WOULD HOLD IT TOGETHER BY BY UM
IT
I THINK IT'S ABOUT SOAPY AND SALTY WATER GOING INSIDE IT
IT IS ALL ABOUT NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT POP AND TRYING TO KEEP IT STEADY
I THINK IT'LL POP AT AT LEAST TWENTY DROPS
THAT IT GETS BIGGER AND THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A DOME OVER
SERVICE TEN SURFACE TENSERS
THAT IT POPS AT SIX DROPS
I WOULD'VE SAID THE WATER WAS DENSE AND THAT IT FLOATED
THAT ONE WAS HOT AND THE OTHER IS COLD
IT IS DENSE
THE DENSE
THIRTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
IT WAS AT FORTY MILLIMETERS NOT IT'S AT TWENTY FOUR
THAT IT EXPANDED
IT IS ABOUT IF IT'S COLD OR WARM
IT IT INCREASES
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER
THAT IT COULD BE A LIQUID OR A SOLID
THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE THE JUNGLE DESERT REFRIGERATOR AND LIVING ROOM
THAT THEY COULD DRY UP OR THEY OR THEY CAN STAY THE SAME IN SOME PLACES
THAT IN SOME PLACES IT CAN DRY UP AND SOME THEY CAN'T
THAT IN HOTTER PLACES IT CAN DRY UP FASTER THAN IN COLDER PLACES
PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE UNDER THE COAT RACK AND IN A LOCKER
THAT SOME ARE HOTTER THAN OTHERS
THAT SOME ARE HOTTER THAN THE OTHERS
THAT SOME IN ARE SOME ARE IN HOTTER PLACES AND SOME ARE IN COOLER PLACES
IT IS HOTTER THAN ALL OF THE OTHERS
IT'S IT EVAPORATES FASTER THAN THAN THE OTHER PLACES
THAT THE HOTTEST LAST FOUR MILLIMETERS OUT OF OUT OF ALL THE REST
THAT IT CAN GET UP TO
THAT IT LOSES LESS AMOUNT THAN THE OTHERS
THAT THEY LOST THE LE THE LI THE LESS AMOUNT
THAT THEY LOST MORE WATER THAN THE OTHERS
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WATER AND TODAY WE MADE MILLS
IT CAN BE IT CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU AND SOMETIMES IT CAN BE BAD
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU CAN MAKE MILLS
IT CAN IT CAN
IT'S ABOUT CLEARING WATER AND MAKING ELECTRICITY
YOU CAN FILTER WATER WITH THE WINDMILL AND IT GOES INTO THIS LAKE AND YOU CAN ALSO CREATE ELECTRICITY
WE USED A SYRINGE AND WE HAD TO SQUIRT THEM AS FAST AS WE COULD TO ONTO THE MILL
WE USED A SYRINGE AND WE SQUIRTED THEM AS FAST WE COULD
THAT IT CAN CREATE MORE ELECTRICITY TO LIFT THE OBJECT
THEY MOVE AND LIFT THE OBJECT
THEY ARE WHAT MAKE THE WINDMILL MOVE
WE PUT WATER ON IT AND IT WENT FASTER AND FASTER WHEN WHEN WE ADDED MORE WATER
BY THE ENERGY AND
WE MADE IT MOVE BY THE SYRINGE AND THE FASTER WE GOT THE SYRINGE IT GOT FASTER AND FASTER
IT CAN BE LOWERED OR IT CAN BE HIGH OR IT CAN GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
WE USED UM PAPER WAX PAPER WHITE PAPER
IT LOOKS COOLS AND IT'S SORT OF FUN
I DO THINK THAT I DO THAT
I SEE WATER WHEN IF WHEN IT RAINS
I SEE WATER FROM LOTS OF PLACES
LIKE OUTSIDE AND WHEN IT RAINS
WE'RE USING THE SPONGE TO CLEAN THE WATER WHEN IT FALLS
THE SPONGE WILL S CLEAN THE WATER
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER
WE DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING WHEN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SCIENCE
I FELT THE HOT WATER AND THE HOT WATER WAS HOT AND THE COLD WATER WAS COLD
FOR SCIENCE WE USED UM MMM
WE CAN UM SEE HOW COLD OR HOT THE WATER IS
THE LIQUID GOES UP WHEN IT'S UM HOT WATER AND THE LIQUID GOES DOWN WHEN IT'S COLD WATER
MINUS WE COULD SEE HOW THE HOW THE WATER USED TO PE HOW THE WATER USED TO BE BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IT UM HOT WATER THE WATER WENT UM UP
THE WATER LEVEL WENT UP AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT WENT DOWN
THE WATER UM
THE HOT WATER IS GOING UM UP
ALL OF THE CONTAINERS ALL OF THE ARE THE ARE THE SAME
I THINK THE ONE THAT HAS THE MOST EVAPORATION IS THE ONE THAT IS IN THE
YES BECAUSE THE SUN
FOR SCIENCE I'VE BEEN DOING PUTTING TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE UM
SURFACE AREA IS LIKE A RIVER AND IF YOU THREW A ROCK AND IT GOES ON TOP OF IT
EVAPORATION IS WHEN WATER GOES UP AND IT TURNS INTO A CLOUD
I THINK THE ONE THAT HAS THE MOST EVAPORATION IS THE ONE THAT UM IS NEXT TO A SHAPE
THE WATER NEEDS TO BE NEAR S UM A SHADE OR THE SUNLIGHT
IT'S UM WATER AND IT'S AND IF YOU PUT THE WATER IN THE FREEZER IT'S GONNA BE ICE AND THEN THE WATER'S GOING TO MELT
THE SURFACE AREA IS THE THING THAT'S UM UH IN THE MIDDLE
THE WATER'S EVAPORATING AND IT GOES UP IN THE SKY
WHEN THE WATER RECYCLE
IT HAS BUBBLES IT HAS LITTLE BEADS
WHEN WATER'S IN THE IN THE SKY WHEN THE AIR HE CANNOT SEE THE WATER
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO
WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT WATER ON STUFF
TH IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER YOU CAN SLIDE
PAPER TOWEL IT WILL SOAK THROUGH
WELL I GUESS THAT ON THE PAPER TOWEL IT SOAKED THROUGH AND I WAS RIGHT
ON THE FOIL IT JUST WHEN SHE DROPPED IT E EXPLODED AND AND SLID DOWN
WELL INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THE SAME IT WENT INTO A BIG PUDDLE
THE PAPER TOWEL IS EXPANDING W WITH WATER BECAUSE THE WATER GOT DROPPED AND THEN IT JUST
WELL ON THE WAX PAPER IF THEY GOT BY THEY'D JUST COME TOGETHER AND THEY'D GET REAL BIG
UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT ON WAX PAPER IT MAKES A DOME KIND OF
BECAUSE IT KEEPS GETTING IT'LL KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND IT'LL SPREAD IT OUT MORE
THAT IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER IT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN IT STARTS GETTING ON THE WHOLE PENNY
IT GETS REALLY REALLY TALL
I AM LEARNING ABOUT SLOPES
THERE IS A DROP GOING REALLY DOWN THE SLOPE REALLY FAST
IT'S GOING DOWN REALLY FAST AND UH
YOU CAN SEE IT GOING REALLY FAST
I CAN SEE THAT THE ARROW IS POINTING TO THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS STRETCHING
THE WATER'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE THE SLOPE IS LIKE BENDING DOWN
THAT ONE IS BIG ONE IS MEDIUM AND ONE IS SMALL
WELL IT DEPENDS WHAT SIZE THEY ARE IF THEY'RE BIG MEDIUM OR SMALL
MMM WELL I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MAYBE CAUSE IT'S ER THI
I THINK LIKE TWO MORE DROPS MAKE IT UM BIG
UM TO A LITTLE DROP UM I THINK I WOULD NEED TO ADD ANOTHER DROP AND THEN MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE BIGGER ANOTHER DROP
UM THE WATER GOES DOWN REALLY FAST IT GOES DOWN FASTER UM BECAUSE THE THE TRAY IS MORE LIKE
YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
AM I NOT TALKING TO YOU ANYMORE MARNIE
UM TODAY I LEARNED ABOUT A DEN ABOUT LIKE DENSERS
UH HOT AND COLD WATER
THE FIRST CUP IT'S FLOATING AND THE SECOND CUP THEY ARE NOT FLOATING
LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT MARNIE
UH AND THEN THE WA THE OH THE WATER IS GETTING OUT YEAH IT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING
WHAT IS A C CORK MARNIE
I ALSO DID THIS WITH COLD WATER
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN MARNIE
YES I WILL I AGREE WITH YOU MARNIE WAI
UH RIGHT I CAN SEE THAT RIGHT HERE IS RED WATER AND COLD WATER
IS THIS REGULAR WATER OR C OR UH BLUE WATER
UM WELL LOOK I DON'T REALLY I'M GOING THROUGH THE WRONG WING CAUSE I THINK YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT MUCH OKAY SO LOOK EM WITH WITH THE
BYE MARNIE MY NAME IS JACQUELINE
YOU'RE WELCOME I HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK BYE
UH I HAVE WORKED WITH WATER
THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES
THAT TWO OF THEM ARE OUTSIDE AND TWO OF 'EM ARE INSIDE SOMEWHERE
UM UH I DON'T KNOW
THEY ARE LOW UH THE TEMPERATURE IS LOW
UM THAT FROM CUP A AND B THEY ARE REALLY HIGH TEMPERATURE
THERE IS ZERO WATER LOSS SO THAT MEANS LIKE IT THERE'S STILL WATER IN THERE
UH LIKE PLACES
I'M NOT SURE I DIDN'T REALLY LEARN ABOUT THAT
MAYBE IN THE JUNGLE IT RAINED A LOT AND UM
THERE IS A FAN AND IT'S IT'S TURNING AROUND THERE'S A CUP IN FRONT OF IT
MAYBE IT'S LOSING EVAPORATION FROM THE AIR
TWENTY SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
MARNIE I HAVE TO GO BYE
IT GOES DOWN THE HILL REALLY FAST I GUESS
AND IT'S DOING IT LIKE A CYCLE
NO BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE JUST DID EXCEPT WE DIDN'T HAVE WATER FLOWING FLOATING
MAYBE UM WE YOU ADD WATER AND THEN SINCE THE BLADE LIKE
MAYBE THE WA THE WHEEL TURNS AND MAKES THE WATER WORK
UH E THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM THINKING THAT WATER THAT I POUR WATER AND THEN ALSO THE WATER FLOWING HELPS THE WHEEL
E STRAW HELPS IT MOVE IN CIRCLES
UH POUR WATER
THE WA WATER WHEEL STARTED TO SPIN
WELL THIS IS THE LAST TIME SEEING YOU I WILL MISS YOU A LOT BYE
WHAT THE PENDULUM HAD TO IT TO MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WELL I KNOW THIS WAS THE SHORTER THE STRING THE MORE THE FASTER THE SWINGS
IT DIDN'T CHANGE BECAUSE WE WOULD BE CHANGING MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
YOU MAY WANT TO USE CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT BECAUSE THEN YOUR YOUR ANSWERS WILL WON'T BE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW
THEM
SHOWING HOW THEY WORKED
PERHAPS HE CAN ALSO DO THAT THEY CAN SHOW HOW
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS THE GRAPH IS SHOWING
HOW IT WORKS
THAT IS BECAUSE THE STRING HAS LESS OF A DROP THEREFORE HAS MORE POWER THE CYCLES
WHERE I FIND INFORMATION IS HOW FAR DOWN THE
WHAT I OBSERVED IS THAT THE BIGGER THE STRING THE LESS CYCLES IT HAS
WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN TEST EACH ONE
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THE LENGTHS ARE DIFFERENT THE CYCLES ARE ALSO DIFFERENT
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LIFEBOATS
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN TESTING DIFFERENT CENTIMETERS OF BOATS TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MANY PENNIES EACH BOAT CAN HOLD
WHAT THING HAPPENED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT WAS WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE THE LENGTH OF THE CUP
WELL WITH THAT IS THIS ONE DID THAT SO WE WON'T GET DIFFERENT RESULTS
HOW FAR THE BOAT WILL GO DOWN
WHAT I GUESS WILL HAPPEN IS THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THE NUMBER OF PENNIES THAT OR PASSENGERS THAT CAN HOLD WOULD
WHAT HAPPENS IS
WHAT WE THINK ABOUT IS HOW WE'VE GOING TO MAKE THE BOATS
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE BOAT WILL TIP
WHY IT HELD MORE IS BECAUSE THE THE PENNIES ARE CENTERED AND NOT ALL AROUND THE THERE AREN'T TOO MANY TO ONE SIDE
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS YOUR EXPERIMENT WON'T GET OUT OF HAND SO HA YOU HAVE SIMILAR RESULTS TO COMPARE
WHAT IT WILL
IT AFFECTED IT BY THE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS THAT WERE PUT IN
THE VARIABLES THAT WE DECIDED TO KEEP CONSTANT WERE THE
THE THINGS THAT WE DECIDED TO KEEP CONSTANT WERE THE WATER SO IT WASN'T TOO ROCKY
T WE KNEW WAS THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT THEY EACH HELD
WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS SEEING HA SEEING
WHEN DIFFERENT SIZED BOATS WILL HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
YES BUT ONLY WITH THE PENDULUMS
THE VARIABLE WE CHANGED WAS THE SIZE OF EACH BOAT
E PUT THE CAPACITY WAS NEXT WAS NEXT TO
WHERE I GRAPH CAPACITY IS THE Y IS THE X AXIS
IT TELLS ME
E IT TELLS ME WHAT WHAT I DID BEFORE IS AT THE X AXIS
NEXT TO IT EXACTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS
O WHAT I FIGURED OUT WAS THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN
THE CAPACITY WAS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
P NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THE BOAT CAN FIT
THE THINGS THAT I OBSERVE ARE THEY CAPACITY AND THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IT WILL FIT
WHAT IS UP IS BECAUSE THE CUP EACH CUP HAS DIFFERENT CAPACITY THAT IS DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF PASSENGERS THAT CAN FIT IN
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS PRACTICING WITH LIFEBOATS OR WELL THEY'RE REALLY PLASTIC COATED CUPS
I CONNECT TO IT BY SEEING HOW THE BOATS WILL DO
E GRAPH ON THE X AXIS
WHERE THEY'RE PUT IS THE Y AXIS
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT IS THINGS THAT CAN'T BE COUNTED OR CHANGED OVER TIME
CHANGE OVER UM IF THERE IS A CHANGE
WHAT I CAN FIGURE OUT IS THE CAPACITY AND THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
WHAT I OBSERVED IS IT SHOWS
NUMBER WHAT I SEE IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS RISE
THE INFORMATION IS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE
THE INFORMATION IS THE INDEPENDENT THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE
THE THINGS WE CAN PLOT ARE HOW MANY PASSENGERS WERE THERE
THE THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE
THE CHANGE IN NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
HOWEVER I PREDICTED IT WOULD BE ADD FOUR TO EACH ONE
I THINK IT MIGHT HOLD ONE HUNDRED FIVE
MAYBE SIXTY
SOMETHING THAT COULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND SOMETHING WELL IT HAD SOMETHING TO HOLD
UM WELL LIKE BOATS WITH LIKE HOW LONG IT COULD LAST IN WATER WITH WHEN YOU PUT PENNIES IN IT
SOMETHING YOU CAN WELL SOMETHING YOU CAN FLOAT ON IN THE WATER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE SWIM
WELL LIKE BOXES OF STUFF PEOPLE AND SOME PETS MAYBE
PLASTIC CUPS
THAT IT COULD STILL HOLD STUFF BUT IT WASN'T AS BIG SO IT COULD FLOAT TOO
YOU COULD DO A EXPERIMENT AND MAKE SEE LIKE HOW MUCH PEOPLE COULD HOLD ON THE BOAT
IT WOULD AFFECT YOUR RESULTS BY UM LIKE
WELL IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD IT WOULD JUST SINK
PUT IT IN LOW IT WOULD
IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IT IS HE KIND OF HE HEAVIER THE WHEN IT GETS BIGGER IT GETS I THINK HEAVIER SO IT COULD HOLD MORE STUFF
THE MORE YOU PUT THE MORE PENNIES YOU PUT IN IT SINKS SOME MORE
YEAH SO IT
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
WE USED LIKE WE USED LIKE WE KIND OF USED LIKE WE USED THE PENNIES AND STUFF
UH WELL WELL FEW DID IT WELL
IT AFFECTS IT BY LIKE
YOU HAVE THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE
SO IT COULD BE THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE SO PEOPLE CAN GET THE SAME RESULTS THEY'RE NOT DIFFERENT
UH WE ARE N WELL WE JUST FINISHED SCIENCE AND NOW WE'RE DOING WELL WE WERE DOING BOATS
UM I THINK YOU JUST ASKED THAT QUESTION
THE X IS THE NUMBER OF
AND THE Y IS NUMBER NO WAIT THE WAIT
X IS THE CAPACITY OF THE
AND Y IS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
YOU GRAPH THEM BY TENS AND TWENTIES AND OR FIVE AND TENS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHAT'S AN INDEPENDENT UM SOMETHING
THEY SHOW YOU THEY SHOW YOU THEY SHOW YOU THE LIKE OF THE NUMBERS OF STUFF
OR THE LIKE YEAH
THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING AND HOW BIG SOMETHING IS OR SMALL
UM I'M I DON'T KNOW IT'S KIND OF CONFUSING
YOU CHANGE THE LIKE WEIGHT OR SOMETHING OR THE LIKE HOW BIG IT IS AND THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND STUFF
YEAH I DID MMM
UH THE NUMBER OF CHANGE MAKES IT LIKE SINK DOWN
THE BOATS GET BIGGER AND THE MORE PAS THE BIGGER THE BOAT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS
IT D AS THE CAS CAPACITY DECREASES SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
AS THE CAPACITY DECREASES SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
IT SHOWS THE MILLIMETERS AND THE PASSENGERS OF THE THE THE BOATS
IT GOES STRAIGHT TO THE G THE THE GREEN LINE
YOU MAKE 'EM BIGGER SIZE YOU MAKE 'EM A BIGGER SIZE AND THEN IT GETS THE MORE MILLIMETERS OF STUFF AND THEN IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER
UM I THINK ABOUT LIKE FIFTY TWO
THEY KEEP IT IN ORDER AND STUFF SO IT DOESN'T GET ALL CONFUSING AND LINE IT UP
AND KEEP IT THE PENNIES IN LIKE THE MIDDLE
UM KEEP THE PENNIES IN THE MIDDLE AND DO IT CAREFULLY NOT REALLY HARD
AND THE THE BIGGER THE BOATS THE THE MORE PENNIES THEY GET AND THE SMALLER THE BOAT THE LESS
UH LIKE YOU COULD KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING WAS AND STUFF
UM I UM
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
UM WAIT WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
M I I I'VE IT'S TIME TO GO NOW SO BYE
R WE JUST FINISHED THE CONSTITUTION AND NOW WE'RE DOING UM PENDULUMS
THEY'RE ABOUT SOMETHING
IT HAS A PENNY AT THE END SO IT CAN LIKE BE A LITTLE HEAVIER
YOU LIKE YOU CAN HOLD IT UP AND THEN IT GOES LIKE BACK AND FORTH THEN
IT'S IT'S GOING BACK AND FORTH EACH TIME AND THEN IT GOES BACK UP WHERE IT WAS AT BEFORE
UH PUT SOMETHING MORE HEAVIER AT THE BOTTOM
THE RELEASE POINT THE PENCIL AND THE STRING
IT'S GETTING HELD BY A PENCIL
UM IF IT GETS BUMPED BY SOMETHING
YOU CAN CHANGE THE END OR THE WEIGHT OF SOMETHING THE THING
THERE ARE MORE PENNIES AT THE END OF THE PAPERCLIP
THE STRINGS ARE LONGER
WE ADDED MORE MASS ON TO IT AND WE GOT LONGER STRINGS
IT UM
UH TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE TO IT
YOU SHOULD DO WHAT THE TEACHER OR THE GROUP SAYS CAUSE IT CAN MESS UP THE PROJECT WELL THE EXPERIMENT IF YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT
UH WE GOT A LONGER PIECE OF STRING WE PUT UM ONE MORE PENNY ON IT
WE'LL LOOK AT A BOOK OR SOMETHING AND LOOK OR WE LOOK AT A PIECE OF PAPER AND SEE HOW THEY DID IT SO WE CAN DO WHAT THEY DID
NO THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE EVEN IF IT GOT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE SWING
UM TODAY WE STARTED LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
IT'S WHEN YOU CHANGE ON UH IT'S WHEN YOU CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT BY CHANGING ONE THING
TODAY WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO AN EXPERIMENT BUT WE STARTED LEARNING ABOUT WHAT A VARIABLE IS
IT SWUNG DOWN AND AND SWUNG BACK UP INTO PLACE
AN EXPERIMENT IS WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN BY DOING IT
IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH REPEATEDLY
UM I COULD CHANGE THE WEIGHT OF THE OBJECT THAT'S SWINGING
I CAN FIGURE OUT THE PARTS OF A PENDULUM OR WHAT COULD BE A PENDULUM
WOULD AFFECT IT BY UM SWINGING HIGHER OR LOWER
I COULD CHANGE THE PIECE THAT HOLDS THE PART THAT SWINGS
I NOTICED THAT EACH THAT THE TWO FARTHEST TO THE RIGHT ARE LONGER
THE BOB COULD BE A VARIABLE THE BOB COULD BE A VARIABLE BECAUSE OF IT'S WEIGHT
IT KEEPS GETTING HEAVIER AS IT GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
I NOTICE THAT ON EACH RELEASE WHEN I TRY THAT IT EACH ENDS UP AS THIRTEEN SWING CYCLES
IT'S A VARIABLE BECAUSE YOU COULD START IT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON VARIABLES WITH LIFEBOATS
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T USE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES
IF THERE'S TOO MUCH WEIGHT IT WILL SINK
UM I CHANGED THE DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT
HOW MUCH WATER AND THE WE USED THE SAME BOATS
THEY DON'T EFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE EXPERIMENT
THE SIZE OF THE BOAT IS BEING CHANGED
I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
THE UM THE EASIER IT WILL STAY UP
I FIGURED OUT THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS THAT THERE ARE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY TO SINK
WELL YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE
ONE OF THEM IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ONE OF THEM IS THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS AND ONE OF THEM IS EIGHTEEN
WELL WE ONLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME AND THE FIRST THING WE CHANGED WAS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
WELL WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE T WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE IF THEY ALL END AT THE SAME TIME THEN YOU'LL GET BETTER ANSWERS
THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE THINGS AND THEY CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING IN THIS EX EXPERIMENT
WELL IF YOU CHANGED THE HEIGHT OF WHERE YOU DROP IT YOU'LL GET
UM YOU'LL GET BETTER RESULTS
AND ON THE TWENTY IT'S THE SMALLEST
YOU FIND IT IN THIS THE Y AXIS AND THE Z AXIS
THE LENGTH OF UM YOU CAN FIND IT ON THE LENGTH OF CENTIMETERS AND THE NUMBER OF CYCLES
OH WELL THEN THE Y AXIS
UM I SEE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND SOME WIRES
ONE SIDE'S ON THE UM NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE SIDE'S ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
WELL WE HAD THE LIGHT BULB LIKE RIGHT THERE LIKE PUTTING IT RIGHT THERE
UM YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE UM WIRE AND PUT IT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND PUT THE LIGHT BULB RIGHT THERE AND THEN IT WILL LIGHT
UM IT NEEDS TO LIKE BE IN A CERTAIN PLACE SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET IN
WELL UM IT SOMETIMES WORKS WHEN IT'S ON THE GLASS PART AND THE METAL PART SO IT WORKS LIKE BOTH WAYS
THE BOTTOM
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO TOUCH IT TO THE SIDE
UM YEAH MMM HMM
I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT SO THE ELECTRICITY COULDN'T GET IN THROUGH
IT GIVES YOU ENERGY AND LIKE ELECTRICITY
THE UM LIGHT IS LIKE GETTING WARMER SO IT LIKE LIGHTS UP
YES I ALMOST GOT BURNT
UM THE BOTTOM OR THE SIDE BECAUSE THE BOTTOM HAS THE CIRCUIT AND SO DOES THE SIDE
ON THE UM NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE
UM WAIT YES I DO BECAUSE WELL I'M NOT SURE
WELL I THINK THE POSITIVE SIDE IS WORKING SO IT'S GOING AROUND AND INTO THE CIRCUIT
WELL UM N MMM
BECAUSE UM IT'S BY TH THE UM IT'S CONNECTED WITH THE POSITIVE SIDE I MEAN THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THE UM CIRCUIT ISN'T WORKING CAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
THE ENERGY WOULD BE UM WELL IT CAN KINDA GO TWO WAYS NOW IT CAN GO UP INTO AND THEN AROUND
WELL I THINK IT MIGHT BE GOING TWO WAYS INTO THIS SIDE AND THEN UP
UM A LIGHT BULB A UH BATTERY OR A D CELL AND A WIRE
WELL IT'S LIKE GETTING ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IN IT AND COMING UP
SO I THE ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN GO UP THROUGH IT TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
UM THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
UM BECAUSE IT GETS T WARM AND JUST HA LIGHTS BECAUSE YEAH
UM WELL UM YOU'D
UM BECAUSE THE PENCIL ISN'T THAT HEAVY YOU CAN EASILY PICK IT UP MAYBE EVEN START WITH FIVE
YOU WERE MEASURING THE PENCIL AND SEE HOW MILLIMETERS IT WAS
MILLILITER I MEAN MILLILITER ACTUALLY
YEAH NOT A MILLIMETER UM
UM I HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE BUT I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT IT IS
NO IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE THE TRUCK WOULD LIKE HAVE SOME BUMPS AND SHAKE IT AROUND A LITTLE
UM HOW MUCH LIQUID IT IS
YEAH THE OTHER PART IS AIR
YUP THAT MAKES IT THREE SEVENTY
TWENTY MILLILITERS IS THREE SEVENTY
OF AI OF TWENTY MILLILITERS OF AIR MAKES IT THREE SEVENTY
UM A FULL CUP AND LIKE
A LIKE TWO THIRDS OF A CUP
OKAY UM YES UM WE DID TEMPERATURE
UM WELL WE DID WATER HEAT AND WATER COLDNESS
UM WHAT THEIR TEMPERATURE IS
AND THEN YOU FIND ER FIND OUT WHICH R WHICH R IT REALLY IS AND
UM BECAUSE YOU'D THINK THAT LIKE THE LAST ONE BECAUSE A AND C WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE
IT WAS I IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT
I I WE YEAH UM IT WAS PRETTY MUCH
UM IT UH
UM ACT UH IT
UH I'M GONNA SAY IT GOES DOWN
OR I DON'T KNOW REALLY
UM A IS TWENTY DEGREES
UM I'M
AND C IS ALSO TWENTY DEGREES
PROBABLY A AND C
IT'S GOING DOWN SO HEAT MAKES IT GO UP
IT STARTS TO BUBBLE
UM IT'S ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND IT'S VERY HOT YOU COULD BURN E IT COULD BURN YOUR FINGER
IF IT'S LIKE BOILING AND YOU PUT YOUR FINGER IN YOU'D BURN IT
IT'S FREEZING IF YOU PUT YOUR FINGER FINGER IN I IT IT WOULD YOUR FINGER WOULD BE SO COLD
UH WHAT
WE YOU WOULD ALSO USE IT UM WELL ACTUALLY MY DAD COOKS MORE
I'D SAY IT'S LIKE WOULD BE REALLY HOT
DEGREES CELSIUS
WHY YEAH BECAUSE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED
UM NOT REALLY MUCH BUT I'D SAY YES AND NO
I'D LI I'VE LIKED UM PRETTY MUCH IT BEING MATH I LOVE MATH
YEP
UM THE UM I'D SAY THE LENGTH
YEAH YEAH
AND MILIMETERS I THINK ARE EVEN SMALLER THAN CENTIMETERS
UH I'D SAY IT WOULD BE A METER STICK
UM THE LITTLE ONES OR THE
YOU ALSO CAN USE INCHES TO S MEASURE SMALL THINGS
NO JUST TO LIKE MEASURE SOMETHING
UM NOT REALLY
I'D PROBABLY USE UM A METER STICK OR MEASURING TAPE
UM BECAUSE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY KNOW HOW LONG THE STRAW IS
NO UNLESS YOU KNOW THE HEIGHT OF THE THE STRAW
WHAT UM
I'M VERY RA I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT ESTIMATING REALLY
NO I JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE ME ESTIMATING
GRAMS ARE UM A BALANCE NOT A BALANCED ITEM A STANDARD UNIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO MEASURE STUFF
THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS THERE ARE ONE GRAM PIECES FIVE GRAM PIECES TEN GRAM PIECES AND TWENTY GRAM PIECES
STANDARD IS AN AGREED ON OBJECT TO MEASURE WITH
NO MISS BUCK CHOSE IT OUT BUT WE WERE ALL OKAY WITH IT
AN ESTIMATE IS GUESSING HOW MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS
YEAH LIKE IF IT'S FULL OR IF IT HAS NOTHING IT IN YEAH
I WAS PRETTY GOOD I GOT A FEW OFF ON MOST OF EM
UM I DON'T THINK SO UM YEAH MY ERASER WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN UM GRAMS
YEAH I HELD AND I'M LIKE OKAY I THINK THIS IS EIGHT GRAMS BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE SEVEN YEAH
YES WE DID WE HAD CUPS AND WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THE VOLUME OF THE CUP
WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY STANDARD UNIT TO USE
NO WE DIDN'T AGREE ON EM WE WERE LIKE THESE AREN'T THE SAME SIZE
FINDING OUT IF YOU ALL USE THE SAME SIZE TUBE THEY USUALLY ARE STANDARD UNITS
UM METERS WE USED METERS AND CENTIMETERS
I FORGET LET'S SEE
YOU COULD FIND THE VOLUME OF A CUP YOU COULD FIND THE VOLUME OF HMM
YOU COULD FIND AN ORANGE JUICE CONTAINER OR A YOGURT CONTAINER
YES WE USED THE METRIC SYSTEM
A LITER IS A HUNDRED UM
OH GOSH NOW I'M GETTING CONFUSED
MILLA AND THEN LITER MILLA IS FOR SOMETHING SMALLER
IT WAS A LITTLE PART OF A METER
WE HAD ONE OF THESE AND WE GO TO TAKE IT AND FILL IT UP TO LIKE THE TWENTIETH POINT AND THAT'S REALLY ALL
WHATEVER NUMBER THAT YOU FILL IT UP TO THAT THAT'S HOW MANY OF THESE GO INTO THAT NUMBER
WE FOUND OUT THAT TEN HUNDRED UM MILLILITERS FIT INTO ONE LITER
YEAH A THOUSAND
WELL WAIT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
I THINK I COULD USE IT IN A BUNCH OF STUFF I COULD USE IT
I'M NOT SURE AT LEAST TWELVE FEET LONG
FURNITURE CARPETING I'M NOT SURE JUST A BUNCH OF STUFF
I'M NOT SURE I THINK WE JUST DID IT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE COLORFUL AND FUN
I'M NOT SURE I DON'T THINK SO
LET'S SEE TEN WE HAD TO COLOR IT TEN TIMES SO WE NEEDED IS A HUNDRED
UM I'M NOT SURE
MAYBE SHE WENT AROUND THE SCHOOLYARD PRETTY BY TO THAT YEAH
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE FUN
YEAH I'VE NOTICED THEM OFTEN
THAT WHEN IT HAD WATER IN IT IT WAS HEAVIER THAN WHEN IT DIDN'T
NO WE HAD A DRY SPONGE BUT THEN WE GOT THAT SPONGE WET
JUST UM WEIGHING AND STUFF
MMM HMM YEAH
YEAH MMM HMM
UM WAIT LET ME RE
UM BECAUSE
IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS OR
NO BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS COULD BE A DIFFERENT SIZE LIKE MINE COULD BE SMALL AND YOURS COULD BE BIG
UM THE SIDE WITH THE WA WITH THE UM SPONGE UM WILL GO DOWN
BECAUSE IT'S HEAVIER THAN TWO GRAMS
BECAUSE YEAH BUT IT IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S M IT'S WATER IN IT SO IT ADDS MORE MASS TO IT
WE JUST PUT MORE GRAMS IN AND STUFF
WELL IT SURPRISED ME THAT UM IT WEIGHED SO MUCH WHEN IT HAD WATER IN IT COMPARED TO WHEN IT HAD ONLY A LITTLE BIT A WATER IN IT
AND THEN THAT IT'S LIKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE THE WATER AND THE SPONGE MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE
YEAH THERE'S PROBABLY STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WATER IN IT
UM WELL BECAUSE THERE'S YOU CAN'T GET ALL THE WATER OUT WHEN YOU SQUEEZE THE SPONGE THERE'D STILL BE A LITTLE BIT LEFT
UM WE COULD WRING IT OUT SOME MORE AND THERE'D PROBABLY STILL BE SOME DRIPS OF WATER YEAH
UM IT WOULD PROBABLY WEIGH A LITTLE BIT LESS
BECAUSE UM A LOT OF THE WATER IS GONE OUT SO UM SO IT WOULDN'T WEIGH AS MUCH
UM AS WHEN THERE WAS THE UM WATER IN THE WET SPONGE
THAT UM IT ADDS A LOT TO ANYTHING YEAH YEAH
WELL WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING THINGS LIKE UM
WE LIKE UM SAW HOW HEAVY OR LIGHT IT WAS
UM NO WE HAVE LIKE A BALANCE A SCALE
YEAH YEAH
UM NO BECAUSE THIS WAS A WHILE AGO YEAH
UM WET NO DRY I MEAN
UM AND THEN WE GOT IT WET AND THEN WE MEASURED IT IN GRAMS AGAIN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED
UM HOW HEAVY THE SPONGE WAS WITH WATER
UM IT MADE IT VERY HEAVY
YEAH UM FORGOT HOW WE DID THAT
DRY SPONGE OH YEAH
UM WELL
YESTERDAY NO THAT'S NOT WEIGHING
WELL WE WEIGHED LIKE SCISSORS AND PENCILS AND CRAYONS WITH GRAMS
UM NOT REALLY
MMM HMM WELL
WE REALLY DIDN'T FIGURE OUT ANY WAY BUT
UM WE STARTED USING GRAMS MMM HMM
OH YEAH BUT ONE TIME WE UM SAW HOW MUCH GRAVEL COULD EQUAL ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
MMM HMM YEAH
I DON'T THINK WE DID THAT WE WED DID WITH THAT WITH THE PAPER CLIPS BUT WE DIDN'T DO IT WITH ANYTHING ELSE
WELL LIKE WHEN WE WERE GONNA WEIGH THE PENCIL WE FIRST ESTIMATED HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND THEN WE WEIGHED IT
WITH THIS WITH THE PENCIL PAPER WE DID I WAS KIND OF OFF ON ALL OF EM
CAUSE WE UM WEIGHED LIKE A MAKER AND I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE LIKE EIGHTY FIVE AND IT WAS ACTUALLY ONLY LIKE FIFTY
IT WOULD PROBABLY WEIGH MORE
I BET THEY USED DIAPERS BECAUSE SHE HAS A NEW BABY IT'S NOT REALLY NEW BUT I THINK IT WAS BORN LIKE MAYBE A COUPLE
AT THE BEGINNING WE DID WEI WE WEIGHED WITH PAPER CLIPS
MMM HMM LIKE THE WATER THAT COMES OUT OF THE SINK WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
UM IT WAS LIKE TWENTY SIX DEGREES
WE LIKE PUT A THERMOMETER IN THERE AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
THERE'S NUMBERS ON IT AND UM YOU CAN TELL BY WHERE THE LITTLE RED LINE IS
IT MOVES UP OR DOWN UM ACCORDING TO HOW LIKE HOT OR COLD IT IS
W THAT UM IT STARTS LIKE WHEN IT GETS WARMER IT STARTS SPREADING OUT AND SO IT THE F PRESSURE MOVES IT UP
UM MAYBE HALF A MINUTE
WE JUST KIND OF CAN TELL WHEN
UH-HUH YEAH MMM HMM
MMM HMM TWENTY SIX
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT UM THE ICE CUBES COOLED DOWN THE WATER BUT THEN THEY STARTED TO MELT SO IT GOT WARMER AND WARMER
MMM HMM YEAH
UM BEFORE WE PUT THE ICE IN
YEAH UM
WE JUST MEASURED IT AGAIN UM WE'D PUT LIKE WHAT THE NEXT NUMBER WAS
UM I THINK IT WENT DOWN TO LIKE TWELVE AND THEN EIGHT
MMM HMM YOU'D LIKE FIND WHERE TWELVE IS AND THEN PUT THE DOT RIGHT WHERE
IT WAS EIGHT DEGREES AND SO WE'D PUT THE DOT THERE AGAIN
UM WE CONNECTED ALL THE LINES
UM YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGE YOU CAN SEE HOW IT GETS HOTTER OR COLDER
THAT IT WAS REALLY WARM THEN IT GOT COLDER AND IT STAYED THE SAME
BECAUSE IT'S TWENTY TWO UP THERE THEN IT GOES THEN YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE IT GOES DOWN TO FIVE
UM IT YOU COULD JUST TELL BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT USUALLY MEANS THAT IT'S COLDER
TEMPERATURE IS LIKE HOW WHAT HOW HOT OR COLD IT IS MMM HMM
CELSIUS IS JUST A DIFFERENT TYPE TO UM SEE HOW HOT OR COLD IT IS THERE'S FAHRENHEIT AND CELSIUS YEAH
YEAH UM IT'S PART OF THE METRIC SYSTEM NOT THE STANDARD
WELL IT IT IT'S JUST UM
MAYBE MAYBE WARMER THOUGH
WELL IT'S KINDA COLD THOUGH YEAH
YEAH BUT THEN WHEN IT'S TWENTY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS IT'S KIND OF WARM
YEAH UH-HUH
ONE HUNDRED IS LIKE WHAT IT IS WHEN IT'S LIKE SUMMER TIME AND STUFF LIKE REALLY WARM BOILING
IT'S UM IT'S LIKE FREEZING
UM YOU'D NE UM ZERO DEGREES
ONE HUNDRED DEGREES YEAH
I THINK IT WAS LIKE TWENTY SIX OR SOMETHING
YEAH MMM HMM YEAH MMM HMM YEAH MMM HMM
IT WAS WARMER AND THEN IT GOT COLDER
UM IT GOT COLDER MMM HMM
UM I KNOW FIFTEEN PLUS FIVE EQUALS TWENTY SO MMM HMM
YEAH WE DID THAT YESTERDAY MMM HMM
UM IT ACTUALLY GOT UM HOTTER IT WAS KIND OF IT GOT A LITTLE HOTTER
I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY MMM HMM
MMM HMM YEAH
MMM HMM YEAH MMM HMM
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MAYBE LIKE I THINK IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SOMETHING
IT'S KIND OF IN BETWEEN FIVE AND FIFTY
MMM HMM YEAH
HI YEAH HOWDY YEAH
MMM HMM OKAY
WELL WE STUDIED ABOUT OH LET ME THINK
UM YEAH WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THAT NOW MMM HMM
UM WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT LIKE KILOMETERS AND METERS AND
DECIMETERS AND STANDARD UNITS
UM WE USED THE MEASURE TAPES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
IT WELL IT'S A METER WHICH IS LIKE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
MMM HMM YEAH MMM HMM AND THEN WE GOT TO COLOR IT
MMM HMM I DID DIFFERENT COLORS LIKE RED YELLOW BLUE GREEN THEN MY FOUR LAST ONES HAD BLACK POLKA DOTS ON EM
MMM HMM YEAH
MMM HMM YEAH
UM I THINK IT WAS LIKE THREE OR SOMETHING
WELL NO WE HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF STRAWS BUT WE EACH HAD OUR OWN STRAW AND SOME OF EM WERE SHORT AND OTHERS WERE LONGER
YEAH YEAH THAN ANOTHER GROUP'S
WE GOT WE UM CAME OUT WITH DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS BECAUSE SOME GROUPS HAVE HAD SHORTER STRAWS THAN OTHER GROUPS
MMM HMM YEAH FEET AND INCHES AND CENTIMETERS
YEAH YEAH
UM I DON'T KNOW NO
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH
UM WE PRACTICED UM POUNDS AND STUFF
BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN ON BOTH SIDES YEAH
MMM HMM YEAH YEAH UM A SCALE WE HAD YEAH
UM IF THE SIDES WERE EVEN
UM NO
I DON'T KNOW YEAH
UM WE WEIGHED LIKE A METAL DISC AND A PLASTIC DISC AND A LITTLE SQUARE OF WOOD
UH-HUH UH-HUH YEAH UM JUST A PLAIN LIKE RED DISC
THAT MEANS THEY WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER THINGS WEIGH
UM THE METAL DISC
YEAH WE WERE IN GROUPS YEAH
UM NO BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE UM HAD BIGGER PAPER CLIPS THAN OTHER PEOPLE
NO EXCEPT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME SHA UM SAME SIZE OF PAPER CLIP AS OTHER PEOPLE
UM WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR ANSWERS WERE THE SAME MAINLY
THAT THEY'RE REALLY NOT A STANDARD UM YOU REALLY CAN'T MEASURE WITH THEM NO
NO BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS COULD BE ANY DIFFERENT SIZE
UM NO
WE KINDA STOPPED BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING YEAH YEAH
UM WELL WE KINDA DID UM MEASUREMENT IN UM METERS AND CENTIMETERS
UM WE MEASURED OUR DESKS AND THINGS
WE UM
UM WELL UM A METER TAPE
UM THAT WAY YEAH YOU HAVE TO LIKE PUT IT IN THAT PLACE OR IT'S GONNA COME OUT WITH THE WRONG MEASUREMENT
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT LIKE RIGHT THERE AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO START RIGHT THERE IT WOULD BE LONGER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MMM A LITTLE BIT YEAH
THAT WE WERE ALL DIFFERENT HEIGHTS YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
UM YOU COULD BUT YOU'D HAVE TO SAY LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO CENTIMETERS
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER AND THEN THEN THERE THEN THERE'D BE THIRTY TWO CENTIMETERS LEFT SO IT'D EQUAL ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO CENTIMETERS
THAT UM THEY'RE PRETTY BY T UH-HUH
UH-HUH YEAH MMM KIND OF
UM MY NOSE AND MY EAR YEAH YEAH
I KINDA GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER YEAH
WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A METER BECAUSE A METER'S MUCH LONGER
UM TWENTY FIVE MAYBE MMM HMM
WE DO THAT WHEN WE DO PLAYS AND STUFF BUT YEAH
WELL WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF
N MMM DIFFERENT CUPS MMM HMM
YOU WOULD PUT THOSE IN THE CUP AND THEN YOU'D SE PUT GRAM PIECES IN AND LIKE SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
UM HOW MANY GRAM PIE GRAMS YOU PUT IN
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE ONCE WE TRIED USING PAPER CLIPS
ALL THE PAPER CLIPS WERE DIFFERENT SIZES
MMM THAT ONE GOT THE SAME THI UM N MMM
AND THEN WE DIVIDED TWENTY DA BY FIVE
WE A WHILE AGO WE WERE MEASURING THINGS WITH C CENTIMETERS
AND METERS N MMM
UM WE MADE A METER TAPE THING
MMM MMM HMM YEAH
MMM NOT REALLY ANYTHING
OH YEAH WE'RE MEASURING CAPACITY
WE IT'S LIKE
HOW MUCH WATER IS IN AN OBJECT OR HOW MUCH STUFF IS INSIDE OF AN OBJECT
FIFTY
YEAH FIFTY MILLILITERS
MMM I DON'T KNOW
MMM IT'S KINDA BORING MMM HMM
NO BECAUSE WE SQUIRTED OUT ALL THE EXTRA WATER WE SQUIRTED A LITTLE OUT SO IT WOULDN'T DRIP ALL ACROSS THE CLASSROOM
IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH LI MMM HMM
WE'RE UM
WE'RE MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF WATER IN CUPS
WE WOULD FIRST STICK OUR FINGER IN AND SEE WHICH ONE WE THINK IS WARMER AND THEN WE UM
MMM HMM WE STUCK THE THERMOMETER IN A AND IT SAID TWENTY
WE UM
UM GRAMS AND KILOGRAMS
A MINUTE BETWEEN EVERY ONE MMM HMM
THOSE WERE HOW MANY MINUTES IT TOOK
OH YEAH THE MINUTES WERE ON THERE UM THE HOW MUCH HOW MANY DEGREES CELSIUS IT IS
WELL YEAH MMM HMM
IT STARTED AT TWENTY TWO DEGREES BECAUSE THAT LINE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE TWENTY TWO
PROBABLY THE SAME AS THOSE TWO PROB
THREE DEGREES
PROBABLY THIRTEEN DEGREES
BELOW TWENTY THREE
IT'S UM IT'S AT ZERO
IT WA THERE WAS NO ICE IN IT
THAT'S ABOUT THAT FIRST ONE'S TWENTY DEGREES AND THEN THAT SECOND ONE'S ABOUT FOUR DEGREES
IT WENT DOWN LIKE THE DEGREES WENT DOWN
HE PUT IT IN COLDER WATER
WELL WE DIDN'T DO MATH YET MATH IS RIGHT AFTER THIS
LIKE GUESSING BUT LIKE A REASONABLE GUESS
N UH YEAH
A CENTIMETER IS LIKE ALMOST HALF AS BIG AS AN INCH
NO YEAH
A FILING CABINET A TABLE HOW TALL YOU ARE
HOW FAR IT IS FROM CALIFORNIA TO NEW YORK
YEAH MMM HMM
YOU PUT YOUR FINGER WHERE IT ENDS AND THEN BRING THE BOTTOM TO THERE
I KNEW THERE'D BE THAT BEFORE CLASS
YEAH UM PROBABLY READING
WELL WE WERE WEIGHING WITH THESE UM
THINGS SCALES
YEAH YEAH MMM HMM YEAH
MMM WE DIDN'T USE ANYTHING ELSE N MMM WE USED PAPER CLIPS LAST WEEK
ALL THE PAPER CLIPS WERE DIFFERENT SIZES SO WE COULDN'T GET THE RIGHT MEASUREMENT MMM HMM
WHEN THERE THERE'S A LINE ON THE TOP PART AND ON THE BOTTOM PART AND WHEN THEY'RE MATCHED LIKE THEY'RE STRAIGHT YEAH
MMM HMM YEAH MMM HMM
A PENCIL AND A MAGNET
MMM IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE IT WAS LIKE ELEVEN GRAMS
MMM TEN TWENTY
NO EXCEPT FOR A THE GRAVEL WE HAD TO PUT IN A HUNDRED GRAMS IN A BAG
UM THE WHOLE GROUP'S
I DON'T KNOW WE HAD TO DUMP IT BACK IN THE CUP SO
NAH UH WELL WE PUT IT IN A BAG AND THEN WE HAD TO SEE WHAT EQUALED A HUNDRED GRAMS AND WE GOT LIKE A BOOK AND STUFF
WELL THEY'RE BOTH THE SMALLEST IN THE METRIC MEASUREMENT
K MMM HMM YEAH
NO N MMM
THAT ONE BECAUSE IT'S LOWER DOWN
MMM NO MMM HMM
WELL IN SCIENCE WE'RE STUDYING ABOUT ANCIENT ROME
THEN IN MATH WE'RE STUDYING MEASUREMENT USING METERS DECIMETERS CENTIMETERS SO YEAH
WE WE WE G BEFORE WE USED THE GRAM PIECES LIKE WE USED PAPER CLIPS
WE HAD TO LIKE GET IF WE WERE DOING THAT WE HAD TO GET EVERY LIKE PAPER CLIP THE SAME SIZE IN ORDER TO DO IT
SO WE HAD TO LIKE FIND OUT WHAT IT WOULD BE STANDARD AND THEN WE'LL SA STAY THE SAME THE ALL THE TIME
WELL WE UM FOUND THE GRAM PIECES UM AND THAT'S ALL WE US SO FAR
THINK AT I FORGET I THINK IT WAS LIKE FIVE TWENTIES YEAH FIVE TWENTIES
WE HAD TO WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A HUNDRED GRAMS OF GRAVEL
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THEM
MAYBE WE WERE GOING TO LIKE GET IT AND LIKE UH MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF LIKE THAT'S LIKE A THOUSAND GRAMS OR SOMETHING
I GUESS IF YOU MADE IT EVEN AND ONE SIDE IS MORE LOWER IF YOU JUST PUT IN THAT THING IT WILL GET IT WILL M IT'LL COUNT IT AS MORE HEAVIER
YES AND THEN THE CUPS HAVE TO BE THE SAME THING BECAUSE IF ONE CUP HAS PAINT ON IT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T THE CUP WITH PAINT WOULD BE HEAVIER
YEAH YOU COULD SEE HOW MA HOW BIG THE MACHINE WOULD BE TO LIKE GET IT IN IN METERS
LIKE TO UM TO LIKE MAKE THE CAN
YEAH YES EXCEPT IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT E OVER THERE
YES WELL NO IT D WAS OVER HERE AND UH WE DID NOT FILL UP THIS AREA NO
YEAH THAT'S FIFTY YES AND THEN IT KEPT GOING FIFTY FIFTY TO HERE FIFTY TO HERE FIFTY TO HE
ESTIMATE IT FIRST YEAH
FORTY YEAH BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY DOING FROM THE BOTTOM TO B YEAH YEAH
MILLILITERS SO LIKE FILL UP TO D
FIFTY A HUNDRED
IT WOULD TAKE LIKE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS TO FILL UP THE WHOLE CUP YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WE'RE MEASURING LIKE HOW MUCH WA LIKE CAPACITY AND LIKE YEAH
OH THAT WOULD BE LIKE D IT YEAH E
UM CAPACITY YEAH
OH YEAH WE A THAT'S LIKE ON THREE D THINGS HOW TALL SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT SO YEAH
WELL YOU'RE FINDING OUT HOW MANY LIKE MILLILITERS IT COULD HOLD
WELL THIS ONE HAS THE WHOLE CAT CAT YEAH HOW DO YOU SAY THAT
I JUST FILL IT BUT NOT TO CAPACITY BUT JUST LIKE HALFWAY OR A LITTLE MORE
BECAUSE IF YOU LIKE FILL IT TO CAPACITY YOU COULD LIKE SPILL ADD A LITTLE MORE AND IT COULD S LIKE SPILL ALL OVER THE PLACE AND YOU COULD HAVE A LEAK
IF YOU'RE LIKE DOING A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT OR SOMETHING
YEAH SO
UM ONCE MAKING SALAD YEAH
WELL YEAH YEAH WHEN MY MOM WAS MAKING SOMETHING SHE USED A MEASURING CUP
NOT ALWAYS YEAH BUT IT IT SOMETIMES IS
WELL BECAUSE IT COULD THE INGREDIENTS OR WHAT YOU'RE MAKING NEED LIKE A LOT OF IT SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE TWO CUPS OR SOMETHING
YEAH IT'S LIKE A LITTLE LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE MILK CARTON CARTON SO YEAH THAT'S HOW MUCH IT WOULD'VE BEEN
LIKE ER UM ONE HUNDRED YEAH
YEAH EXCEPT OUR ONE'S DI DIDN'T GO UP TO A HUNDRED IT ONLY WENT UP TO FIFTY YEAH
UM NO NOT YET NO
WELL I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO LIKE TEN OF THESE TO EQUAL ONE LITER SO
WELL I SAW LIKE THIS ONE WILL HAVE ONE LITER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED SO
UM THIS WOULD BE LIKE OUR UH
YEAH ONE LITER YEAH
I SAY LIKE A THOUSAND
WELL I SEE LIKE UM MOST OF IT FILLED BUT NOT UP TO CA AH YES CAPACITY SO
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
MAYBE IT'S LIKE SHOWING HOW M MUCH IT COULD HOLD
LIKE THE CAPACITY IS BUT THEY DIDN'T FILL IT UP TO CAPACITY SO
YEAH IT WOULDN'T YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT
UM H THE HOW MUCH THAT THING COULD HOLD
THEN YOU COULD JUST LIKE PUT IN HALF OR A QUARTER SO YEAH
UM HI
HI
UM LIKE MEASURING HOW BIG OR WIDE SOMETHING IS
LIKE KILOMETERS HOW FAR A TRAIN COULD TRAVEL HOW FAR DOES LIKE TO GET FROM YOUR HOUSE TO THE SCHOOL SO
E I I WILL KNOW IF IF I LOOK OUT AND LIKE OPEN MY WINDOW TO SEE IF IT WAS COLD OR WARM YEAH
YES YEAH AROUND THAT SIZE
LIKE A CENTIMETER WOULD BE LIKE A THE AVERAGE SIZE OF YOUR PINKIE AND THEN LIKE A DECIMETER WOULD BE LIKE AN AVERAGE ADULT HAND
UM ONE HUN NO NO TEN
YES YEAH YES
UM YEAH ONE TIME I GOT IT EXACTLY RIGHT
I JUST LIKE LOOKED AT A T V GUESSED IT WAS LIKE HALF A METER AND THEN WELL T GOT THE M METER TAPE AND IT WAS FIFTY
YEAH YEAH
WE MEASURED LIKE UM
DOORS WINDOWS HOW TALL A PERSON WAS OR HOW BIG THEIR WAIST OR HEAD
YEAH YEAH
THAT MEANS LIKE THEY LIKE TAPED IT IN THE WRONG PLACE LIKE
LIKE BUT IF THEY HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH SEPARATED IT THEY WON'T GET THE EXACT ANSWER
WELL FIRST WE U WE GUESSED HOW BIG IT WOULD'VE BEEN AND THEN WE LIKE TOOK THE METER TAPE AND LIKE YEAH
YES SORT OF I LIKE SCIENCE MORE
YES UM A HUNDRED
HI ANDREW ANDREW
UM ABOUT UM TEN
TEN SO ONE WE ONE EACH COLOR ONE COLOR EACH EACH PART HALF
UM FIVE NO WAIT NO I DON'T KNOW
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
UM THE SIZE A AN AVERAGE SIZE OF YOUR PINKIE
AN ESTIMATE IS LIKE WHEN YOU GUESS HOW BIG OR WIDE SOMETHING IS
SO IT'S LIKE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS I THINK SO
YEAH WE LINED UP FROM SMALLEST TO TALLEST
YEAH AND THEN THE METERS TAPES LIKE THEY WEREN'T CONNECTED EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE AS EVERYBODY ELSE'S SO
YEAH THAT WE USED LIKE A ME A REAL METER TAPE THAT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE FOR EVERYTHING
NO WE'D WE WERE LA WE LAID ON THE FLOOR AND THEN THE PERSON LAID IT ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO US TO SEE WELL WE COULD USE THE WALL
NO MISS BALASCA DID THAT YEAH
EVERYTHING EVERY METER TAPE WOULD'VE BEEN THE SAME SIZE
AND BUT THEN LIKE WOULD IT WITH THE STRAWS IT COULD'VE BEEN LIKE W A LITTLE BIT OVER A HUNDRED
LIKE MAYBE LIKE UM WELL MAYBE THE STAND UP THE CAMERA IT COULD'VE BEEN A METER
I DON'T BELIEVE IT NO
YEAH BECAUSE LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WAS WAY SMALLER THAN A METER A METER WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE THAT BIG
OH THEN YEAH THAT MIGHT BE A METER OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE OR A LITTLE LESS
WELL I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT THAT LIKE I THOUGHT LIKE A METER WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE TEN CENTIMETERS BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY LIKE A HUNDRED YEAH
OH ONE CENT AND THEN ONE METER CENTIMETERS EH WA
HUNDRED OH OKAY
NO WELL WE MEASURED OUR HEIGHT BUT NOT LIKE OUR ARM SPAN
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE I FOUND LIKE THE MORE I ESTIMATED THE CLOSER I WAS TO THE REAL ANSWER
NO I THINK YOU SHOULD USE KILOMETERS
UM BECAUSE LIKE KILOMETERS IT WOULD'VE BEEN WAY BIGGER AND YOU COULD MEASURE A BIGGER SPACE QUICKER QUICKER
OR YOU COULD JUST USE UM METERS ON HOW BIG A DOOR WOULD'VE BEEN SO
YOU COULD USE KILOMETERS TO SEE HOW FAR YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL
YOU COULD UM USE METERS TO SEE HOW TALL YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
YOU COULD USE UM INCHES OR FEET TO SEE HOW BIG THE SPACE OF IT WOULD'VE BEEN
NOPE MAYBE L THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT FEET HOW LIKE HOW TO USE THE FEETS LIKE ONE FOOT OR TWO
WELL I GUESS IT'S DIFFERENT SO YOU COULD MEASURE BIGGER AREAS OR LIKE LONGER SPACES
UM MAYBE LIKE IT THINKS ABOUT LIKE ONE METER SO LIKE ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE HUMAN
YEAH TWENTY THIRTY YEAH
UM WE'VE BEEN DOING THE MASS OF SOME THINGS
UM I MEAN LIKE WEIGHING THINGS AND UM
BECAUSE THERE'RE JUST HOLES IN IT AND THE AND THE THINGS CAN'T JUST SIT IN IT
WE UM MEASURED THINGS FROM OUR DESK
UM YOU PUT THE PENCIL IN ONE CUP THEN YOU PUT THE GRAMS IN THE OTHER AND THEN YOU TRY TO SEE IF UM
YOU TRY TO SEE IF THEY'RE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER
UM THERE'S LIKE A LITTLE LIKE THING STICKING DOWN AND THERE'S A LITTLE LINE AND IF IT'S EQUAL WITH THAT E YEAH
NO YOU USE THEM TO MEASURE WEIGHT
IT WOULD ROCK WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING IN YOU PUT THE OTHER THING IN IT
UM LIKE IF IT'S LEANING THAT WAY THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S HEAVIER IF IT'S MOVING THAT WAY THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S HEAVIER
IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS
UM YEAH WE HAD TO PUT HUNDRED GRAMS IN THERE
SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY AND FOUR TEN GRAMS
WELL THE THE BIG BAG WAS REALLY HEAVY
PROBABLY DOING THE MASS OF THE OF THE SAND
UM WAIT WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN
UM THEY WERE CALLED GRAMS AND YOU PUT THEM IN ONE CUP AND YOU COMPARE IT TO ANOTHER THING
BY LOOKING AT THE LITTLE THING POINTING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE
WE'VE BEEN LIKE MEASURING IN METERS AND ESTIMATING IF SOMETHING'S LIKE A METER OR LIKE THIRTY CENTIMETERS
NO YEAH
UM CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS TAKE ABOUT LIKE TWO BECAUSE THE CUP WAS SO LIKE LITTLE
UM NO SO MY CLASSMATES GOT FOURTEEN
UM THEY MIGHT'VE HAD A BIGGER CUP
OR THEY HAD A SMALLER VIAL
NO BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZES AND THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD
UM A METER STICK
CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE ALL THE SAME LENGTH
UM YOU WOULD LIKE MEASURE THE HEIGHTH OF IT
IF YOU TOOK ABOUT
UH LIKE TEN OF THESE SCOOPS YOU WOULD FILL UP THIS AND THEN YOU WOULD POUR IT TO HERE AND IT WOULD BE AT ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
YEAH A HUNDRED YEAH A HUNDRED
NO YEAH
IT'S GOOD SO YOU CAN LIKE MEASURE THE HOW MUCH AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THE SIZE THEY'LL STILL BE THE SAME
I THINK THEY WOULD ONLY F PROBABLY FIT THREE OR FOUR
THEY'RE LIKE MOSTLY THE SAME THING
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST CALLED DIFFERENT THINGS
UM WE COULD DO IT WITH A DIFFERENT CUP BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY HOLD ABOUT TWO OR ONE MILLILITERS
WE EACH GOT A HALF OF A COOKIE
YEAH YEAH
WELL UM WE HAD PLUNGERS AND WE HAD A LITTLE CUP AND IT TOOK ABOUT THREE PLUNGERS TO FILL UP A CUP
UM THAT THERE'S A MILLILITER AND A PLUNGER
UM IT TELLS ME THAT IF I HAD A DIFFERENT SIZE CUP IT WOULDN'T BE THREE MILLIMETERS
UM BY FILLING UP THE CUP WITH PLUNGERS
ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED
UM WE POURED ONE IN AND IT WENT ABS EXACT UP TO THE LINE THEN WE PUT ANOTHER PLUNGER IN AND IT WENT EXACT UP TO THIS LINE
UM TELLS ME THAT THE PLUNGER IS ONE HUNDRED
UM ABOUT ONE HU UH FIFTY
THAT THIS CUP ALL TOGETHER EQUALED
FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED MILLIMETERS
THAT'S THE FOUR IT'S IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED CAUSE IT WENT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
THIS CUP CAN HOLD FIVE HUNDRED MILLIMETERS IN IT AND EACH LINE IS ONE HUNDRED MILLIMETERS
BECAUSE WE SH WE SQUIRTED UM ONE ONE PLUNGER AND IT EXACTLY EQUALED TO THAT LINE
YEAH SO WE UM
UH YEAH
SO WE GOT A BUCKET OF WATER AND THEN THE TEACHER PUT ICE IN IT
OH YEAH WE TOOK ITS TEMPERATURE
IT WAS TWENTY TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS
WE PUT ICE IN IT YEAH WE PUT ABOUT TEN THINGS TEN ICE CUBES
UM THAT UM
AFTER THE WE TOOK ITS TEMPERATURE AND IT WAS LIKE ZERO DEGREES
IT CHANGES A LOT
UM WHEN IT FEELS THE WATER JUST GOES RIGHT DOWN CAUSE IT KNOWS CAUSE IT CAN FEEL THE TEMPERATURE
THE THE ALCOHOL IN THE UM
YEAH YEAH
IT CHANGED NINETEEN DEGREES
WELL I MEAN CHANGED TWENTY DEGREES
THEN WE DID IT AGAIN LIKE WE DID IT EVERY MINUTE
WE MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE EVERY MINUTE
THEN IT WENT TO TWO
AND THEN IT WENT DOWN TO ZERO THEN IT LIKE WENT DOWN TO
I THINK ONE MINUS ONE
CAUSE THE ICE MELTED TO ON LIKE KEPT GOING UP AND LIKE AT THE END IT WENT LIKE BACK UP TO TWENTY CAUSE IT MELTED
BECAUSE IT'S NOT COLD AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ICE CUBES IN IT ANYMORE
UM WE PROBABLY SPENT ABOUT
UH IT PROBABLY TOOK TEN MINUTE I MEAN FOURTEEN MINUTES YEAH AND THEN WE HAD TO DRAW IT ONTO A GRAPH
UM WE DUMPED IT OUT NO WE TOOK THE TEMPERATURE RIGHT BEFORE WE DUMPED IT OUT
IT WAS PROBABLY AT TEN FORTY
UM PROBABLY LIKE THIRTY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE ALL DAY AND IT PROBABLY WAS GETTING HOT
WHEN IT SITS THERE THE HOT AIR IN THE CLASSROOM GOES INTO THE UM
INTO THE WATER AND THEN IT PUTS ALL THE COLD WA COLD AIR OUT SO THEN IT LIKE TURNS WARM
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT TWENTY AGAIN BECAUSE OVERNIGHT IT GETS A LITTLE COLD
UM BECAUSE IT WASN'T COLD ENOUGH
YOU'D HAVE TO PUT MORE ICE CUBES IN IT
UM LIKE ZERO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NUMBERS
TWENTY TWO
AT LIKE TWO THINGS
TWO LIKE GOING UP AND DOWN THINGS NO YEAH
THIS BECAUSE IT'S AT THE TWO RIGHT NOW
OH IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY THE TEMPERATURE
THESE ONES BECAUSE IT SAYS RIGHT THERE
UM THOSE ARE THE TEMPERATURES
BECAUSE IT HAS LIKE MINUS SIGNS AND IT SAYS TEMPERATURE
UM IT'S AT FIVE FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
THAT IT'S LIKE A RECTANGLE
UM JUST TO LIKE SIDES
UM THE LINE IS JUST LIKE
IT SHOWS YOU THE TEMPERATURE OF THE THINGS
UM THAT ONE'S JUST STRAIGHT BUT THIS ONE'S JUST LIKE CURVED
UM IT'S JUST IT WOULD JUST IT WOULD JUST BE GOING FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM
UM JUST SENT THE TURN RIGHT THERE
NO IT'S JUST STAYING THE SAME RIGHT HERE
UM TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU ADD ICE TO A CUP IT GETS COLDER
NO CAUSE IT MELTS AND THEN UM
AND THEN IT DO AND THEN IT MELTS AND THEN YOU'D KEEP HAVING TO PUT MORE ICE AND MORE ICE AND MORE ICE
HOW M HOW MANY ICE CUBES YOU HAVE
YEAH YEAH
YOU'RE FINDING OUT THAT UM
YOU'RE FINDING OUT
YEAH NO YOU'RE FINDING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS
UM YOU USE A METER OR CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
YEAH I G IT'S LIKE HOW IT GOES UP AND DOWN AND LIKE HOW TALL IT IS
LIKE UM
YEAH YOU WOULD FILL UP THE LITER
YEAH UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE IN CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND INCHES
WE S STARTED LEARNING ABOUT METERS
UM FOR HOMEWORK WE MADE UM A METER TAPE AND THEN WE MEASURED THINGS
WE WERE JUST USING LIKE LITTLE LIKE ROLLUP THINGS AND IT HA AND IT WAS A METER LONG
YEAH CAUSE WE DID LIKE THE LENGTH AND THE WIDTH OF OUR DESKS YEAH
EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THE STRAW SOME STRAWS WERE BIGGER AND SOME STRAWS WERE SHORTER
UM YOU JUST LIKE FOLD IT THE ONE WAY THEN YOU FLIPPED IT OVER THEN FLIPPED IT OVER AGAIN
THE SOME STRAWS WERE SHORT AND SOME STRAWS WERE BIGGER
IT TELLS ME THAT LIKE EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME LENGTH STRAW
UM LIKE A METER STICK
UM NO BECAUSE SOME CAN BE LIKE WOODEN SOME CAN BE PAPER AND SOME CAN YEAH
WE LEARNED ABOUT ESTIMATING LIKE WE WALKED AROUND
UH WE MADE A METER STICK OUT OF PAPER
I LEARNED THAT UM MOST THINGS THAT YOU MEASURE IS A METER
YEAH THEY W THEY WERE LIKE APART AND WE HAD TO CUT THEM OUT AND COLOR THEM AND PUT GLUE THEM TOGETHER
WE WERE COLORING THE LIKE CAUSE THEY THEY'RE DIFFERENT ROWS LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY AND YOU HAD TO COLOR THEM ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY ONE HUNDRED
SO IT'S JUST ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS EQUALS A METER
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
S UM TEN
YEAH WE CAN MEASURE LENGTH AND WIDTH TOO
UM YOU JUST YOU JUST DO TO ESTIMATE
NO I I WOULD SAY
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH
LIKE WE JUST LIKE MEASURE STUFF
YEAH IT'S IT F FEELS FUN YEAH
YEAH WE JUST LIKE ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM UP
EH WE JUST LIKE UM PUT SOME OF IT DOWN AND PUT IT SOME OF IT UP
MMM UH UM WE JUST LIKE WRITE HOW LONG IT IS DOWN
UM YEAH JUST JUST ONE BOOK JUST LIKE ONE RESEARCH BOOK
UH IT WAS TWENTY SEVEN POUNDS
I JUST FORGOT
UM NO I I FORGOT
UH LIKE G THIS S LIKE THIS LUNCH BASKET
A A PAPER RECYCLING BIN
WITH A PARTNER UH I FOR IT'S JUST WE JUST DO PARTNERS
UH IT FELT GREAT UH-HUH
I MADE IT UP I ACTUALLY I MADE IT UH BY A WORKSHEET AND A MATH SHEET
YEAH THE PIECE OF PAPER
UM ALL THE WAY TO THE HUNDRED
I DON'T KNOW
UH WE JUST DO IT TO STUFF THAT'S WEIGHS A HUNDRED
UH I FORGOT
IT LOOKED THE SAME EXCEPT IT HAS DIFFERENT COLORS ON IT
WELL SOMETIMES WE HAVE THE SAME COLORS BUT NOT ALL ON THE SAME SIZE WE JUST LIKE COLOR IT TOO
YEAH BEFORE YOU CUT
UH WELL HE'S WAY TALLER THAN ME
OH I JUST TALL
NO I DON'T KNOW UM I DON'T KNOW
HI HI
YUP AND HOW TALL THEY WERE
AND THEN WE MEASURED LIKE IN GRAMS HOW MUCH MA WATER IT PICKED UP
UH WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGHED
UM A SPONGE AND
WELL NO IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS WERE DIFFERENT SIZES
UM WELL IT'S BECAUSE THE LONGER ONES WEIGHED MORE AND THE SHORTER ONES WEIGHED LESS
YEAH OR JUST A BIG PROBLEM
UM GRAMS POUNDS OUNCES AND YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I FORGOT ACTUALLY I THINK IT WAS SIXTY GRAMS
THAT'S WHY SPONGES ARE VERY USEFUL
NO NOT REALLY YUP THAT WAS THE ONE THAT HAD ICE IN IT
ACTUALLY WELL ACTUALLY C I THOUGHT WAS LIKE MMM HOTTER THAN IT REALLY WAS
UM IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SAME AS UM MMM A
SO UM WHAT WAS I GONNA SAY
YUP WELL WE HAVEN'T USED ACTUALLY WE HAVE
WELL MMM IF THE WATER'S ALREADY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE IT'LL JUST STAY THE SAME
YUP AND ALSO IN FAHRENHEIT I THINK IT'S THIRTY TWO DEGREES
UM IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW
UM THEY'RE ALL IN MEASUREMENT AND THEY'RE ALL IN THE METRIC SYSTEM
YUP AND ALSO MMM AMERICAN'S DO USE IT SOMETIMES BUT NOT ALWAYS
LIKE MMM LIKE POUNDS AND THAT STUFF
I FORGOT OH
PROBABLY WAIT
UM WELL A KILOMETER WOULD BE A THOUSAND METERS NO BUT
UM PROBABLY LIKE THE OLYMPICS THEY USE LIKE THE HUNDRED MILLIMETER LIKE RACE SOMETHING LIKE THAT FORTY MILLIMETER
YEAH PROBABLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BECAUSE AND ALSO MMM KILO MMM KILO MEANS A THOUSAND
MILLIMETER I FORGOT WHAT THAT WAS
UM PROBABLY METERS AND
UM THEN PROBABLY I'D USE METERS AND UH
WELL A METER IS A HUNDRED UM GRAMS
GRAMS MILLIGRAMS OH CENTIMETERS
OR MAYBE FEET OR YARDS MAYBE
YEAH IT'D PROBABLY USE THE METRIC SYSTEM
YEAH THEY'RE LIKE HMM LIKE A YARD LIKE
YUP UM UH
WEIGHT OUNCES AND L LITERS
SO DOES IT START IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU TURN THE CAMERA ON
THEY CAN SOAK UP A LOT OF WATER IN WEIGHT ER LIQUID AND IT'S PRETTY AMAZING ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
UM THAT THE MASS EXPANDS WHEN UM IT SOAKS UP MORE MATTER
UM I DON'T KNOW LIKE
WELL NOT A IT WAS A PRETTY BIG IT WAS PRETTY BIG APPLE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GUESSING AND AND UH ESTIMATING WELL GUESSING IS JUST SAYING LIKE
WELL UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME ANOTHER QUESTION NOT NOT MUCH THAT I CAN SAY
YEAH YEAH
HI IS IT RECORDING GOOD
YOU CAN MEASURE THE HEIGHTH OF SOMETHING YEAH YOU CAN
LIKE UM MAYBE A TA UH LIKE A TAPE MEASURER PROBABLY UM INCHES OR
IN THE METRIC SYSTEM I'D PROBABLY USE
UM CENTIMETERS YEAH
YEAH AND I YEAH I THINK UH WATER BOILS HERE AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES TWO TWELVE YEAH
ICE AND WATER UM
MMM OH YEAH YEAH UH-HUH YEAH YEAH WE HAD A CUP OF ICE WATER AND A CUP OF HOT WATER
YEAH IT WENT WAY WAY DOWN IT WENT IT WAS LIKE AT EIGHT
AND TURNS OUT THESE WERE EXACT SAME A AND C WERE THE EXACT SAME TEMPERATURE YEAH
THEY WERE EXACTLY THE SAME
OF MEASUREMENT YEAH
MMM YEAH W YEAH YEAH BECAUSE THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS AND
AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZED PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THAT IS NOT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT NOT A STANDARD MEASUREMENT
KILOLITER IS ONE THOUSAND NO YEAH ONE THOUSAND LITERS
UH IT MEANS SOMETHING THAT'S EQUAL THAT WE CAN USE TO MEASURE STUFF
A KILOLITER WITH UM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS I'VE NEVER LEARNED THAT
YEAH KINDA BUT IT WAS SMALLER I'D SAY
WELL UM LET'S SAY
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT
GRADUATED CYLINDER YEAH
UM I'LL SA IT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT FULL YEAH
IT MEANS THAT THIS IS BIGGER THAN THIS THIS WHOLE THING IS BIGGER THAN THIS WHOLE THING MUCH BIGGER
NO I DON'T THINK NO WE DIDN'T
WELL WE HAVE DONE ESTIMATING
I KNOW THAT UH LITERS IS
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE THESE MEASUREMENTS ON THE SIDE IT JUST HAS A B C AND D
NO IT'S NOT STANDARD AT ALL
IT MEANS THAT TEN OF THESE EQUALS ONE LITER
YEAH
OKAY OKAY
YOU USE EM TO M MEASURE THE MASS
WELL I WASN'T HERE WHEN THEY WERE STARTING I WAS SICK AND THAT WAS THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DAY
YES WE'VE WEIGHED QUITE A LOT WE'VE WEIGHED UM SOME PEOPLE BROUGHT IN WE'VE WEIGHED ERASERS WE'VE WEIGHED A BUNCH OF STUFF
YUP DOES
NO IT WAS UM OUR TEACHER'S YEAH
I BET SHE DID
YEAH A LOT OF MY WERE ACCURATE I GOT I ALWAYS I WAS EITHER IN THE RANGE FROM TEN OFF OR ZERO OFF
YEAH WE USED A SPONGE THIS MORNING
YEP A WE WEIGHED A SPA DRY SPONGE PRETTY LIGHT AND THEN WE WEIGHED THE SPONGE FULL OF WATER AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS FIFTY SEVEN GRAMS
THE WATER INSIDE THE SPONGE CAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH THE SPONGE COULD SUCK UP
UM HOW MUCH IT COULD SUCK UP AND HOW MUCH WATER WOULD WEIGH
YOU COULD WEIGH PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING BUT WITH A BALANCE IT'D BE HARD TO WEIGH LIKE A COMPUTER OR SOMETHING SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE
PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU USE AT THE DOCTOR'S
A SCALE YEAH YEAH
UM WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MEASUREMENT LATELY IT'S BEEN DOING GOOD
WELL WE HAD A BIG CONTAINER BUT THEN A LITTLE CONTAINER ABOUT THAT BIG AROUND
MMM HMM UM WE'D JUST SAY WE'D WRITE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER IN YEAH
TO THE TOP YEAH UH-HUH
UM YEAH I THINK SO SOME GOT FIVE AND A HALF
UM TOLD ME THAT'S LIKE NOT ALL THE CUP VIALS WERE THE SAME SIZE
YEAH WE WROTE OUR NUMBER DOWN YEAH PAPER
YEAH SO THAT'S WHY SOME BOYS GOT IN TROUBLE THEY COLORED THE WATER WITH MARKERS
YEAH NOT EVERYBODY'S VIALS WERE SAME SIZE MISS BALASCO SAID IN FRONT OF THE CLASS
SO WE COULD ALL GET THE SAME BECAUSE WE WERE PUTTING IT INTO A BIG MILK JUG AND SEEING HOW MUCH WE WOULD GET
N MMM NOT REALLY IT'S JUST LEARNING
UM YEAH WE MEASURED IT IN METERS TAPE
YOU DON'T GET THE EXACT MEASUREMENT
THAT FOUR VIALS EQUAL THAT
NO THE SIZE OF THE CUP
I AM NOT SURE I THINK SHE DOES THAT SO YOU CAN T SEE LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S GOING ON AND NOT
YEAH YOU'RE
WELL IF YOU THINK OF IT THESE THESE TWO EQUAL ONE OF THOSE
YEAH YEAH PUT IT IN THE SAME CUP AS THE OTHER ONE AND SEE IF IT'S BOTH THE SAME SIZE
BECAUSE WE WANT THEM ALL TO GET THE SAME SIZE
UM I CAN'T A MILLILITER
YEAH THERE IS I COUNT BY TENS ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED
WELL LIKE THIS MMM HMM
TEN MILLILITERS
UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS I THINK
YEAH NO IT WAS A NO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
THAT IS A LOT LIKE A THOUSAND
UM ADDED IT UP I'M TAKING AFTER MY MOM
YEAH WE WE D DON'T REALLY DO IT WITH ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IF IT'S ROCKS IT'S TOO HARD FOR UH DON TO PICK UP OUR JANITOR
YEAH BUT IT'D MAKE A BIG MESS
UM HOW BI HOW MUCH WATER YOU WANT OR SOMETHING LIKE HOW MUCH YOU WANT IN A DRINK MMM HMM
NO WE DIDN'T YEAH WE USED THOSE THINGS THAT SUCK IT UP AND THEN POP IT OUT AND EVERYTHING YEAH YEAH
MILLILITERS THAT'S HARD TO REMEMBER
YEP YEAH
MMM WHAT LIKE
YEAH WE ALSO MEASURED OTHER STUFF WITH THE METER TAPE
MMM HMM UH SMALLER
YEAH I CAN'T REMEMBER
UM I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU THAT UM SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T KNOW
UM LIKE SOMETIMES YOU WANNA PUT IS CEMENT A LIQUID IS CEMENT WET CEMENT A LIQUID
OKAY WELL THEN YOU COULD LIKE I HAVE NO F YEAH
AND SANK AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UM GOOD
WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE MATH QUITE YET BUT AFTER RECESS WE WILL AFTER ACTUALLY WE WILL BE
WELL YESTERDAY LET ME THINK A SECOND
DENOMINATORS DA S LITERS THAT'S HARD TO LEARN
YEAH SO YEAH
YEAH AND I ACCIDENTALLY PUT TOO MUCH SO I PULLED SOME OF IT OUT YEAH RIGHT LEVEL MMM HMM UH-HUH
NO WE WELL YEAH IT DOES BUT WE DON'T USUALLY USE THE NUMBERS
WE JUST TAKE SOME WATER AND WE'D FILL IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP AND WE'D JUST POUR SOME INTO A UNTIL IT'S AT THE TOP
NO WE HA WE PULL IT UP AND THEN WE PUSH IT DOWN TO GET IT OUT
UM WE HAVEN'T BEEN AT MATH TODAY AS THEY SAID SO YEAH
IT WAS ABOUT YEAH THAT SAME THING THAT I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT
WE HAD TO MAKE AN ESTIMATE THEN
B THE WATER UP TO B
I TH UM I JUST KINDA THINK OF LIKE WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK IN THE TUBE AND DO THAT TYPE OF STUFF
YEAH AND WE DIDN'T GET TO C BUT UM
FORTY FIVE PLUS TEN YEAH
WELL UM THE DISTANCE LET'S WAIT FOR THESE GUYS TO GO THROUGH
UM A HUNDRED AND TEN THAT WOULD PROBABLY GO UP TO D
FOR WAIT UM YEAH BASICALLY
THAT SLIPPED
NO NO
OH REALLY BIG PROBABLY THIS A BEAKER
LIKE A LITER THEN
UM HOW MANY
I HAVEN'T GOT TO THAT YET
UH-HUH YEAH
BUT WHO'S STUDENT NUMBER ONE
YEAH EXCEPT FOR THE OTHER REASON I'M NOT A ROBOT
UM YEAH BUT THERE'S THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER FOR COLD AND HOT AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THIS IS MINE C A B
I DON'T KNOW IT HAS DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES JUST LIKE A THERMOMETER
UM I DON'T KNOW SURE YEAH BUT YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO PUT IT IN FOR ONE SECOND
UM MORE
WELL ACTUALLY MY FINGER YEAH WELL NO MY THE THERMOMETER
UM SO LIKE YEAH THAT'S TWENTY THAT'S COLDEST AND THESE ARE THE SAME
SHOW IT TO THE CAMERA
YEAH JUST GO BACK DOWN TO ONE OF THESE NUMBERS HERE TWENTY
FOR ONE WE HAVE A VERY COLD THING
B UM OUR B WAS COLD
OKAY SO WELL WE HAVE A THIRTY DEGREE AND A EIGHT DEGREE WE MA WELL WHEN WE MIXED IT IT TURNED INTO LIKE UM THE
LIKE IT TURNED INTO THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE ROOM TEMPERATURE
NO WE USUALLY DO IT BUT THIS TIME WE DIDN'T
MY FINGER LIKE DOES NOT LIKE COLD WATER AND Y AND IT LIKES THE HOT WATER A LOT
YEAH LIKE METER TAPE AND YARDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SPONGEBOB
WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING FRACTIONS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MEASUREMENT
MEASURING IS KINDA DIFFICULT FOR ME BUT I THINK I'VE CAUGHT ON TO IT
UM I DON'T KNOW JUST TRYING TO GET THE PERFECT ANSWER BECAUSE MY RULER IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S RULER
YEAH OUR METER TAPES ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE SOME OF OUR UM THINGS ARE SPREAD APART FROM THE TAPE
UM NO I DON'T
OH YES THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WELL CENTIMETERS ARE ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF INCHES
WELL NOT EVERYBODY MEASURED THEM AGAINST THE WALL BUT I DID AND SO DID MY FRIEND ALEXIS AND MACKENZIE
YEAH WE STOOD UP AGAINST THE WALL AND WE MEASURED FROM THE GROUND TO THE TOP OF OUR HEADS WITH OUR SHOES OFF
I WAS ABOUT ONE FIFTY FIVE OR SOMETHING YEAH HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE CENTIMETERS
NO THEY DIDN'T BUT THEY TRIED AND THEY WEREN'T S WAY OFF
YEAH YEAH AND THEN WE GOT IN LINED ORDER JUST TO SEE HOW WE DID
LIKE SO SMALLEST TO TALLEST
UM YEAH I THINK IT WAS COOPER
MEREDITH YEAH SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THE TALLEST IN UNITS
SHORTEST TO TALLEST YEAH I WAS PRETTY TALL BUT
WELL THEN WE STARTED TO MEASURE THINGS LIKE OUR DESKS AND OTHER STUFF
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD YEAH I GOT IT AND THINGS UH-HUH
WELL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT YOUR FINGER IN THE PLACE IT ENDED AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEASURE IT AGAIN
WE MEASURED I MEASURED MISS BALASCO A LITTLE
NO SHE'S ABOUT WAIT YEAH SHE WAS ONE AND A HALF METERS SHE WAS SHE DIDN'T APPRECIATE ME DOING THAT THOUGH
A METER IS LIKE ABOUT IS IT I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED INCHES A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
YEAH I MEASURED LIKE LIGHTS THE LIGHT FIXTURE AND PEOPLE AND UM LIKE TABLES AND STUFF
YEAH UH-HUH YUP
NO A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE
YEAH YEAH
AND ANOTHER HALF OF A METER YEAH
UM THE FIFTY MILLILITERS LINE WE HAD TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS FIFTY MILLILITERS BE
THAT'LL BE COOL
NO BECAUSE SOME OF US STARTED IN DIFFERENT SPOTS
UM WE USED STRAWS TO MEASURE AND OUR MATH TEACHER GAVE US DIFFERENT SIZE STRAWS SO WE ENDED UP WITH DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS
GROUP B HAS A SMALLER SIZED STRAW THAN GROUP A
THE MEASUREMENTS OF MILLIMETERS CENTIMETERS DECIMETERS AND METERS
SMALLEST IS THE CENTIME IS THE MILLIMETERS
I BELIEVE THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER
YOU'RE CORRECT BECAUSE STRAWS CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZES
WITH A TAPE MEASURER OR UM A RULER
YES BECAUSE STANDARDS MAKE IT MAKES IT EASIER TO GET AROUND THE SAME TYPE OF MEASUREMENT
UH NO NOT REALLY
I THINK SHE NEEDS TO TALK A BIT MORE CLEARLY
WELL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT GRAMS AND ABOUT THE METRIC SYSTEM
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WELL WHEN YOU WEIGH WITH GRAMS IT'S BASICALLY LIKE YOU TRY TO
WELL WHEN WE WEIGHED THE WOOD CHIP IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF HEAVIER THAN THE POKER CHIP THINGY
WELL IF THEY AREN'T THE SAME SIZE THEN IF SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET THE SAME ANSWER AS YOU THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME ANSWER
WELL IF IT'S LIKE GOING TO SOME PLACE AND PUT IT IN YOU PROBABLY WANT TO TRY TO GET THE SAME ANSWER
WELL THE METAL IS HEAVIER THAN THE POKER CHIP THING AND
WELL BECAUSE THE METAL IS LIKE MORE DOWN THAN THE POKER CHIP
WELL I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT ANY OTHER WAY
WELL IT MEANS LIKE ONE SIDE IS UNEVEN THAN THE OTHER
IT MEANS LIKE ONE SIDE IS DOWN AND ONE SIDE IS BASICALLY UP
I THINK I WOULD MOSTLY USE A SCALE
IT MEANS LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GET IT EVEN WITH THE ORANGE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE METRIC SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN USING A LOT OF WATER
WELL UM TODAY W
E USED LIKE TODAY
I KIND OF FORGOT THE NAME OF IT
WELL IT'S BASICALLY LIKE UM THE VOLUME OF THINGS AND
CAN SEE LIKE IF IT'S NINETY FIVE
WELL IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT SOMETHING IS YOU USE THE SYRINGE THING AND THEN YOU FILL
UP AND S SEE HOW MUCH THERE IS AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE UM THE WATER'S UP TO A HUNDRED MILLIMETERS
UM THEY'RE LIKE
WELL UM WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS THESE ARE MILLILITERS AND THE
UM IT TAKES A HUNDRED OF THOSE TO FILL UP THE
WELL IT TAKES TEN OF THESE TO GET IN T FOR ONE LITER
WELL IT'S BASICALLY LIKE HOW MUCH WATER IS IN A CUP AND YEAH OR SOMETHING
WELL I SEE THAT UM ON THE SECOND PICTURE THE WATER IS UP TO THE B AND ON THE FIRST PICTURE THE WATER IS UP TO THE D
WELL BASICALLY YOU USE A AN
ESTIMATING THE MEASURING CUPS
YOU KIND OF TRY TO GUESS WHAT YOU THINK THE ANSWER WILL BE
I THINK THEY'RE MEASURING A HAND
EITHER A YARD STICK A RULER OR A METER TAPE
HE'S MEASURING A DOOR OR A DOOR KNOB
WE USED GRAMS AND MASS BLOCKS AND WE HAD FIVE TENS AND TWENTIES AND ONES
WE'RE TRYING TO LIKE UM ADD THEM TOGETHER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MOUSE AROUND
MMM WELL IT WASN'T THE BEST WAY BUT IT WAS A GOOD WAY
OK YOU DO I PRESS THE ARROW
SAME THING BUT IF THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHT OR SOMETHING
WELL ON THE THING THAT SAYS LIKE Z ZERO TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY AND THEN UM YEAH
THERE'S NUMBERS ON THE SIDES AND SO IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO FIFTY I THINK AND YEAH
THAT MEAN HOW MUCH YOU HAVE IN THE LIKE THE THE SYRINGE
WELL WE DIDN'T REALLY USE IT YESTERDAY SO
YOU WOULD SEE HOW MANY SQUIRTS IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL UP THE WHOLE CUP AND THEN WE WOULD FILL OUT THIS PAPER AND SO YEAH
WELL WELL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ACCURATE MEANS BUT I THINK THAT'S A YES
YOU COULD BUT IT'D TAKE A LONG TIME
A THOUSAND UM THINGS
UM A SYRINGE
MULTIPLICATION DIVISION AND UM MEASUREMENT
WELL WE'RE RIGHT NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY LEARNING ABOUT THE METRIC SYSTEM
WELL CENTIMETERS CAN BE IMPORTANT FOR MEASURING A LOT OF THINGS
WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING LIKE A FOOTBALL MAYBE A SMALL ANIMAL OR SOME LIKE A BALL
IS UM THEY'RE BOTH A TYPE OF METER
OUR BODIES TABLE COUCH AND MY DESK
OKAY THANKS AND I LIKE THE COLORS
USING THE TAPE MEASURE TO MEASURE HIMSELF THE STRAIGHTER ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE WITH THE BENDED ONE HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE OFF CAUSE IT'S BENDED
YES THE STRAIGHT ONE DOESN'T REACH THE GROUND BUT THE STRAIGHT ONE REACHES BOTH THE GROUND AND THE HEAD
HE IS MEASURING HIS ARM SPAN WHICH IS THE SAME AS YEAH HE'S MEASURING HIS ARM SPAN
WELL IF HE USED THE THING THAT HE'S USING TO MEASURE HIS ARM SPAN HIS BODY WILL PROBABLY BE THE SAME LENGTH
MAYBE A MEASURING TAPE OR UM OR METER OR METER STICK
WELL IT HAS LIKE THREE ME IT IT'S IT HAS ONE METER ON IT AND YOU CAN MEASURE ANYTHING WITH IT
WELL WHEN WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO MEASURE THE THEY GO INTO KILOMETERS I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT THOUGH
WELL FOR LIKE PLANETS THEY WOULD USE KILOMETERS BUT THINGS ON EARTH THEY WOULD USE METERS
THE THEY CO WOULD USE A LOT OF KILOMETERS
SHOULD I CLICK ON ROBI TO BEGIN
THANK YOU THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME
WE KNOW THAT ACTUALLY YOUR ARMS CAN BE A LITTLE SHORTER THAN YOUR BODY LENGTH
NO BECAUSE THEY DON'T COUNT THE FINGERTIP
TO WHERE IT'S THE HEIGHT OF ONLY ONE OF HIS FINGERS
FINGERS ARE ONLY IN CENTIMETERS
IT'S JUST SO MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT MEASUREMENT AND MEASURING FINGERS IS A GOOD WAY TO LEARN ABOUT SMALL MEASUREMENTS
PT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU CAN MAKE A MANY MEASUREMENT BOOK
NO NOT YET BUT I THINK WE WILL
YES BECAUSE A THERE'S NOT A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE PINKIES SO IT WOULD BE ACCURATE TO MEASURE PINKY BY PINKY BY PINKY BY PINKY
HELLO MARTY ARE YOU STILL THERE
OH WHY DID SHE DISCONNECT
WELL I READ IN THIS MEASUREMENT BOOK AND UM WE DIDN'T HAVE MATH ON THURSDAY SO ON FRIDAY
I MEAN YEAH THURSDAY AND SO ON
ON WEDNESDAY WE UM PLAYED WITH WATER AND AS A TOOL AND IT WA
SURE WATER WITH THEM THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEASURING CUPS YOU MEASURE STUFF WITH THEM
WELL THE GRADUATED CYLINDER HAD MARKS LIKE
WELL I BELIEVE THEY'RE UM THEY'RE A WAY OF MEASURING THINGS
CAN MEASURE WATER AND SMALL THINGS
BIGGER THINGS GO INTO KILOMETERS
AND I THINK IT'S CALLED A GRADUATED CYLINDER
WELL THEY CAN MEASURE WATER AND THEY HELP MEASURE OTHER THINGS TOO
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO TO KILOMETERS CAUSE
I WISH YOU COULD WAY BIGGER THINGS
UM A THOUSAND
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE METRIC UNIT
A HAND THAT IS BEING MEASURED
TEN CENTIMETERS
THEY MARKED WHERE THE CENTIMETERS ARE
A DOOR KNOB A DOOR IS BEING MEASURED WITH A METER STICK
WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING HOW TALL WE ARE AND WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING HOW LONG OUR ARMS ARE
I WAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE CENTIMETERS TALL ER
HE IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS TALL
ONE IS STRAIGHT ONE IS SQUIGGLY
IT IS BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW TALL YOU REALLY ARE WITH THE SQUIGGLY ONE YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL
A BOY IS MEASURING HIS WING SPAN
THEY'RE US THEY'RE THE SAME
I THINK IT IS EASIER THAN MEASURING WITH FEET
BECAUSE THEY ARE FORMED IN GROUPS OF TEN
CAPACITY IS THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID OR SOLID A CONTAINER CAN HOLD WITHOUT OVER SPILLING
YES WE HAVE DONE ESTIMATES IN OUR CLASS
I OBSERVED THAT THESE ARE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND WIDTH
S MILLILITERS ARE A STANDARD VOLUME
S ALL MILLILITERS ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE STANDARD UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
WE USE DEGREES CELSIUS DEGREES CELSIUS WERE WAIT
S THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICE AND TEMPERATURE
IN SCHOOL I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT AND UM THERE'S WE'VE BEEN LEARNING VOCABULARY AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS
UM THE PAPER CLIP COLLECTS THE NAILS UH
METALS COME IN DIFFERENT VARIETIES AND IT ER
I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT BECAUSE ONLY SOME HAVE MAGNETISM AND YEAH
THE UM MAGNET UM IT IT STARTED TO UM
UM THE IT HELPS WAIT
UM THE
UM WHAT'S IMPORTANT I
WELL THE WATER DROPLET OR DOME IS SLIDING DOWN A UM SLANTED SURFACE
WELL THE BIGGER THE DROPS WERE THE FASTER THEY MOVED AND THE SMALLER THEY WERE THEY BARELY MOVED AT ALL
WELL ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER ONE OF 'EM IS IN BETWEEN AND ONE OF THEM IS A LOT SMALLER
WELL THE BIG DROPS THE BIG A BIG DROP WILL FLOW FASTER BECAUSE IT'S HEAVIER AND A UH YEAH
YEP
UM I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS
UH YES WE DID
YES PRETTY MUCH BUT UM ONE TIME WE CHANGED 'EM BOTH
WELL YOU CAN SEE WATER DROPS MOVING IN RIVERS WATERFALLS LOT OF PLACES
WELL I SEE THEM WHEN IT RAINS WHEN IT UM YEAH JUST WHEN IT RAINS AND STUFF
YEP IT'S REALLY FUN
NO NOT UNLESS NO WATER DOES NEVER FLOW UPHILL
ONLY IF YOU HAD LIKE A VERY POWERFUL JET OR A VERY POWERFUL FAN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I LIKE UM STUDYING ALL EXPERIMENTS THEY'RE REALLY FUN AND THEY ACTUALLY DO TEACH YOU A LOT IT'S REALLY COOL
NO NOTHING WELL NOTHING OTHER THAN THE SURFACE TENSION THING NO
WELL ON THE ALUMINUM FOIL THE UH WATER DROPLETS ARE STARTING TO FORM A DOME
THANK YOU BYE MARNIE
WELL YOU CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR THE WATER PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A THERMOMETER
WELL THE GREEN LIQUID WILL GO UP ABOUT HALF OF THE TUBE
WELL THE WAY YOU MAKE THIS A THERMOMETER IS YOU CAN TELL BY HOW HIGH THE WATER LEVEL IS IN THE TUBE
WELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IN THE WATER ON THE CUP ON THE LEFT IS OBVIOUSLY COLDER BECAUSE IT'S BELOW ROOM TEMPERATURE
WELL IF YOU INCREASE ITS TEMPERATURE THEN IT'LL UH IT'LL GET A LOT BIGGER AND YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE AIR IS WARMER
WELL IF YOU INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE TOO MUCH THE WATER WILL WILL BE REALLY HOT AND IF YOU UM YEAH
THE WATER UM GETS A LOT BIGGER AND IT UH STARTS STEAMING
THE HOT WATER ALWAYS RISES ABOVE COLD WATER BECAUSE LIKE HOT AIR ALWAYS GOES ABOVE COLD AIR
WHEN YOU UM RAISE THE TEMPERATURE THE WATER LEVEL GET HIGHER WILL GET A LOT HIGHER AS YOU RAISE THE TEMPERATURE
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WELL THE WATER LEVEL GOES DOWN WHEN YOU DECREASE THE TEMPERATURE
I THINK THE WATER'S PRETTY COLD BECAUSE THERE'S ICE CUBES IN THERE BUT UM YEAH AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BELOW ROOM TEMPERATURE
WELL THE UM WATER GOES DOWN OR UP DEPENDING ON WHAT TEMPERATURE
WELL THE UM WATER LEVEL WILL GO BACK DOWN PRETTY FAR
BYE MARNIE THANK YOU
THE CORK IS UM LESS DENSE THAN WATER AND THAT'S THAT'S LIKE WHY IT FLOATS
BYE MARNIE THANK YOU
WELL WHEN YOU UH COOL WATER IT FREEZES
WELL CONTRACTS MEANS LIKE GETS SMALLER IT'S LIKE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF EXPAND AND IT GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER
THE COLD WATER IS KIND OF LIKE BULGING OVER AND THE HOT WATER IS JUST SITTING THERE
WELL THE UM WATER GETS A LOT COLDER AND IT IT GETS A LOT COLDER
WHEN YOU FREE WHEN YOU FREEZE WATER IT UM IT HARDENS AND TURN INTO A SOLID IT'S CALLED ICE
WELL THAT TELLS ME THAT THE WATER THE ICE WELL THE WATER EXPANDS WHEN YOU FREEZE IT BECAUSE IT'S GETTING BIGGER AND PUSHES OUT THE OPENING
WELL COOL WATER CONTRACTS AND GETS SMALLER THAT'S WHY THE WATER LEVEL IS GOING DOWN
THE WATER MOVING ON THE TUBE TELLS ME THAT THE WATER'S CONTRACTING AND GETTING SMALLER
WELL UM SLOWLY OVER TIME THE WATER IS LIKE IS EVAPORATING AND IS DRY AND IT'S DRYING UP
WELL YOU CAN TELL WELL THERE'S WATER ON THE TABLE WAIT WHAT I DIDN'T GET THAT
YEAH I COULD
HI MARNIE IT'S GOOD
AFTER IT DRIES OUT THE WATER'S INVISIBLE CAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S ALREADY EVAPORATED AND IT'S SPREAD OUT
WELL UM
OKAY GOOD BYE MARNIE THANK YOU
WELL WE PUT UM DIFFERENT CUPS IN LIKE IN DIFFERENT UH
THEY WERE A LOT DIFFERENT
WELL UM WHEN IT WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES IT IT JUST
OKAY BYE MARNIE THANK YOU
WELL UM THE ONLY THING THEY REALLY HAD IN COMMON WAS THEIR VOLUME
EVAPORATION WOULD PROBABLY TAKE PLACE IN THE UM FLATTER ROUNDER ONE THAN GRADUATED CYLINDER
HI MARNIE I'M BACK
OKAY MARNIE I'M STILL THE SAME STUDENT
WELL UH SURFACE AREA IS LIKE THE UM
BYE MARNIE
WELL UM SURFACE AREA IS LIKE THE AREA OF THE UH UM CONTAINER THAT TOUCHES THE AIR PRETTY MUCH
MARNIE UM WE'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS SO I GOTTA GO
UM I WE ONLY USED LIKE ONE SOIL AND JUST ONE GRAVEL BUT YEAH
BYE MARNIE THANK YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER AND YEAH
UM TODAY WE UH PUT LIKE LITTLE WATER DROPLETS ON PENNIES AND WATCHED HOW THE SURFACE TENSION HELD TOGETHER
UM THE REGULAR WATER HAD THE BEST SURFACE TENSION AND YOU COULD PUT THE MOST DROPS ON THE PENNY
I DON'T REALLY GET THAT QUESTION
THE WATER DOESN'T ABSORB INTO THE ALUMINUM FOIL SO IT MAKES IT TURNS INTO LIKE BEADS
UM THE WATER IM IMMEDIATELY SOAKED INTO THE WELL ABSORBED INTO THE PAPER TOWEL
UM THE WATER IS BEING ABSORBED INTO THE PAPER TOWEL
WHEN THE WATER DROPS GET BY TO EACH OTHER THEY WOULD UM LIKE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THEN THEY WOULD TURN INTO ONE BIG WATER DROP
THE SMALLER WATER DROPS ARE UM COMBINING AND THEY'RE FORMING A BIGGER A BIGGER WATER DROP
YEAH AND YEAH WE DID
WELL THE WAY WE MOVE THE WATER IS WE PICKED UP THE WAX PAPER OR THE ALUMINUM FOIL AND MOVED IT AROUND
UM WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND SURFACE TENSION AND WATER AND SURFACE TENSION
UM SURFACE TENSION IS CLUMPING TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WATER INTO A DOME
WELL THE WATER'S CLUMPING TOGETHER TO FORM A BALL AND THAT CREATES SURFACE TENSIONS WHICH TURNS THE WATER INTO A DOME
THE SALT WATER'S FLOWING MORE THAN THE SOAPY WATER
YEAH I GUESS SO IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING
YES VERY INTERESTING
THANK YOU MARNIE OKAY I HAVE TO GO BYE
TODAY WE DID AN EXPERIMENT WITH WATER ON SLOPES
WATER MOVES ON ANY KIND OF SLANTED SURFACE
THE STEEPER THAT A SLOPE IS THE FASTER THE WATER WILL MOVE
THE DROPLETS ARE THREE DIFFERENT SIZES
A BIGGER DROP WILL GO DOWN S A SLOPE FASTER THAN A SMALLER DROP
THE BLUE SURFACE IS SLANTED WHICH IS MAKING THE WATER GO DOWN
I REALLY DON'T KNOW MY TEACHER JUST GAVE US WAX PAPER TO DO IT ON
NO BECAUSE THE WATER WOULD SOAK INTO THE PAPER TOWEL
BECAUSE OF GRAVITY ON A SLOPE WATER WILL GO DOWN INSTEAD OF UP
GOOD
THEY ARE LESS DENSE SO THEY ARE FLOATING
THE OBJECTS HA ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO THEY WILL FLOAT
THOSE OBJECTS ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER SO THEY WILL FLOAT
IF IT IF SOMETHING IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER IT ISN'T AS HEAVY
THE ROCK AND P THE PAPER CLIP WOULD SINK CAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN WATER
SINKING TELLS ME THAT THE DENSITY OF THE OBJECTS IS MORE THAN THE WATER
HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT WILL FLOAT TO THE TOP
THE HOT THE RED HOT WATER WENT STRAIGHT UP TO THE TOP
THE HOT WATER'S JUST STARTED TO FLOAT UP TO THE TOP
THE BLUE WATER JUST MOSTLY STAYS IN THE VIAL
COLD WATER'S MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE JUST LIKE OTHER OBJECTS THAT SINK
THE WATER LEAKS OUT OF IT AND IT EITHER STAYS THERE FOR A WHILE OR EVAPORATES
WATER IS EVAPORATING
THE WATER IS GETTING READY TO EVAPORATE
THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE AND GO UP TO THE SKY AND FORM CLOUD AND
UM THE WATER ON THE TABLE EVAPORATED
WATER VAPOR IS WHEN WATER TURNS INTO A GAS IT TURNS INTO WATER VAPOR
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SEE WATER IN THE AIR
UM THE EVAPORATION WILL BE QUICKER THAN WHEN IT IS COOLER
UM THE
THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH EVAPORATION AT LOW TEMPERATURES
WHEN THE AIR IS HUMID OR FULL OF MOISTURE IT MEANS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF EVAPORATION GOING ON
THERE IS LESS EVAPORATION IN THE JUNGLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS HOT AS THE DESERT
DESERT AIR HAS MORE HEAT SO IT EVAPORATES MORE
I THINK MORE WATER WILL EVAPORATE OVER TIME BECAUSE UM YOU WILL GIVE IT MORE TIME WITH THE AIR AND DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF HEAT
WATER IN THE AIR'S CALLED WATER VAPOR IT IS A GAS IT'S IT FORM
UM THE MATERIALS THAT EVAPORATE ARE WATER AND
BEFORE WATER EVAPORATES IT IS LIQUID
WATER GOES INTO THE AIR AND TURNS INTO A GAS CALLED WATER VAPOR WHEN IT EVAPORATES
THE OBJECT HAS TO BE COLD AND IT HAS TO HAVE UM WATER VAPOR AROUND IT
THE FORM THE WATER IS IN IS WATER A IT IS IN THE FORM OF LIQUID
HELP US SEE WHAT CONDENSATION IS LIKE AND WE COULD WATCH CONDENSATION HAPPEN
WATER IS CONDENSING
THE ROUNDISH OBJECTS ON THE TOP OF THE CONDENSATION
UM THERE IS
YOU CAN MAKE FLOWING WATER GO DOWNHILL
THIS PICTURE IS OF A MILL AND IT IS SHOWING A WATER WHEEL
THE SHAFT HOLDS UP THE PLATES
YOU CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY
YOU CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY USING A SPECIAL PLANT AND WATER I THINK
WATER KEEPS ALIVE I DON'T KNOW M
THAT WATER IS THE ONLY MATERIAL FOUND NATURALLY ON EARTH IN ALL THREE STATES
TODAY WE MADE A MOCK THERMOMETER OUT OF COLORED WATER
UM SOME TEMPERATURES CAN BE HOT SOME CAN BE COLD AND SOME CAN BE IN THE MIDDLE
YOU USE A THERMOMETER
IT MEANS TWO IF WATER'S EXPANDING IT WILL TAKE UP MORE ROOM
WHEN YOU INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF WATER IT WILL EXPAND
IT FEELS WARMER
UM THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS HOT
WHEN YOU DECREASE THE TEMPERATURE THE WATER IN A THERMOMETER WILL GO DOWN
THE TEMPERATURE IS
THE WATER WILL CONTRACT
WHEN YOU REMOVE THE HEAT THE WATER WILL CONTRACT AND TAKE UP LESS SPACE
UM YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW
UM JUST USE AN IMAGINARY METER TAPE
IT'S A BETTER WAY BEFORE YOU GIVE THE EXACT ANSWER
IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S A GOOD THING TO DO BEFORE YOU GET THE EXACT ANSWER SO YOU CAN JUST GET THE IDEA OF WHAT THE ANSWER IS
UM MAYBE YOU COULD JUST USE SOME AN ESTIMATION CHART I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE THOUGH
TEN INCHES
ABOUT FIVE INCHES
UM YOU MA YOU MIGHT NEED TO ESTIMATE WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING TO THE EXACT ANSWER
HE'S MEASURING THE WIDTH OF HIS PINKIE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE ONE CENTIMETER
UM THE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU NEED IS THAT RIGHT
YA KNOW I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A VIAL IS
UM WHAT'S A LITER BEAKER
IT'LL JUST HELP YOU MEASURE LIQUIDS
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS THE LENGTH AND WIDTH
A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN BY MILLILITERS
YOU BASICALLY USE A A RULER A MEASURING TAPE OR SOMETHING WHAT
FROM FRONT TO START BASICALLY YOU JUST START AT ONE END TO THE OTHER
AS LONG AS YOU GET THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION AND YOU END UP WITH A
ALL S UM ALL THE SI UM ALL PARTS YOU JUST WANNA KEEP THE MEASURING TAPE STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS GET THE SAME ANSWER AND YOU MAY HAVE MEASURED A LITTLE WRONG THE FIRST TIME
MEASURED THE PER YOU MEASURED THE PERS YOU MEASURE
HOW LONG YOUR FINGER AND HAND IS
BYE SORRY IF I DIDN'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU HAD BYE
GOO BYE MARTIE SORRY IF I DIDN'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU HAD GOODBYE I GOTTA GO
WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING THINGS AND SEEING HOW MUCH OF THAT THING THERE IS
WE MEASURED IT WE MEASURED VOLUME WITH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MEANING CAUSE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH ALL I KNOW SO FAR IN THIS UNIT
THEY'RE ABOUT BASICALLY MEASURING AND MEASURING
AND AND THAT IT AND MEASURING WATER AND ALSO MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN CAN THERE BE IN A CUP
E HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MEASUREMENT
ELL UM S WELL LIKE METAL IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC
TO ESTIMATE THE WEIGHT YOU COULD HOLD THEM AND SEE WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
UH THEY'RE PUTTING THEM IN THE CUPS ON THE SCALE
THE BLUE THING IS A SCALE
WELL THIS PICTURE IS OF A GRAM
CAN YOU CAN MEASURE UM PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WITH GRAM PIECES
IT'D BE HARD TO BUT YOU COULD
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT W WEIGHING AND SEEING HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH AND STUFF
I OBSERVED THAT THE METAL DISC WENT DOWN SO THAT MEANS IT WEIGHS MORE
I THINK THAT THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF AND STUFF
WE HOLD TH WE HOLD THE THINGS AND SAW WHICH ONE KIND OF WEIGHED HEAVIER TO US AND WE CHOSE THAT AS WHICH ONE MAY WEIGHED MORE
MARNIE YOU JUST ASKED ME THAT
YOU COULD UH UM
YES THEY CAN
FOUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGH AS MUCH AS A CHIP THAT MEANS
WE USE
UH TWO OF THAT IS BEING USED HERE IS A PLASTIC CHIP
WE USED SCALES AND OUR HAND
THESE OBJECTS ARE LITTLE PAPER CLIPS AND BIG PAPER CLIPS
IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BLOCK THAT IS ONE GRAM AND
THERE'S A ONE GRAM A FIVE GRAM A TEN GRAM AND A TWENTY GRAM WHICH IS WHAT WE LEARNED WITH RIGHT NOW
WE LEARN WE LEARNED ABOUT GRAMS
WITH GRAMS YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH GRAMS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH CAUSE THEY SAY ON IT PAPER CLIPS YOU HAVE NO IDEA
MARNIE I HAVE TO GO
MARNIE I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW
E MARNIE I HAVE TO GO
TO GO
A WASHER A WOOD CHIP AND A POKER CHIP
WELL METAL IS HEAVIER THAN WOOD AND WOOD IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC DUH
ONE IS METAL ONE IS PLASTIC AND ONE IS WOOD
YOU COULD FEEL HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
TO SEE IF THEY'RE SIMILAR TO THE OTHER ONE YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT OF
WE COULD PUT IT ON LIKE A MAIL WEIGHT WEIGHER AND SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
A METAL RING AND A WOOD CHIP WERE YOU LISTENING TO ME
MARNIE
CHOOSE THE CLASS ASSIGNMENT
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MARNIE
PAPER CLIPS GROUP ONE IS SMALLER THAN GROUP TWO I JUST NOTICED
CHANGE GROUP ONE INTO BIGGER PAPER CLIPS
I'M VERY GOOD THANK YOU
WELL COMPACITY IS WHERE YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIQUID
UM YOU I REALLY DON'T KNOW
I'M HAVE TO HAVE TO THINK ON THAT YOU CAN ASK ME IN A BIT
MARNIE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
YOU SHOULD ADD ANOTHER GRAM UNTIL IT'S EQUAL
THE BEST SIZED PIECES TO ADD WOULD BE TWENTY GRAMS OR TEN GRAMS
I OBSERVE THAT TEN TEN ONE HUNDRED GRAMS MAKES ONE KILOMETER
MARNIE I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COULD YOU PLEASE SAY THAT AGAIN
YES THERE IS
THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT THAT I HAVE MADE SOME GOOD OBSERVATIONS
IT'S AN IMPORT MARNIE I DIDN'T HEAR YOU VERY WELL
MARNIE I REALLY DON'T KNOW I CAN'T REMEMBER
BYE MARNIE I ENJOYED SPEAKING WITH YOU
I'M GOOD MARNIE
SORRY MARNIE I THOUGHT YOU SAID DAN BRIDGER
MARNIE I DIDN'T HEAR YOU CAN I'M I CAN'T HEAR YOU VERY WELL AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE AT THE MOMENT
UM MARNIE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE ME A MOMENT TO THINK ON THAT
MARNIE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE ME A MINUTE FOR TO UM TO THINK FOR OKAY
UM THAT UM WE ARE PUTTING OUR FINGERS IN WATER AND
MARNIE I HAVE TO GO BYE
IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME
WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH GRAMS
H SO YOU CAN USE THE NICKEL INSTEAD OF THE GRAMS SINCE YOU KNOW THAT THE NICKEL IS FIVE GRAMS
UH I THINK YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION AGAIN
I DON'T THINK WE REALLY NEED ANY NEW GRAMS PIECES BECAUSE IT THE TOY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME
YEAH YOU CAN
YEAH YOUR VOICE ISN'T COMING IN CLEARLY
THAT ONE KILOGRAM HAS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS IN IT
IT TAKE ONE THOUSAND N WA GRAM PIECES LITTLE GRAM PIECES TO MAKE A KILOGRAM
SO IT WAS STILL ONE MORE QUESTION
UM NINE GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
IT TAKES NINE HUNDRED GRAM PIECES TO EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
ACTUALLY I MADE A MISTAKE IT'S TEN
YOU USE KILOGRAMS IF YOU HAVE A FULL WATER BOTTLE AND A FULL LUNCH BOX AND
I'M NOT SO SURE
I THINK IT'S HEAVIER
SO SURE
I'M NOT SO SURE
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW HEAVY IT IS AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH IT'LL WEIGH THEN BY THINKING HOW HEAVY IT IS
AND YOU UM FEEL IF YOU'RE WEIGHING ANOTHER OBJECT WITH IT YOU FEEL WHICH ONE'S HEAVIER
UM THE THING IN ONE CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS
UM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY CAN BE USED FOR
YOU COULD USE TWENTY GRAMS TEN GRAMS OR FIVE GRAMS
I OBSERVED THAT THE TWENTY GRAMS ALL WENT IN AND IT MADE A HUNDRED GRAMS WITH SOMETHING ELSE
THE MASS OF THE GRAMS ON THE LEFT WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE GRAVEL ON THE RIGHT
I FOUND OUT THAT THE ORANGE WEIGHED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
A KILOGRAM IS MEANS A THOUSAND AND IT CAN
UH W ONE THOUSAND GRAMS ARE IN A KILOGRAM
WHEN YOU USE KILOGRAMS IT HELPS YOU WEIGH H HEAVIER THINGS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE SO MANY LITTLER GRAMS
I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WEIGHED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT EVERYONE WHO USES A BALANCE TO WEIGH GRAMS IS THAT IT MAKES IT MORE EQUAL
IF EV IF EVERYONE MEASURES WITH GRAMS YOU'LL PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER IF YOU WERE WEIGHING THE SAME THING
HOW YOU CALCULATE THE WEIGHT IS YOU ADD UP HOW MANY GRAMS AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER
WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURE TO FIND THE TEMPERATURE OF CERTAIN WATERS HOT OR COLD
TEMPERATURE IS ALL ABOUT
TEMPERATURE CAN MEATHER MEASURE WHAT IS HOTTER OR COLDER THAN SOMETHING ELSE
YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE A AN ESTIMATE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS HOW HOT OR COLD WITH SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF A THERMOMETER
I THINK NO BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STANDARD UNIT
HOW YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE IS YOU STICK IT IN AND WAIT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND THEN READ THE TEMPERATURE
YOU PLACE THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER
UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SWINGERS UM A PENDULUM
AND THE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STRING WITH THE PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY IT GOT FIVE
UM I GUESS WE JUST I I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
UM I FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT OR THE DIFFERENT LENGTH
SO LIKE THE UH WITH ONE PENNY THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD STILL GET FIVE
YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE HUNDRED THE NINETY FIVE THE ME
UM YES BUT UM OUR TEACHER HAD US COUNT ALL TOGETHER LIKE LIKE I HAVE SHOWN YOU THE WHOLE CYCLE
ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS
THE NUMBERS OF THE S YOUR YOUR SWINGS AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGTH
E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO
UM SORRY
SO IF THAT WAS THE LENGTH THEN
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
MMM THE TWO FIFTEEN WOULD MAKE ABOUT
THE SHORTER SWINGS UH SWING MORE TIMES THAN THE UM LONGER ONES
UM WE DID UM HOW BOATS FLOAT
WELL IT'S BASICALLY THE MASS AND HOW MUCH THE LIFEBOAT BOAT CAN HOLD
WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS
UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND
THE MILLILITERS WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN OUR CUP THREE CENTIMETERS
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER
FIVE INCHES
AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY
WELL I THINK THIS ONE CAN HOLD MORE WATER
FIFTY S A HUNDRED AND THREE AND FIFTY SIX
WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE
WELL I I WASN'T HERE FOR YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU SO IF THEY DID SCIENCE
THAT LIKE THE
I'M KIND OF STILL WONDERING WHY IT GOES TO THE SIDE AND WHY THE PENNIES JUST OBVIOUSLY WE PU WE TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN THEY LIKE GO TO THE SIDE
IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN
I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR LIKE I ALREADY KNEW THAT NO I'M KIDDING
YEAH YEAH MMM HMM I KNOW
THEN WE WIND IT UP AND WE TEST ALL OF OUR VARIABLES
UM LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP
WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP
CAUSE THAT WILL EVERYBODY WANTS A DIFFERENT ANSWER
SORRY UM I GUESS TO GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR EACH ONE
LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT
LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE
YEAH YEAH EVERYBODY DOES FOUR TRIALS ON EACH CENTIMETER
THE MASS DOES NOT UM CHANGE THE SWINGS OR THE START POSITION
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO TELL WHICH IS MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
WE TESTED THE MASS THE LENGTH AND THE START POSITION
AND THE MASS DID NOT CHANGE IT
THE VARIABLES WERE UM
WE WERE THE THERE WAS LENGTH THERE WAS UM
MASS AND THERE WAS START POSITION SO THOSE ARE THREE VARIABLES
WE EACH IN OUR CLASS DID A A DIFFERENT LENGTH
WE UM WE'LL GRAPH IT TODAY
WE HAVEN'T DONE THE GRAPHS YET SO
WE DID FORCE BUT WE DIDN'T TEST THAT YET
WE WERE THINKING THAT IF YOU FORCED IT TO GO IT WOULD DO MORE SWINGS
BECAUSE THEN IT YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED THE NUMBER OF SWINGS
YEAH OUR STANDARD WITH THE SIXTY METER
YOU WOULD GET ABOUT TWENTY TWO SWINGS
UM PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COUNT THE STANDARD
WE JUST SAID OKAY WHAT IF WE TESTED THIS AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN
YEAH WE DID IT HALFWAY BETWEEN UM STRAIGHT UP AND THE DESK WAY S
WE ACTUALLY TESTED THAT AND IT WAS THE SAME WE TESTED IT HALFWAY BETWEEN STRAIGHT DOWN AND DESK LEVEL S
NO NOT REALLY MMM HMM
TOO MUCH WATER TOO LITTLE WATER
UM A VARIABLE COULD BE UM
HOW MUCH FRESH AIR IT GETS
IT'S PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A STANDARD
A STANDARD WOULD BE LIKE AN OPEN CAN ON A WINDOWSILL THAT GETS A LOT OF SUN
BECAUSE YOU'RE E THE OTHER ONE IS IN THE SUN
YOU SHOULD PUT THEM BOTH IN THE SUN AND THEN WATER THIS ONE A LOT AND TH WATER THIS ONE NOT SO MUCH AND THEN KEEP THE STANDARD OVER HERE
UM WELL FIRST WE STUDIED THE PENDULUM
BECAUSE UM SOME OF USE WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT CUTTING SO WE CUT ALL TOO HIGH TOO LOW TOO
IT WASN'T A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE YEAH
WE ARE GONNA TEST THAT TODAY I THINK WE WERE THINKING ABOUT STABILITY
UM HOW MANY OR WAIT
THE SIZE OF THE BASIN THE SIZE OF THE CUP WHICH WE TESTED AND THEN UM
NO I NEVER THINK OF UNDERWATER I HATE IT
YOU'D HA WANT TO HAVE ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY
YEAH EXCEPT CHANGE ONE THING SO YOU'RE HA SO YOU'RE UM
WHAT I YOUR YEAH YOUR YOUR GUESS IS ALWAYS RIGHT
I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY
UM WHAT THE THE VOLUME HA WHAT THE VOLUME HAS TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS S
MY PREDICTION IS PROBABLY THAT THE LARGER THE LARGER VOLUME THE MORE PASSENGERS
WE NAMED IT LIKE SPEEDBOAT AND YEAH
THEY WE JUST NAMED IT TYPES OF BOATS LIKE S E THIS IS A SPEEDBOAT THIS IS A
UM NO I WAS JUST SURPRISED OF HOW MANY IT IT TOOK IT JUST LIKE
UM THE VOLUME WAS DIFFERENT AND SO WE DIDN'T MEASURE IT EXACTLY
UM PROBABLY MEASURING HOW MUCH VOLUME YEAH
NO IT I DUNKED IT UNDERWATER AND PUT IT ON AND THEN WHEN I THEN I'M NOT AND IT WENT
UM I THINK WE WERE CROSSING SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA
IT WAS LIKE AN HOUR MMM HMM YEAH
MMM HMM YOU WANNA CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND THEN KEEP THE REST STANDARD
IT WILL HELP US MAKE THE GRAPH THAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY
IT'LL HELP YOU UH SEE THAT WHAT THE OUR CONCLUSION IS
YEAH I'VE DONE A WHOLE ENTIRE UM UNIT ON GRAPHS IN MY SEVENTH GRADE MATH CLASS
UM THIS MMM THIS IS THE X THIS IS THE Y
SO WE HAVE UM BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
IT'S ATTACHED LIKE IT'S S HERE'S THE PLANE AND HERE'S THE STICK HERE'S THE PAPER HERE'S THE FAN IT PUSHES THE PAPER TO PUSHES THE PLANE
YEAH SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE PAPER LIKE RIGHT HERE
THAT'S NOT WITH THE PAPER ON IT IT'S THAT'S YEAH OR THE FAN
THAT TELLS US THAT IT'S IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE TEN WINDS TO START UP AND THEN IT PUSHES
MMM HMM S SO IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TEN PLUS TWENTY SIX PLUS FIFTY TWO TO GET ALL THE WAY ACROSS
WELL IF IT HAD WINGS OR NOT IF YOU UM THE IF YOU SHOOK THE STRING
I FORGOT YEAH
THAT MEANS IT WILL REALLY CHANGE AND YOU WON'T HAVE A CONCLUSION
YOU THIS ONE WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT MORE THAN FOUR METERS SO YOU DON'T TEST HOW MANY WINDS IT'S HOW FAR IT GOES
MMM HMM YOU'LL MEASURE THE DISTANCE IT FLEW
S SO YOU WOULD FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG THEN YOU WOULD TEST IT AND THEN IF UM
HOW DO YOU TE TEST IT WELL YOU COULD HAVE IT LIKE
YEAH YOU GO UP BY CERTAIN INCREMENTS
THE PROPELLER TO PULL IT OR YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING ON THE WINGS PUSHING IT
MMM HMM UH-HUH YEAH
UM YEAH
THE MINIMUM TO MAKE A MOVE WE HAVEN'T TESTED THAT WE'RE JUST MEASURING OKAY HOW MUCH DOES IT HAVE TO GO
FORCE IS UM AIR PUSHING THE PLANE
WELL WE DIDN'T DO SCIENCE TODAY YET
AND THEN WE SPUN IT ONE HALF A WIND LESS AND IT WAS HALF WE HALF A CENTIMETER AWAY
UH NO I REALLY DON'T I KNOW HE USED TO WORK AT BOEING
WELL I HAVE TWO DOGS UM MMM MMM
I I LIKE IT I UM AM VERY ADVANCED IN IT
BECAUSE I LIKE SCIENCE ALSO
WE DIDN'T REALLY GRAPH IT
UM WE HAVE A THING THAT FLIPS THE ALUMINUM BALL
WE PUSH IT DOWN AS FAR AS WE CAN
OF ALUMINUM FOIL
UH-HUH AND THEN SOME PEOPLE ARE TESTING THE MASS OF IT AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE IT TWENTY BY THIRTY TWENTY BY FORTY TWENTY BY FIFTY
MASS IS UM WEIGHT TO THE THING SO IT'S LIKE WEIGHT
WE'RE TRYING TO FLING IT AS FAR AS WE CAN
YEAH FOR S MOST OF US ARE TRYING TO DO IT FOR HEIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE GROUP THAT'S UM MY GROUP THAT'S MEASURING FOR DISTANCE
YOU TO GET THE MOST DISTANCE YOU HAVE TO GET THE ANGLE BRACE AT FORTY AND THEN EVERYTHING THE SAME
MMM HMM SO SO THEN THEN YOU PUSH THE STICK IN ALL THE WAY TIL SIX
THAT SIX IS THE MEASUREMENT UH ON THE UM STICK YEAH
THEN YOU PUT A SMALL BALL OF ALUMINUM FOIL YOU PRESS DOWN AND IT FLINGS AS FAR AS IT CAN GO
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT UM ONE GROUP IS TESTING AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TH GET PREDICTING THAT THE MASS WON'T AFFECT
WELL THE WELL UM MAYBE THE SHAPE OF THE BALL
IF IT WERE LIKE A CONE SHAPE MAYBE IT WOULD PIERCE THE AIR BETTER AND GO MORE
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ON THE S ANGLE BRACE THERE'S TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY
THEY WANT US TO GO UP BY A THAT BY THE SAME INCREMENTS
BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW THAT THIS AFFECTS THIS BY THIS MUCH SO WE CAN GUESS THIS WILL AFFECT THIS BY THIS MUCH
WELL WE ADDED UP THE FOUR RESULTS AND WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE EXACT AVERAGE
THE UM RESULTS OF THE UM FLIPPER HOW FAR IT WENT
WELL I LIKED THE RESULTS THAT IT MADE BEST
I LIKE UM SCIENCE SPACE MATH
WHAT MY DAD HAS TOLD ME ABOUT PHYSICS ALGEBRA
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE A BIGGER ANGLE BRACE AND GO UP BY FIVES
SO I'D GO UP TO LIKE SEVENTY INSTEAD OF JUST FORTY
BECAUSE I WANNA SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE LIKE POINT FIVE POINT
GEEZ EVERY TIME I PUT THIS THING OFF MY EARS
YEAH
WELL WE WROTE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN WE GRAPHED OUR FINDINGS
MAYBE FIFTIES BUT WHO CARES
YEAH AND AND
YEAH THAT'S WHAT YEAH Y GOES ON THE Y
YEAH AND I THINK WAIT THIS ONE WASN'T THERE IT WAS RIGHT THERE
AND THEN THE ZERO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO START AT THE ZERO SO THIS IS THE REAL GRAPH
LINE BETWEEN THE POINTS THIS IS ABOUT PRETTY GOOD LINE
I THINK THAT UM YOU KNOW NO GRAPH IS PERFECT AND SO IT JUST KINDA WAS THERE
WELL IF WE DID IT BETTER IF WE HAD LIKE A MACHINE DOING IT AND A MACHINE HEATING SYSTEM SEE LIKE ONE DEGREE CAN CHANGE IT
YEAH MMM HMM
THE BOTTOM ONE UM EACH TE EACH THING THAT IT COULD BE HERE
THE STANDARD NOTHING ON HERE IS THE STANDARD BUT IF YOU HAVE A STANDARD EVERYTHING HAS TO BE THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE VARIABLE YOU ARE CHANGING
I DON'T THINK WE GET TO DO IT BUT
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I WANNA DO SO ALL OF THEM ARE PRETTY HARD TO THINK ABOUT THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE JUST FLOODING ME
SO UM ONE IS
YES MMM HMM
YES THEY GOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T BOTH USING OFF OF THE SAME WIRE SO IT GOT BRIGHTER
A D CELL AND UM IT'S A ENERGY SOURCE YES MMM HMM
THE RECEIVERS YES
YES YEAH MMM HMM
SEPARATE UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES DON'T TOUCH
THOSE ARE THE WIRES AND THOSE ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
AND THEN IT'LL GO AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN THEN
I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT AND THEN LIKE THAT
IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT WAS JUST THE SAME THING ONLY THEY WERE ALL THE SAME LIGHT L YES YES
PATHWAYS THERE'S UH THREE
DEPENDING ON UM HOW MANY LIGHT BULBS AND WIRES YOU USE LIGHT BULBS PRETTY MUCH CAUSE IF THERE'S FOUR THEN THERE WOULD BE FOUR CIRCUITS
UH NOT REALLY
THAT ONLY WITH TWO OF THEM THAT WERE BRIGHT SO JUST LIKE THIS ONLY BRIGHTER
WE QU DIDN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT YET WE WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING SO TWO LIGHT BULBS
YES ONLY THESE WOULD PUT OFF MORE ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE MISS DUNN TOLD US THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE THIS
WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES EACH BATTERY WILL BE A SOURCE FOR THE LIGHT BULB FOR EACH LIGHT BULB AND IT'LL BE BRIGHTER
BECAUSE IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE JUST LIKE THESE ARE ENERGY SOURCES
UH THEN IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH BRIGHTER TWO YEAH LIKE THESE TWO THERE'S TWO HERE
W WE DIDN'T QU WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE WERE TRYING MANY MANY THINGS AND THEY JUST WEREN'T RIGHT SO WE R RAN OUT OF TIME
MMM HMM NO
UH YOU NEED THE WIRES MMM HMM
OH YE WE TRIED THAT ONLY WITHOUT THAT
WELL WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST TOOK A BATTERY THERE AND THEN WE JUST DID THAT AND WE THOUGHT THAT THOSE WOULD MIX AND THEY DIDN'T SOME
YOU NEED TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER SO IT MAKES MORE ENERGY FOR THEM TO FLOW
NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED THAT THAT MEANS IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY OR IT WON'T FLOW THAT WAY SO YES
BECAUSE IT GOES IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT MMM HMM YES THEY ARE
GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES IN THROUGH HERE GOES OUT
I WOULD STOP HERE I'D GO THROUGH AND THEN I'D GO BACK AROUND
IT WOULD GO IN HERE AND IT WOULD MAKE THAT ONE LIGHT UP
HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENERGY SOURCE
YEAH PARALLEL
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IF THERE'S TWO THAT GIVES UP GIVES OFF A LOT MORE ENERGY SO
MMM HMM YES
WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT A CIRCUIT IS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN VARY FROM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO A REGULAR CIRCUIT
THERE IS NO CIRCLE OR CONNECTION THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
MMM HMM OKAY UH NO NOT AT ALL
YES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THIS ONE SO NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN
BECAUSE THE BATTERY WOULD STILL GIVE OFF ENERGY AND IT WON'T AFFECT THAT ONE
IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THE BATTERY'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE OFF ENERGY TO THIS ONE TO GIVE OFF TO THAT ONE IF THAT ONE'S BROKEN THERE'S NO ENERGY TO GIVE OFF TO THE OTHER RECEIVER
OKAY NO NOT AT ALL
NO YES WE HAVE MMM HMM
PUSH IT IN LIKE ON AND OFF SWITCH
THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH THIS METAL BAR AND INTO THE OTHER UM METAL PIECE AND GOING THOUGH BACK TO THE WIRES AND INTO THE ENERGY SOURCE
MMM NOPE WE DID CONDUCTORS CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT UM ENERGY WILL GO THROUGH
YES A SPONGE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR
BYE I WANNA SEE NO I HAVEN'T
HELLO AWESOME
YES THERE IS HEY LOOK THERE'S BARS LIKE GOING UP YEAH IT DOES
HI YES WE HAVE
IT WORKED REALLY GOOD WE WERE ABLE TO PICK UP FIFTEEN SMALL LITTLE WASHERS WITH THE ELECTROMAGNET
UM WE PUT THEM ON THE ENDS OF THE BATTERY
THE OTHER TWO ENDS GO ON THE ENDS OF THE SWITCH
WELL IT WAS STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ENERGY IT CAN GIVE
NO WE JUST WHAT WE DID WAS WE JUST WRAPPED THE THINGS AROUND WITH NO ENDS
THERE WAS ENERGY AROUND IT BECAUSE THERE WERE FOUR ENDS SO THEY COULD GIVE MORE POWER
MMM HMM AND TWO ON THE SWITCH YES CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO S FOR ONE TO GO HERE AND AND THEN THERE'S THAT AND THEN THERE'S THAT SO WE STICK IT IN THERE
YES THAT'S ONE WIRE WE ONLY USED ONE
MMM HMM WE HAD TWO THERE AND TWO THERE AND THAT'S IT
IT WAS COMING FROM SO THEY'RE LIKE THAT RIGHT SO THE ONE'S COMING HERE AND ONE COMING HERE AND THEY COME TOGETHER
SO TWO ARE THIS WAY AND TWO ARE THIS WAY AND YEAH AND THEN WE JUST WRAP IT AROUND
THE EXTRA THE EXCESS YES THE ACCESS WIRE
NOTHING IT JUST WOULD ONLY PICK UP ONE PRETTY MUCH
IT PICKED UP WE GOT TWO SEVENTEEN WAS OUR HIGHEST I PICKED UP FIFTEEN AND MY FRIEND SIERRA PICKED UP SEVENTEEN
WELL BECAUSE IT'S A METAL WIRE GOING THROUGH THERE IT WON'T MAKE A CIRCUIT SO WHEN YOU OPEN IT WILL JUST STOP THERE
THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH THERE INTO THE THE NAIL AND THEN GOING JUST PICK UP THE WASHERS
NO NOT THEN IT WAS JUST A REGULAR OLD NAIL
YE UH NOT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IT WAS LIKE A MONTH AGO AT LEAST
WHAT I REMEMBER WITH TEMPORARY MAGNETS IS AS SOON AS YOU THEY DON'T STAY FOREVER SO
MMM HMM YES
WELL IT'S A REALLY ROUND BALL AND IT'S PROBABLY METAL
UM IT'S PRETTY BIG IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN THAT
TO THAT BALL YEAH AN ELECTROMAGNET
MAKING CARS I THINK MAYBE MAKING CARS UH-HUH OR CRUSHING CARS YEA L ELEVATORS
YES UM
YEAH I CAN AND
YES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PICK UP SO MANY JUST BY TIGHTENING IT AND MAKING IT MORE AND MORE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YEAH I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT THAT YES YEAH I WAS STILL A LITTLE SHOCKED ABOUT THAT THOUGH MMM HMM
YEAH
ANOTHER THING DID SURPRISE ME WHEN WE TOOK THE UM WHAT CAN I USE
IT'S STRIPPED
IT MEANS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PROTECTIVE SHIELD AROUND IT
INSULATOR
YES YES THAT'S WHY THEY ALL WIRES HAVE THAT AROUND THEM
YEAH MY DAD'S AN ELECTRICIAN SO HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THAT YES AND HE'S BEEN SHOCKED A LOT
YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TOUCH IT
WELL I'M NOT SURE BUT I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH TWO BATTERIES
IT'D BE EVEN EVEN STRONGER
OKAY AND SEE HOW MANY AND THEN THREE AND FOUR AND
YES AND THEN THE X
MMM HMM YES THANK YOU
NO YEAH
I SAW THE LITTLE THING GOING UP AND DOWN
MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
DID IT WE STUCK MAGNETS TO THINGS TO SEE WHAT WORKED
WE LEARNED WHATS WHAT WAS STEEL AND WHAT WAS IRON AND WHAT WASN'T
WE STUCK MAGNETS TO STUFF LIKE PAPER CLIPS
WE STUCK MAGNETS TO OUR DESKS AND S LIKE OTHER STEEL THING
THERE WAS THIS SCREEN AND A SPONGE AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT A
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY USE CERTAIN KINDS OF METAL TO PICK THINGS UP WITH MAGNETS
REALLY THIN METALS
IT'S NOT THAT BRIGHT WELL IT'S SORT OF BRIGHT
THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO MAKE IT BRIGHT
IT WORKS SORT OF LIKE THE OTHER ONE
IT'S KIND OF THE SAME
THE TOP ONE WOULD BE OUT TOO
THE BATTERY'S IN THE MIDDLE AND WIRES ARE GOING AROUND AND CONNECTING TO EACH TO TWO LIGHT BULBS
IF YOU MOUSE OVER THE SYMBOLS IT SHOWS YOU THE REAL THING
THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
IT'S FLOWING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO EACH LIGHT BULB
IT FLOWS TO THE POSITIVE END TO THE NEGATIVE END
IT'S LIKE THE SECOND PICTURE THAT WE LOOKED AT
LEARNING ABOUT THE CIRCUIT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY HOW THEY HOOKED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
WE USED WIRES TO HOOK THEM TOGETHER AND WE MADE THEM RIGHT
WITH ONE WIRE TO THE METAL PIECE WHERE YOU SCREW IT IN AND ONE TO THE THE BUMP ON THE BOTTOM
IF YOU MOVE THE MOUSE OVER THE LIGHT BULB IT SHOWS YOU THE INSIDE
THE LIGHT BULB THEN BACK TO THE BATTERY
THE ELECTRICITY'S JUST FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE
IT HAS TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM AND THE SIDE
IT HAS TO TOUCH THAT TO GET TO THE METAL THINGS AND IT HAS TO GET TO THE FILAMENT
IF IT TOUCHES THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM IT WON'T WORK
I'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WEIGHT IT TAKES IT ER YOU NEED TO BREAK THE FORCE
AND WE USED A UM MEASURE TO UM WE PUT ONE
WELL I IT BROKE BECAUSE UNDER THE WEIGHT UM IT KEPT GETTING UM HEAVIER AND HEAVIER
AT M MAYBE ON OUR BOARD
IS TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
PROBABLY PARALLEL
UM ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS STILL ARE LIT
WE HAVE BEEN LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH EITHER ONE OR TWO BATTERIES
I THINK I FOUND FIVE PATHS OF ELECTRICITY
ONE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH
I DON'T REALLY NOTICE ANYTHING
I DID NOT REALLY OBSERVE ANYTHING ELSE
IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY FROM THE MINUS SIDE
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO AND IT'S GOING GOOD
ONE WIRE FROM THE FROM EACH SIDE IS ON ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER WIRES ARE ON ANOTHER LIGHT BULB
IT HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUITS
IT REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT JUST LIKE THE ONES YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING ME
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
THEY ARE MAGNETS THAT YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF BUT ELECTROMAGNETS ARE
WHEN IT IS ACTING LIKE A MAGNET IT WELL
I WOULD USE AN OPEN A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
WE HAVE MADE A TEMPORARY MAGNET
THE THE POSITION OF THE SWITCH IS TURNING IS TO TURN THE ELECTROMAGNET ON AND OFF
BUT THE SWITCH IS TO TURN THE THE ELECTROMAGNET ON AND OFF
THE TYPE OF MATERIAL THE RIVET HAS TO BE MADE FROM I IS IRON YEAH IS IRON
ELECTROMAGNETS CAN PICK UP IRON OBJECTS
THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET WHICH IS MAKING IT ACT LIKE A MAG
IT IT THE RIVET HAVE A LOT OF WINDS WHICH MAKES IT PICK UP A LOT OF WASHERS
THERE IS A HUNDRED WINDS AND WELL
EVERY TIME YOU ADD MORE WINDS IT MAKES IT MAKES THE MAGNETISM
TO STRENGTHEN AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU MUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WINDS THAT YOU HAVE IN AT THE CORE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET
WELL PEOPLE LABLE GRAPHS IN IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAY
IT WAS ABOUT WELL WHEN YOU HAD TEN WRAPS IT WAS ABOUT
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO MARNIE BYE
YOU CAN CHANGE THE STRENGTH OF AN ELECTROMAGNET BY ADDING MORE WINDS
YOU CAN USE A GRAPH TO RECORD THE DATA THAT YOU GET
OKAY I WAS I WAS WAIT WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN
I'VE USED GRAPHS FOR MATH BUT I HAVE NEVER USED A GRAPH FOR SCIENCE BEFORE
I DON'T I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF ANY OTHER THINGS I WOULD USE A GRAPH FOR IN SCIENCE
DOING TEMPORARY MAGNETS
TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM
ABOUT LIKE PUTTING WEIGHT ON IT TO PULL THE MAGNETS APART
IT IS STARTING TO LOSE THE FORCE
AS YOU ADD MORE WASHERS THE MAGNETS START TO BREAK APART
IT MAKES IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF THE WASHERS
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE MAGNETS TO BREAK APART
GROUP C HAD A LOT LESS THAN GROUP A B AND D
THEY ALL HAVE NINETEEN WASHERS IN CUP B
THE RESULTS ARE PROBABLY BE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY PUT THEIR WASHERS IN CAREFULLY AND GROUP C DID NOT
WHEN YOU DO THINGS THE SAME WAY YOU'RE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE SAME ANSWER CAUSE IT'S CAUSE
WE HAVE BEEN FIGURING OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS
THE OTHER BULB IT'S STILL LIGHTING UP
ALL OF THE ELECTRICITY THE BALLS OR WHATEVER JUST FREEZE
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
MAKES IT BETTER BECAUSE IF ONE PATHWAY GOES OUT THE OTHER ONES ARE STILL GONNA BE ON
HELLO I'M LANDON I'M NINE YEARS OLD
YES I GOT IT TO WORK
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
IT IS A MAGNET AND IT PICKS UP THINGS THAT STICK TO IT
MAGNETS ONLY A ATTACH TO CERTAIN TYPES OF METAL
MAGNETS NORMALLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON
THE MAGNETS STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE
UM WE HAVE BEEN DOING ELECTROMAGNETS
I'M NOT SURE
I DON'T KNOW WELL I I HAVEN'T DONE ELECTROMAGNET YET
THEN THE WASHERS CANNOT GET PICKED UP
THAT THE THE CIRCUIT IS WORKING
THE ROLE OF A SWITCH IS TO BRING THE ELECTRICITY TO THE IRON CORE
IT HAS TO BE CLOSED TO MAKE THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACT TO THE WASHERS
THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE ALL THE WAY UP UP UP UP THROUGH ALL THE WIRES AND GOING DOWN BACK INTO THE
WELL TEMPORARY MAGNETS IT WELL IT MEANS TO ME THAT IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY GOOD MAGNET I GUESS
WELL IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE THE ELECTROMAGNET IS PICKING A LOT MORE WASHERS THAN THE REGULAR MAGNET
THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT
YOU HAVE ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION MARNIE
I I I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T LEARNED THIS LESSON
I I SAID IT ONCE AND I'LL SAID IT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T LEARNED THIS LESSON
I DON'T KNOW
MAGNETISM WORKS BY UM THE MAGNET HAVING FORCE
IT IS ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS CONNECTED TO THE NAIL SO IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
WELL ELECTROMAGNETS ARE TEMPORARY MAGNETS
IT SHOULD BE MADE OF IRON
WELL THE CIRCUIT IS COMPLETE AND IT IS IN CLOSED CIRCUIT AND YEAH
THE MORE YOU THE COILS THE MORE WASHERS YOU GET
OH IT'S A LINE GRAPH
THAT EACH WIRE WRAP YOU ADD THE HIGHER THE WASHERS GET
I OBSERVE AS THE NUMBER OF THE WRAPS GET LARGER THE NUMBER OF THE WASHERS GET LARGER
THE WASHERS KEEP INCREASING
WELL IT IT'S IT RELATES BECAUSE THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU GET THE MORE WASHERS YOU GET IT LIKE THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU GET UM THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE WASHERS YOU GET AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE GRAPH IS SHOWING
THAT THE STRENGTH IS INCREASING I MEAN YEAH INCREASING
THINK ROUND UM
THERE IS A MYSTERY BOX
THERE ARE MAGNETS INSIDE IT AND YOU AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY COULD BE
MAGNETS ARE HIDDEN INSIDE THE BOX
BECAUSE IF YOU BROUGHT THE COMPASS BY TO IT THE COMPASS WOULD WIG OUT AND GO CRAZY AND IF YOU BROUGHT THE BOX OVER THE IRON FILINGS THE IRON FILINGS WOULD GO CRAZY AND IF YOU AND IF AND IF YOU
UM WE WERE LEARNING HOW TO DO A BASIC CIRCUIT
THE PART OF A CIRCUIT WA CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE AND YEAH
THERE IS A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
IT IS CALLED A RECEIVER BECAUSE IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT
WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE MOTOR
I USED THE D CELL UM THE D CELL THE MOTOR THE WIRES AND THE SWITCH
I SEE A SCHEMATIC DRAWING OF A CIRCUIT
COMONENT IS A MOTOR
I ALSO SEE A BATTERY
IT MEANS IT'S THE SYMBOL OF THE MOTOR
IS A SWITCH THAT IS OPEN
IT IS A SWITCH
WE HAVE BEEN DOING INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS
ALL THE METALS ARE REALLY MAKING UM THE MOTOR GO
ELECTRICITY CANNOT FLOW OR MAKE A PATHWAY THROUGH THE INSULATOR TO GET TO THE OTHER WIRE
THE MOTOR DOES NOT GO ON BECAUSE THE INSULATOR IS BLOCKING THE ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH TO KEEP FLOWING TO THE OTHER WIRE
NOTHING HAPPENS ONCE AGAIN LIKE THE LIKE THE CRAFT STICK BECAUSE ELECTRICITY CANNOT GET THROUGH A SPONGE
BEEN DOING THE MYSTERY BOARDS
THE GREEN WIRE IS THE WIRE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE PAPER FASTENERS
THE WIRE UNDER IT IS ONLY CONNECTED TO THAT PAPER FASTENER
YOU OH IT'S THE CONTACT POINTS
BYE MARNIE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
WE HAVE BEEN DOING A
MAKE THE MOTOR GO OR LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB UP
IN THE FIRST ONE THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING REALLY BRIGHT IN THE SECOND ONE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE KINDA DIM
BLUE DOTS THAT ARE MOVING ARE THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
WELL THE BLUE BALLS ARE MOVING EXACTLY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY
ELECTRICITY'S FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING BACK IN THE POSITIVE SIDE
THAT EITHER WAY THE LIGHT BULB IS THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK IN THE POSITIVE
THEY'RE NOT DIM THEY'RE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER
WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL CIRCUITS
EITHER WAY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE THE PATHWAY IS THE SAME
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS UM IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS IN THIS PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THERE IS TWO PARALLEL NO NO NO THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS IN THE CIRCUIT
EACH SYMBOL REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT COMPONENT IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THIS SCHEMATIC DRAWING REPRESENTS UH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
ALL OF THESE SYMBOLS SHOW A COMPONENT IN A CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT OR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
UH WE HAVE LIKE A BALANCE BEAM
WE HAVE THESE GRAMS AND LITTLE GRAMS AND WE HAVE PAPER CLIPS PAPER CLIPS AND
AND WHAT ELSE A RED CIRCLE AND A WOOD CHIP AND A WASHER
TWENTY FI NA THERE'S FIVE TEN AND TWENTY AND ONES
MMM WE PUT WE HAD TO PUT IT LIKE IN THE MIDDLE TO BE BALANCED
YEAH MMM IF THAT WEIGHED MORE THAN THAT WE HAVE TO PUT MORE OF THESE IN
WHEN IT WAS MOVING WE C WE WE COULD JUST GO LIKE THAT AND PUT OUR EYES TO SEE IF IT'S BALANCED
UH YEAH
YEAH THOSE GRAMS YEAH
UH I FORGOT UH-HUH
UH DON'T FORGET UM YOUR UM OH I FORGET I DON'T
YEAH WE GET OUR WE GET OUR WHEN WE RIGHT
SOME ARE LESS AND SOME ARE BIG
BECAUSE THE BIG ONES WEIGH MORE THAN THESE
BECAUSE THESE WEIGH MORE THAN THAN THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE UM THE THE LITTLE ONES ARE REALLY LESS
YEAH THAT THING GOOD
BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN HELP US UM LESS OR MORE
YEAH YEAH
UH YEAH
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAID WHAT DOES THIS HAVE WHAT DOES THIS HAVE LESS AND THIS HAS MORE AND THE TEACHER SAID BECAUSE TO BE BALANCED
FIRST WE HAVE TO PUT A GRAM THEN PU UM PAPER CLIPS YEAH A STABLE
UH THEY THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY'RE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE TWENTY AND ONE THE TWENTY IS BIG AND THE ONE IS SMALL
THEY HAVE THE GROUP PLASTIC DISC WOOD SQUARE AND METAL DISC
IT THIS GROUP HAD A ONE AND THIS GROUP HAD A TWO
FOUR PLA FOUR PLASTIC DISC YEAH
MMM HMM I MEAN NO
BECAUSE GRAMS ARE BIG AND THE PAPER CLIP SOME PAPER CLIP THEY BIG
IN THE PAPER C AND PAPER CLIPS ARE WEIGH LESS AND THE BIG AND GRAMS WEIGH M MORE
THEY HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME SOME OF THEM
TO MEASURE UM CORRECTLY NOT LIKE UH LIKE STUPID YEAH
WELL I DO VERY MUCH LIKE ANIMALS
WELL I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE ANIMALS AND
I REALLY LIKE SNOW LEOPARDS
UH I ENJOY READING AND SCIENCE
YEAH W YEAH THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE WASHER AND OR THAT'S THE CHIP AND THAT'S THE WASHER
NO NO NO SOME PEOPLE GOT FOUR SOME PEOPLE GOT TWELVE
WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE DIFFERENT ME UH WEIGHTS SO
I THINK IT I I THINK IT WAS A BETTER IDEA USING GRAMS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEFINITELY HEAVIER
YES BECAUSE THEY WERE LIKE THIS BIG AND THIS WIDE SO
UH WHEN WE USED A GRAM UH Y YES I YES PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT SAN ANSWERS
UH YES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE UM UH MEASUREMENT BALANCE BEAM YEAH
UM YES IT WAS BECAUSE UH I THINK THEY WERE EQUALLY AMOUNT IN OUR HANDS SO
OKAY BYE
UM SCISSORS PENS
YEAH I YEAH ALL ON OUR OWN WE GOT TO PICK WE PICKED PENCILS PENS UM
UM SCISSORS
WELL WE PUT ONE THING WE PUT LIKE A PEN IN ONE AND THEN WE SAW
YEAH THAT'S THE WASHER AND THAT'S THE CHIP
IT'S ALL ABOUT MEASUREMENT MASS
BUT WHEN YOU UM COULD YOU GET A UH DIFFERENT GRAM
OH WELL WITH SOME GRAVEL WE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE BIG PIECES OF GRAVEL
YEAH WE FOUND OUT A HUNDRED
UM IT WENT
NOT YET WELL WE FOUND A HUNDRED WE FOUND OUT THAT THE WHOLE BAG WAS A HUNDRED
YEAH YEAH YEAH BUT WE HAD THIS LITTLE THING THAT IF IT WASN'T EQUAL WE COULD STICK IT ON THE MIDDLE
WELL IT'D BE QUITE HARD
I'D SAY IT WOULD BE A LITTLE OFF BUT IF WE HAD MORE GRAM PIECES THEN I'D SAY IT WOULD BE EQUAL
MAYBE BUT I WAS THINKING TWO CLEMENTINES
OR THREE CLEMENTINES CAUSE SAY CLEMENTINES ARE QUITE SMALL
MY FOOT WOULD OR MY HAND PROBABLY MY HAND
YEAH BUT IT'S ON A GIANT THING SO
THEY'RE WEIGHING UH I THINK HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN GROWN
WE'RE TRYING TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF AN ORANGE
LIKE EVEN A PIECE OF LEAD MIGHT NOT HAVE A OR EVEN A HOLLOW TREE MIGHT HAVE NO WEIGHT
YEAH BUT IF IT'S HOLLOW SO
CAUSE IN ORANGES HONESTLY ABOUT FOUR CLEMENTINES I'D SAY IS THE MASS OF FOUR CLEMENTINES
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT'S A HUNDRED TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT BUT THAT'S ONLY EIGHTY THAT'S EIGHTY GRAMS
THAT'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IT SAYS A HUNDRED GRAMS
SO THERE MUST BE A THIN ONE BEHIND IT
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN PUT THEM IN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THESE ARE EQUAL BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S FIVE
THAT'S A THOUSAND GRAM PIECE
UH TEN WHOA COOL
UH TEN FOR A HUNDRED CAUSE A HUNDRED TIMES A HUNDRED IS A THOUSAND
UH HUN THOUSAND CAUSE THESE ARE ALL ONE HUNDRED AND THESE ARE HUNDRED
AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUNDRED ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE THERE ARE FIVE ROWS OF FIVE
YOU MIGHT USE IT TO MEASURE AN ORANGE
UH PROBABLY THE ORANGE S THING
AND WE PUT IT ON A BALANCE TO SEE HOW MUCH GRAMS IT WAS THEN WE KINDA WRINGED IT OUT AND SAW HOW MUCH AND SO
YEAH WE GOT THAT WET WE PUT IT
THEN WE PUT NOT REALLY IT
IT WEIGHED ONCE
IT WEIGHED ONCE ONCE YEAH ONCE
THREE GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS
THAT'S TELLING ME IT'S WET
IT WEIGHS A LOT REALLY A LOT
IT W THAT'S FIVE THEN TEN
UH BECAUSE IT'S WEIGHS MUCH MORE THAN THE THESE LITTLE THINGS NO IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME
NO THIS IS THE RIGHT SLIDE I THINK
KILO MEANS LIKE SOMETHING
ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND
ONE LITER OF WATER
A L A KILOGRAM
YEP WE'VE AR I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE YEP
TWO THREE FOUR
THE MASS OF THE WATER WAS UH UM THIRTEEN GRAMS
MMM YES I'D SAY
IF AIR WEIGHED UM YOU COULD WELL YES THERE'S ALREADY AIR
YOU COULD SIMPLY
YEAH YEP
HAS A DIFFERENCE OF TWO THESE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF TWO BUT THIS HAS A DIFFERENCE OF FIVE
UM YES THEY'RE WEIGHING THE SAME THING
WELL WE KNEW THAT KNEW THAT FOUR VIALS EQUALED ONE CUP OF WATER NO
I JUST THINK THE CUPS WERE BIGGER BUT SOME OF THE VIALS WERE SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS
YES IT TOOK NINE
WE DISCOVERED THAT UM IT TOOK A LOT MORE FOR GROUP TWO THAN GROUP ONE
WELL WE UM POURED WATER INTO THEM AND INTO
WELL IT'S CALLED A SYRINGE IT SOMETIMES ONLY FILLS UP TO FIFTY OR THIRTY FIVE
WE USED A BE A BEAKER OR A GRADUATED CYLINDER
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE
THAT'S WELL NOT EXACTLY IT BUT
WHEN WE PUT IT IN HERE THEN WHEN WE UM
WELL THESE ARE FIL IMAGINE THESE ARE FILLED UP WITH WATER
BECAUSE YEAH THEY'RE EQUAL THEY'RE BOTH EQUAL I'M GONNA GET
TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS THEY'RE ALL THE SAME THING
AND SIZES UM BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER
TWO HUNDRED MIL MILLILITER VESSELS YEP
YEP THAT'S THE SMALLEST ONE YEP
FIFTY MILLILITERS SYRINGE WE ALREADY SAW THAT SO
BECAUSE IT'S A SODA CAN SODA CANS CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZES SHAPES
N SOMETIMES
WELL THAT'S ONE MILLILITER IT'D TAKE A HUNDRED MILLILITERS TO FILL UP ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS EXACTLY
THE VIAL WELL THE VIAL WAS THIRTY FIVE EXACTLY IT WOULD TAKE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS TO FILL THAT UP
THAT HAS FIFTY BUT OURS HAD THIRTY FIVE
THESE ARE ALL EQUAL UM SO ON
ONE WAIT ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
YEAH DEFINITELY
S SO IT WON'T TOPPLE OUT THE SODA YEAH YEAH
NOT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
I ALREADY SAW THE MILLILITER
YEAH THEY DO IT TELLS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS INSIDE IT
YEP
IT'S CALLED UM OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE
WELL VOLUME IS VOLUME IS
THIS IS THE THE VOLUME IS THIS IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS THIS IS ONE HUNDRED AND THIS IS ONE
CAN WE TAKE A PEEK AT INVESTIGATION FOUR
PROBABLY DOING
I HAVE N I NEVER KNEW THAT
YEAH VIALS
YEAH YES UM MY BREW GROUP HAD GROUP ONE
YEAH AND SO
SYRINGE YEAH BUT THERE WERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYRINGES ONE ONLY WENT TO THIRTY FIVE AND ONE ONLY WENT TO FIFTY
WELL THEY'RE SMALLER AND SO WE HERE'S WHAT
WELL UM MILLIMETERS
TH THE GRADUATED CYLINDER AND WE
WE FILLED UP A PLASTIC CUP FIRST
YEAH UM THEN LET'S GO BACK TO THE SODA CAN
YEAH THEN WE POURED IT INTO
THE SODA CAN AND WE HAD TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE SODA CAN WOULD HOLD
I THINK LIKE FIFTY LIKE THIS BIG
SO THIS ONE'S BIGGER THAN THIS ONE SO THEY PROBABLY GOT LESS THAN WE DID
IF THIS IS TWENTY FIVE THIS IS ABOUT HALF OF THAT SO
THIRTEEN GRAMS
UM PROBABLY ABOUT
A HUNDRED AND TEN OR S
OH A HU NO NO I THINK THEY'LL HAVE MORE THAN WE DO
TH THEY'LL HAVE MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER AND IT WILL TAKE MORE TO FILL UP BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL
UM ME DIFFERENT THAN OURS
TEN BECAUSE TEN TIMES TEN IS A HUNDRED
CAUSE THEY'RE MILLA WHICH KIND OF MEANS SMALL
BECAUSE A SYRINGE CAN HOLD MORE
OR YOU COULD ALSO USE A ONE MILLILITER SPOON
AS IN REALLY REALLY HOT
NEGATIVE TWENTY IS REALLY REALLY COLD
WELL IF YOUR FI FINGER WAS A THERMOMETER YES
YES INSTEAD OF USING FAHRENHEIT WE USED CELSIUS
I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S PUTTING HIS FINGERS AND
BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW MUCH HOW COLD AND HOT IT WAS
IT WAS THE HO WARMEST
WE MIGHT USE A THERMOMETER
UM TWENTY
YEAH WELL COLDER THAN HOT BUT AT LEAST A LITTLE WARM
IT WOULD TURN WARMER BECAUSE THE ROOM IS WARMER THAN OUTSIDE
ICE WATER B WAS OBVIOUSLY THE COLDEST BECAUSE SHE PUT ICE BUT SHE DIDN'T LET THE ICE FALL IN
RESULTS GRAPH NOW WE DIDN'T REALLY GET TO THIS
THE WATER IN THE CUPS YES
UH ICE WATER
YEAH THIS WOULD BE THE DEFINITELY THE COLDEST AND THIS PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THE WARMEST
UM WELL IT GOES DOWN FROM TWENTY UP AND UP TO FIFTEEN
I THINK WELL THE WATER WENT DOWN THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN WHEN YOU PUT ICE IN
NO FIFTEEN MINUTES YES CAUSE IT WENT DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND IT COULD DO IT
TODAY WE JUST MADE THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE THEN WE LOOKED OVER OUR HOMEWORK
WE DID THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED
ABOUT LIKE HOW THE PLANE FLEW AND
ON THE Y AXIS IT'S COUNTING BY ONES AND THE X AXIS IT'S COUNTING BY ONE
THEY'RE EACH COUNTING BY ONES ON THE X AX AND THE Y AX
HOW MUCH WEIGHT IS IT SO LIKE TEN TWENTY YOU COULD TELL LIKE THE WEIGHT AND THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANE
WE DID ONE WITH THE STRING A PAPERCLIP AND A PENNY
WE HAD PARTNERS AND WE PUT IT ON A PENCIL AND HOW FAST IT MOVED
WITH A LONG STRING IT GOES SLOWER AND A SMALLER STRING GOES FASTER
THE LONGER THE STRING GOES SLOWER
IT KEEPS GOING LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT GETS TO BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE
IT GOES TWENTY FIFTEEN THEN TWELVE S
EACH GOES UH A LOW AND FAR
IT THE
GOES TEN
WE'VE BEEN TOUCHING TESTING CERTAIN SIZES OF PENDULUM
PARTNERS SO AND THEN WE TEST THE LONGER IT WAS THE SLOWER THAT IT IS
THE VARIABLES DIDN'T REALLY MUCH CHANGE IN
THE PENDULUM IS MOVING BACK AND FORTH
EACH TIME IT SWINGS IT GOES LOWER AND LOWER
WE'VE BEEN MAKING UH PLANES
THE PLANE'S MOVING WITH FISHING WIRES
IT DOESN'T GO D
WHEN YOU WANT WHEN YOU SPIN THE PROPELLERS IT CATCHES WIND THROUGH THE STRAW SO IT COULD GO FASTER
SO DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE
WELL SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE YOU STICK THE POPSICLE STICK IN AND THAT MAKES IT LOOK MORE LIKE A CATAPULT
WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FLIP STICK YOU CAN'T REALLY FLIP ANYTHING
WELL IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE
YOU COULD FLIP A PENNY YOU COULD FLIP A CORK THE RUBBER CORK UM
MAYBE A BLOCK HAS FALLEN
WELL ONE OF THE OBJECTS WOULD BE THE
THE BASE THE POPSICLE STICK AND THE POPSICLE STICK
CAN'T REALLY FLIP ANYTHING WITHOUT A BASE
BUT NOW IT'S OKAY
WELL THE WELL THE FARTHER IN IT IS THE FARTHER IT WOULD GO LIKE THIS
I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT YET WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT IT ON FRIDAY
NO WE CHANGED IT ONE STEP AT A TIME SO WE WOULDN'T MESS IT UP
POKEMON CARDS
WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS THE VARIABLES ABOUT
NO MARLIE NOT LIFEBOATS JUST BOATS MADE OUT OF PAPER CUPS
WELL THE DIFFERENCE WAS ABOUT
NOT HARD NO NOT HOW HARD HOW MANY
WELL IF YOU JUST PUT A CHUNK IN THE PAPER CUP IT WOULD TECHNICALLY SINK REAL FAST CAUSE WATER WILL GO IN AND WILL START SINKING
MARLIE ARE YOU THERE MARLIE
WELL I THINK A WILL HOLD THE MOST
B WILL HOLD ABOUT TWENTY C WOULD HOLD ABOUT TEN D WOULD HOLD ABOUT SEVEN
WELL IT DEPENDS HOW TALL THEY ARE TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
YOU'RE WELCOME
IT'S GOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
WHAT DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT
OH AND WE USED FISHING WIRE
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE GONNA TWIRL THE OH WHAT'S IT CAL PROP
UM A RUBBER BAND
WELL WE USED POPSICLE STICKS
TEN OR ELEVEN
HOW DID YOU CHANGE IT
THE NUMBER GOES UP HIGHER
DISTANCE GOES HIGHER THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER
UM WHY YOU CHANGED IT HOW AND HOW IT AFFECTED THE PLANE
WE TRIED TO SEE 'EM HOW FAR IT WOULD GO AND WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE TO MAKE IT GO FARTHER
ONE VARIABLE I WANT TO TEST IS MAYBE THE TO TO MAKE THE RUBBER BAND SMALLER
ABOUT VARIABLES
WELL NO
GOOD BYE MARNIE GOOD BYE
HELLO MY NAME IS CARTER
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT UM UH UNITS AND MEASUREMENT
HOW LONG ONE END OF THE OBJECT IS TO THE OTHER
OH NO IT'S UM THE SIZE IS WHEN HOW BIG IT IS AROUND THE OBJECT
THE C AND M STANDS FOR CENTIMETER
UM I THINK LIKE A
WE ARE DOING UH MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION AND A LITTLE BIT OF MEASURING
METERS ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
YOU CAN UM ROUND IT TO THE NEAREST TEN WHICH WILL HELP YOU MAKE MORE UM ACCURATE ESIMATES
UM IT IS WHEN LIKE UM
UM WE USED STANDARD MEASUREMENT WHICH IS METERS AND CENTIMETERS
I HAVE TO GO NOW SO BYE
IF SO LIKE YOU COULD HAVE UM YOU
THE PLASTIC CHIP IS THE SAME WEIGHT AS THE FOUR PAPER CLIPS IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME
I DISCOVERED THAT UM THE UM PLASTIC CHIP UM TOOK
BYE WE HAVE TO GO NOW
UM WE HAVE BEEN DOING ESTIMATING
OR FIND THE WEIGHT OF A WOOD BLOCK
TELLS ME THAT IT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS IN WEIGHT
UM IT'S JUST IT'S JUST UM A WAY OF OF WEIGHING SOMETHING
UM SAY IT'S UM
THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS HEAVY
THE ORANGE IS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET
UM I HAVE TO GO BYE
THE WET SPONGE WAS WELL THEY PUT THE WET SPONGE SIXTEEN GRAMS
THE DRY SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WEIGHING OBJECTS AND FINDING OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE PLASTIC UM CHIP WEIGHS
YOU USE GRAMS
GOOD
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT CIRCUITS YET
I'M NOT SURE BUT WE'VE BEEN STUDYING VOLUME A LITTLE BIT
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LIKE VOLUME AND SOME OTHER WORDS I FORGOT WHAT THEY WERE
SO LIKE
UM THAT'S NOT REALLY I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THAT
YOU COULD PUT WATER IN IT AND THEN MEASURE OUT THE WATER IN A DIFFERENT CONTAINER
GROUP ONE GOT FOUR VIALS AND GROUP TWO GOT NINE VIALS OF WATER
UM LITERS AND MILLILITERS
THE VOLUME OF THE CUP
SHOULDN'T BE BROKEN INTO HALF A LITER OR UM MILLILITERS
IT SHOWS YOU WHERE THE HUNDRED MILLILITERS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND UP TO A THOUSAND MILLILITERS ARE
A THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN ONE LITER
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WE HAVEN'T U USED MILLILITERS YET
WE'VE BEEN DOING VOLUME AND WE HAVE BEEN UM FINDING OUT HOW MUCH WATER IS IN A LIKE A LITTLE CUP
WELL WE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH OUR TEACHER MISTER BONA UM WITH THE CLASS AND THAT'S HOW I FIGURED IT OUT
WELL WE JUST POURED IT INTO ANOTHER WE JUST POURED IT INTO A GRADUATED CYLINDER WE DIDN'T USE THE SYRINGE SO WE JUST POURED IT OUT OF THE CUP
A SYRINGE YOU CAN USE A SYRINGE
WELL I DIDN'T REALLY USE ONE UM SO I I DIDN'T USE ONE
OUR SYRINGES HELD FIFTY MIL MILLILITERS OF WATER
COULD MEASURE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
IT'S LABELLED IN MILLILITERS OF WATER OR JUICE OR WHATEVER YOU'RE MEASURING
TRY AND ESTIMATE LIKE THE LINES IF IT DID HAVE LINES AND MILLILITERS AND THAT'LL HELP YOU
WELL LINE D IS IN WELL LINE D YOU COULD JUST POUR ALL THE WATER INTO THE CUP AND THEN IT GOT TO LINE D
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS UM
WE HAVEN'T DONE CAPACITY YET
CAPACITY WOULD BE LIKE MEASURING LIQUID IN A CUP OR CONTAINER
UM THEY ALL HOLD TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
UM YOU HAVE TO JUST BECAUSE IF ONE CONTAINER IS TALLER THAN ANOTHER ONE DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN HOLD MORE
THE TALL CONTAINER IS PROBABLY UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
I LEARNED THAT UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER CAN FIT IN ALL THESE CONTAINERS
YOU MEASURE WHAT PART OF THE WATER YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE IS THE WATER THAT TAKES UP ROOM IN THE CUP
THE UM THEY HAD SYRINGES SO THEY USED THE SYRINGES TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE WATER
WE TRIED TO SEE IF UM THE SODA COMPANY FILLED THEIR SODA UP TO THE VERY TA ER CAPACITY OF THE CAN
UM WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE IT
IT'S THE CAPACITY
VOLUME IS HOW MUCH LIQUID IS IN THE CONTAINER AT THAT MOMENT AND THEN CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD FULL
UM WELL WE USED THE SYRINGE TO FIGURE OUT AND THE GRADUATED CYLINDER SO IT WAS PRETTY EASY
JUST A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS OF WATER IS HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE CUP
I COULD USE A GRADUATED CYLINDER ADDITION TO THE UM SYRINGE
FIFTY PLUS FIFTY IS ONE HUNDRED SO FIFTY MILLILITERS
TEMPERATURE'S IF Y WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES WOULD BE LIKE YOU'RE HOT OR YOU'RE COLD
HOW HOT AND COLD IT IS
WHAT HOW HOT OR COLD WATER OR A LIQUID IS
UM IT'S NOT
IT'S JUST ON THE STAND IT'S METRIC STANDARD FOR UH MEASURING THE HEAT
UM CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT PROBABLY MOSTLY CELSIUS
UM IN CELSIUS IF IT'S UP BY ONE HUNDRED IT'S HOT IF IT'S DOWN BY ZERO IT'S COLD
IT'S HOT WATER AND THEN THE TEN DEGREE CELS ON THE RIGHT IT'S TEN DEGREES CELSIUS IT'S COLD WATER
IT WOULD BE IN TH BETWEEN UM FIFTY AND TEN TEN DEGREES WHICH WOULD BE THIRTY DEGREES I THINK
WE MEASURED WATER AND SEE HOW HOT AND COLD IT WAS
UM THAT WITH THE THERMOMETER THE UM LITTLE MERCURY WOULD GO DOWN
THE CHANGES HAPPEN WHEN UM YOU PUT SOMETHING COLD OR HOT INTO A CUP LIKE PROBABLY WATER
UH LIKE JUST HOW THE FIRST WAS LIKE ONE MINUTE TWENTY DEGREES TWO MINUTES TEN DEGREES LIKE THAT
HOW LONG IT TOOK AND HOW HOT AND COLD THE WATER GOT
UM IT'S THE TEMPERATURE CELSIUS
IT IS GETTING WELL AT FIRST IT'S GETS REALLY COLD THEN IT GETS HOTTER
IT DROPPED WAY DOWN
IT'S ABOUT SO THAT YOU CAN THEY CAN SHOW YOU WHERE THEY S UM TOOK THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER
IT GETS IT DROPS REALLY COLD AT FIRST BUT THEN IT STARTS TO GET WARMER
WELL IT JUST LIKE UM THE DIFFERENCE IN THERE IS HOW MUCH IT DROPPED THIRTY DEGREES
BY LOOKING AT THE MARKS AND FINDING THE UM SMALLER NUMBER MINUSED FROM THE BIGGER NUMBER
YOU CAN SEE UM IF YOU WATCH CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE THE LINE GO UP OR DOWN
HI MY NAME'S DOMINICK
WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT
YOU KIND OF FIGURE OUT THE LENGTH OF THE DESK OR WIDTH
WHEN I MEASURED MY DESK I USED A RULER
THEY'RE PIPES I THINK THEY'RE EITHER PIPES OR STRAWS
ONE'S REALLY LONG AND ONE'S SHORT
I SEE A LONG STRAW
I NOTICED THAT THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS ARE THE SAME
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER I FORGET KIND OF
I DON'T KNOW I REALLY
SAME OLD SAME OLD WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENTS
YOU MEASURE WITH METERS
THEY ALL END IN METER
A METER IS UM JUST LIKE THE WHOLE STICK
I THINK I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M REALLY SURE THERE'S TEN MILLIMETERS IN A CENTIMETER
CURIOSITY HELPS YOU ESTIMATE
WELL YOU CAN USE YOUR HAND TO MEASURE TEN INCHES NOW THAT I SEE THIS PICTURE
ESTIMATING IS PRETTY MUCH KIND OF GUESSING AND EXAMINING IN ONE
SAY LIKE YOU WANT TO MEASURE TEN CENTIMETERS YOU COULD USE YOUR HAND IF YOU LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A RULER OR OR ANYTHING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT
BYE BYE
GOOD
UH THE EDGES OF THE TABLE CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU DO THAT BY MEASURING TWICE
THE TOOLS THAT WE USED WERE METER TAPE NOW BEAT IT
YOUR PINKIE IS ONE CENTIMETER THICK NOW BEAT IT
WELL LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEASURING TAPE OR ANYTHING THAT CAN MEASURE CENTIMETERS YOU CAN UM UH USE YOUR PINKIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I IF FITS IN WITH THE IDEA OF A REFERENCE BECAUSE UM YOUR PINKIE IS ON THE Y THE WIDTH OF YOUR PINKIE IS ONE CENTIMETER
WELL NOT NOTHIN THE ONLY THING WE'VE MEASURED SO FAR ON PEOPLE ARE THEIR HEIGHT AND THEIR ARM SPAN
I SEE THAT YOUR FOOT IS AS LONG AS YOUR FOREARM
FOR SOME PEOPLE'S BODY PARTS SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE THE SAME LENGTH LIKE LIKE UH THAT PICTURE THE FOREARM AND THE FOOT ARE THE SAME LENGTH
I THINK THE THING THAT MAKES OBJECTS WEIGH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IS UM LIKE UH I DON'T KNOW
WELL WEIGH BECAUSE LIKE I SAID
YOU PUT 'EM ON EACH SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
UM THEN ESTIMATE'S ACTUALLY MEASURING IT MAYBE
UM IT'S SAYING THAT UH METAL DISK WEIGHS AS MUCH AS FOUR PAPER CLIPS WAIT YEAH FOUR
I DISCOVERED THAT IT WEIGHED LESS THAN THE METAL CHIP AND UH I FORGET IF IT WEIGHED MORE OR LESS THAN THE WOODEN CHIP
WE USED PAPER CLIPS I THINK
PAPER CLIPS ONE'S A JUMBO SIZE AND ONE'S A REGULAR SIZE
I NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE NO GRAM DATA
E WE USED GRAM PIECES
IT'S A PICTURE OF A LITTLE CUBE THAT WEIGHS ONE GRAM
UM UH THE METAL DISK UM IS NOT ONE GRAM IT'S NOT TWO IT'S NOT THREE IT'S NOT FOUR IT'S NOT FIVE IT'S NOT SIX
THE PIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FULCRUM
I CAN SAY WAIT HOLD ON
IT MEANS THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE WEIGHING IS IS THE SAME AS EIGHT GRAMS
UH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MASS AND WEIGHT BUT USUALLY MASS
UH I DON'T KNOW
THAT A METAL DISK WEIGHS EIGHT GRAMS
WELL IT TAKES A LOT OF GRAMS IT TAKES SEVENTY GRAMS AND THAT'S A LOT AND YOU HAVE TO FILL IT AND KEEP FILLING IT UP
WAS JUST USING GRAM PIECES IS BECAUSE IT'S THE METRIC STANDARD
UM THAT FIVE TWENTY UH HOLD ON H
MAN MY EAR'S ITCHY
UH WE HAVEN'T LEARNED WHAT TO DO WITH KILOGRAMS REALLY YET KIND OF I WELL IF WE DID I FORGET
YEAH I FOUND OUT THAT THE MASS OF THE BOOT WEIGHS ONE KILOGRAM AND A HUNDRED GRAMS
YOU WOULD EVERYBODY WOULD GET THE SAME ANSWER
WE HAVE BEEN DOING MASS
THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET SO SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE
THE SPONGE ON THE LEFT IS A DRY SPONGE
UM I DON'T KNOW REALLY
THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE WAS WET CAUSE IT HAS JUST BEEN SOAKED
YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS FULL WHEN IT GETS PUFFY AND PUFFIER AND PUFFIER AND PUFFIER AND PUFFIER
I NOTICE THAT THE SPONGE ON THE RIGHT IS BEING SOAKED IN WATER
UM THE IT'S A SPONGE IN A BALANCE
I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE WEIGHS THREE GRAMS
I FIGURED OUT ON THE MASS OF THE DRY SPONGE THAT IT WEIGHS THREE GRAMS
THE WET SPONGE WEIGHED SIXTEEN GRAMS
IT RELATES TO THE DIFFERENCE YEAH
YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE THE PLASTIC DISK OR THE METAL DISK THAT ROBOT'S FROM ROBOT
UM SO WE USED A BALANCE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEAVY SOMETHING IS WHAT YEAH YEAH YEAH WHAT
YOU COULD USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE MASS OF SOMETHING AND I THINK I'VE PRETTY MUCH DID MATH AND WEIGHT
INSTEAD OF METRIC UNIT WE USE IS UM UH GRAMS YEAH
WELL UM WE'VE BEEN DOING VOLUME AND CAPACITY SO CAUSE LIKE
VOLUME IS THE AMOUNT OF MATTER THAT TAKES UP SPACE IN SOMETHING
IT TELLS YOU THAT WELL I FORGET A ACTUALLY
WE USED A SYRINGE WATER IN VIAL IN A VIAL
ONE'S BIG AND ONE'S SMALL
SO WHEN WE USED THE VIALS TO MEASURE WATER UM UH
IT MIGHT AFFECT THEM BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS
IT'S A LITER THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S A KILOLITER AND LITER
YOU COULD MEASURE UM HOW MUCH WATER IS IN A LITER
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASIER AND IT'S UH AND IT'S THE METRIC STANDARD
WELL IT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO MILLILITERS CAUSE LIKE THERE A MILLILITER IS ONE ONE THOUSANDTH OF A LITER
SO A MILLILITER IS ONE ONE THOUSANDTHS OF A LITER
IT'S TELLING YOU THAT A METER IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS I MEAN A LITER IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS
THERE ARE A THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER
IT'S THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO MEASURE THE VOLUME OF THAT ARE LESS THAN A LITER
BECAUSE THEY'RE SPECIFIC THEY'RE KIND OF SPECIFIC FOR MEASURING LIQUIDS AND VOLUME
WHAT MAKES 'EM USEFUL IS IS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MEASURE AND THEY WORK VERY WELL
ALL THE LINES ON THE SYRINGE REPRESENT AN AMOUNT OF MILLIMETERS
GOOD
WHEN YOU WHAT WAIT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
THAT IS A SYRINGE YEAH THAT'S A SYRINGE TO FAMILY
THE LINES ON A SYRINGE TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER ARE ARE UM LIKE BACKED UP IN IT
BUT YEAH THAT'S THE USUAL THING I THINK
THAT TOOL IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER
INSTEAD OF GOING TO FIFTY MILLILITERS IT GOES UP TO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
UM UH IT'S LABELLED UM WITH A HUNDRED MILLILITERS NOT
UM YOU MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF LIQUID UM IN MILLILITERS
SINCE TO LINE B UM IS FIFTY MILLILITERS THAT'S HALFWAY IF D'S TO THE TOP D IS A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
OR YOU CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO TELL YOU THAT LIKE UM UH LIKE UM IS A STAND
CAPACITY IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIQUID THAT A CONTAINER CAN HOLD
YOU SHOULD MEASURE UM LIKE UH WELL I GUESS YOU SHOULD REALLY MEASURE UM WAIT HOLD ON REPEAT REPEAT
I OBSERVED THAT THE CUP ON THE LEFT IS FULL THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IS HALF WAY FULL
I DISCOVERED THAT LIKE UM FOR THE CAPACITY UM UH WELL I GUESS LIKE
WELL I DISCOVERED THAT LIKE THERE IS MORE CAPACITY IN ONE CONTAINER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE'S FULL AND THE OTHER ONE ISN'T
YOU LOOK AT THE WATER LEVEL AND TRY TO SEE WHERE THE WHERE LIKE THE BOTTOM OF THE IS
UM THESE ARE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSEL VESSEL CONTAINERS
UM I SEE THAT THE CONTAINER CAN HOLD UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WA
I NOTICED THAT IT'S NOT F FILLED TO THE TOP
THAT TELLS YOU THE VOLUME OF HOW MUCH UM SODA IS IN THE CAN
WELL IT COMPARES WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT THAT WELL
IT STANDS FOR THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
IT COMPARES BECAUSE LIKE WELL I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW IT COMPARES THAT MUCH
WELL I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT ANSWERS
IT'S I THINK WELL THE CUP WAS FILLED TO THE TOP SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP
I WOULD USE EITHER A LITER BEAKER UM A SYRINGE OR A GRADUATED CYLINDER
WELL USING THE SYRINGE IS A GOOD WAY TO UH MEASURE
FIFTY MILLILITERS
WELL TO FIGURE OUT CAPACITY YOU COULD USE A GRADUATED CYLINDER OR JUST STICK WITH THE SYRINGE
WELL YOU COULD MEASURE THEM WITH THE GRADUATED CYLINDER
YOU NEED THEM UM UH FOR LIKE UH WELL YOU WOULD NEED THEM FOR
UM WE'VE BEEN LIKE UM MEASURING TEMPERATURE
TEMPERATURE IS THE DEGREES OF UM HOW COLD OR HOW HOT SOMETHING IS
AFTER WE USED OUR FINGERS WE USED THE THERMOMETER
UM WELL IT CAN CONNECT BY LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE HEAT JUST LIKE A THERMOMETER DOES
S THE C ON THE THERMOMETERS MEANS CELSIUS
CELSIUS OR FAHRENHEIT
UM WELL LIKE DEGREE CELSIUS IS THE METRIC SO UM UH IT'S THE METRIC WAY OF MEASURING
FORGET UM WAIT HOLD ON
YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING IS HOT OR COLD BY UM UH THE DE BY THE DEGREES OF WHERE IT'S GOING AND STUFF
UM YOU WILL GET THE NUMBER THAT THE EITHER MERCURY OR ALCOHOL IS AT
WELL THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE COLDER CAUSE THE ONES ON THE RIGHT ARE A LOT WARMER
UM I DON'T KNOW REALLY ANY OBSERVATION
UM IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY IT WELL IT WAS REALLY COLD
I DISCOVERED THAT IT GETS REALLY COLD
I NOTICED THAT THE ICE STARTS TO MELT AND THE WATER GOT COLDER
UM WELL I FORGET
WELL THE CHANGES HAPPEN AFTER A COUPLE MINUTES
UM IT GETS A LITTLE WARMER
THAT IS COLDER SORRY I ACCIDENTALLY SAID WARMER
WELL AT THE START IT'S AT TWENTY DEGREES AND AT THE END IT'S AT FIVE
UM UH I DON'T KNOW REALLY
THE LIQUID UM EXPANDS
WELL YOU CAN SHOW YOUR TEMPERATURE DATA BY WELL YOU COULD MAKE A CHART
WELL WHAT WE DID IS WE HAVE LIKE THESE LITTLE THERMOMETER SHEETS AND WE WROTE IT DOWN ON IT
WELL WHAT I WELL LIKE I JUST WROTE DATA ON A SHEET OF PAPER WROTE IT DOWN THAT'S ALL I DID
WELL THE PARTS OF THE GRAPH ARE LIKE JUST THEY JUST RECORD IT WITH DOTS
I SEE ALL THE DATA DOTS AND LINES
HOW COLD THE WATER GOT
UM THAT IT THE LOWEST IT WAS WAS FIVE DEGREE
IT GETS COLDER WELL IT GETS HIGHER AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES IT GOT VERY LOW
WELL UM YOU CAN JUST LIKE ADD IT ALL UP AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WELL UM YOU CAN JUST FIGURE OUT BY LOOKING AT HOW MANY NUMBERS IT CHANGED BY REALLY
UM WELL THEY'RE ALL AT DIFFERENT UM DEGREES
UH AT DIFFERENT DEGREES LIKE ONE'S FIFTY FIVE ONE'S A HUNDRED ONE'S FIVE AND ONE'S TWENTY
I NEVER HAD A BOY
GOTTA GET MY HAIR OUT OF MY
WELL PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW ME THE BEST NO I'M JUST KIDDING
E YEAH I WAS LIKE IT TOOK FOREVER
BECAUSE IT WOULD USE SO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND STUFF RIGHT
UH-HUH YEAH
WHY ARE WE PROGRAMMING MY VOICE ONTO THE COMPUTER
HELLO
NO THAT'S NOT HOW IT IS I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE THEY JUST MAKE IT LIKE SO HARD TO MEMORIZE
WELL THERE'S A LETTER AND THERE'S ALSO A NUMBERS THAT YOU COULD DO THERE'S ALSO
N NO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S JUST A DOT I JUST DON'T REMEMBER
OH I THOUGHT ONE WAS JUST A DOT
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE MY MOM WAS ONE FIVE FIVE NINE SEVEN NINE NINE EIGHT FIVE FOUR SO IF I DREW IT OUT TO YOU IT WOULD BE LIKE
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY AND UM NEXT WEEK WE'RE GONNA LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
WELL WHAT WE DID TODAY WAS UM WE WENT AROUND OUR CLASSROOM TO SEE WHAT UM A MAGNET COULD STICK TO
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT WAS TO SEE WHAT WE COULD FIND UM THAT A MAGNET WOULD STICK TO LIKE IRON OR METAL
THERE WAS A NAIL A ROCK UM A RUBBER BAND SPONGE WIRE MESH UM A COUPLE OF NAILS AND A STRAW
THE MAGNET STUCK TO AN IRON NAIL UM THE WIRE MESH UH THE PAPER CLIP AND THE
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS RECENTLY WE WERE EXPERIMENTING WHAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND WHAT DOESN'T
A CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU HAVE WIRES THAT GO AROUND THAT COMPLETES THE ELECTRIC FLOW SO THAT IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE
WELL WHAT THAT DOES IS CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO MAKE WHATEVER YOU'RE USING WORK
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF SOME SORT OF METAL AND IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS SO THAT THE MOTOR WILL WORK
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS SO THAT UM THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WILL FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
UM ANYTHING THAT IS MADE OF IRON WILL WORK OR ANY JUST PRETTY MUCH ANY KINDA STEEL OR METAL WILL WORK
YES I DO IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF WON'T ALLOW THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO FLOW
YOU COULD ALSO CONNECT THE WIRES TO MAKE IT WORK
SWITCH IS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT SO THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE CIRCUIT IS U
AND THEN WHEN YOU BY THE SWITCH IT WILL ALLOW THE UM
THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH JUST A BASIC ONE THAT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
THE PICTURE THAT I'M SEEING IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE METAL IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER UM I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT WIRE OUTLET TO MAKE IT WORK
THE WAY TO GET IT TO WORK WOULD BE TO JUST TAKE THE LEVER AND MOVE IT OVER TO WHERE THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THAT PIECE OF METAL
O IF YOU WANTED TO COMPLETE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY YOU WOULD USE SOME SORT OF C
OR ANOTHER WIRE BUT AN INSULATOR WOULD NOT LET THE
IT TURNS AROUND THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS FLOWING THROUGH ONLY THOUGH IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
WELL IT'S THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE ONLY THOUGH THEY'RE USING A MOTOR IN THIS ONE AND IT STILL HAS THE
WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM WITH THE REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN FIT TWENTY ONE WASHERS INTO THE OTHER CUP BEFORE BREAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD
DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD FLOW THROUGH TO KEEP IT HELD SO THAT THE BALANCE WOULDN'T BREAK
WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED STICKERS AND WE PUT EM ON A GRAPH TO SHOW UM HOW MANY SPACERS THAT WE COULD USE BEFORE THE MAGNETIC FIELD BROKE
MMM THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT CAUSE THE MORE SPACES THAT YOU ADDED THE LESS UM MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAD SO THE LESS WASHERS YOU CAN FIT INTO THE CUP
TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU PUT UM S THINGS OR IN THIS CASE SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE LESS MAGNETIC FORCE IT HAS
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAPHING THE INFORMATION IS TO SEE WHAT CHANGES AS THE MORE SPACERS THAT YOU PUT AND HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL GET
UM NO NOT ALL OF US DID BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY COMPARE THE RESULTS THAT EACH GROUP GOT
UM YES WE DID WE HAD A SCALE WITH A BAG OF WASHERS AND ALSO FIVE SPACERS TO USE AND OF COURSE THE MAGNETS
UM FOR THIS EXPERIMENT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE STANDARDS
WHAT WE FOUND WAS UM THE INFORMATION ON HOW STRONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS
TODAY WE DID OUR FIRST THING UH OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT ON ELECTRICITY
WE GOT A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND TRIED TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB WITH THOSE MATERIALS
THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT
A CIRCUIT IS WHEN ELECTRICITY GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE
A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
IT'S A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE AN OUTLET EVERY TIME
E IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
TO SEE HOW THE ENERGY LIGHTS IT UP WHEN IT'S FLOWING THROUGH
THE S IT THE ENERGY WASN'T FLOWING THE CIRCUIT RIGHT FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT RIGHT
SEEING WHAT WAS CONDUCTORS AND WHAT WASN'T A CONDUCT AND WHAT WAS A WHAT WASN'T A AN INSULATOR
THEY'RE SOMETHING THAT ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH
SOMETHING THAT ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH
WELL THERE'S A SWITCH A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR A LIGHT A LO A WIRE AND A BASE
YOU FLIP IT UP IT IS OFF BUT WHEN YOU FLIP IT DOWN IT IS ON
THE END OF THE WIRE OR METAL
THIS IS A SCHEMATIC DRAWING OF THE BATTERY POWERING THE LIGHT BULB
THERE'S ENERGY STORED IN THE BATTERY AND IT IS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
BOUT MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
THAT THE OPPOSITE POLES STICK TOGETHER AND THE SAME POLES REPEL
THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD AND THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD
WHEN IT ATTRACTS IT'LL STAY TOGETHER WHEN IT REPELS THEY WILL TRY AND GO APART
WE'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE ENDS ON EM MEAN NORTH AND THE ONES THAT HAVE S'S ON THEM MEAN SOUTH
YES
BY EXPERIMENTING IN THE CLASSROOM
BECAUSE THE ROCK HAD IRON IN IT
BECAUSE I THOUGHT MOST METAL STUCK TO IRON ER STUCK TO MAGNETS
STUDIED ABOUT E ELECTRICITY
JUST THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A SERIES THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT
THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE PO THROUGH THE LIGHTS AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE END
USING IN A PARALLEL SERIES CIRCUIT
THE BATTERY FLIPS OVER
IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
THE FLOW SWITCHES AROUND AND GOES THE OTHER WAY
IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
IT ONLY FLOWS IN ONE DIRECTION
THERE'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW
THIS IS A SCHEMATIC DRAWING OF A SERIES CIRCUIT
THIS IS ANOTHER SCHEMATIC DRAWING BUT THE ER BATTERY'S TRYING TO LIGHT TWO MOTORS INSTEAD OF LIGHTS
IT CAN MAKE ELECTRICITY
THEY CAN LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL FASTER
SOMETHING LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AROUND WITH THE MATCH LIGHTING A BUNCH OF TORCHES OR SOMETHING
WE WERE CONNECTING A BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB AND TRY TO MAKE IT TURN THE LIGHT BULB ON
ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE MAGNET IS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB IS AN ELECTRICITY RECEIVER
A CIRCUIT IS LIKE A PATHWAY
A PATHWAY FOR SOMETHING TO GO THROUGH IT TO GET TO ANOTHER PLACE
YES IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE AND GO AROUND THAT WIRE AND THEN IT HAS TO KEEP ON GOING THAT WAY
YES BECAUSE THEN IT MIGHT NOT LIGHT UP THERE YOU EITHER PUT IT YOU MOSTLY PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM
IT GOES TO WHERE THE FIRST WIRE WAS
INSIDE THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS
THE MOTOR IS THE RECEIVER AND IT'S RECEIVING THE ENERGY WHILE THE B BATTERY IS GIVING IT TO IT
THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY IS BRINGING MOST OF THE ENERGY TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE
THE PAD THAT HOLDS THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE IT GO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT WON'T MOVE THE LIGHT IT WON'T TURN THE LIGHT BULB ON AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR GO AROUND
CONDUCTORS WILL DO IT THEY WILL MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT THEY WILL MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE
INSULATORS TAKE AWAY THINGS THEY WILL MAKE IT NOT WORK AND THEN CONDUCTORS WILL BRING IT IN
MOST METAL THINGS WITH LIKE MOST METAL THINGS WILL ATTRACT IT AND MOST THINGS THAT AREN'T METAL WON'T ATTRACT IT
CONDUCTORS WILL ATTRACT IT WHEN YOU PUT A METAL THING ON IT USUALLY WILL ATTRACT IT AND IT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT KEEP ON GOING AROUND
INSULATORS WILL STOP THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY WILL PUSH THE POWER AWAY INSTEAD OF TAKE IT AND PUT IT INTO THE MOTOR
THE POWER IS GOING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE P MOTOR
ALLY THE INSULATORS WERE NOT PUTTING ALL THE POWER THROUGH BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FORCE TO THEY WILL PU PUT IT OUT
CONDUCTORS WILL TAKE ALL OF THE POWER INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN THE INSULATORS WILL PUSH IT AWAY
I THOUGHT IT WAS SURPRISING THAT MOST OF THE ROCKS DIDN'T MAKE IT GO THROUGH AND INTO THE MOTOR
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE CIRCUITS THE POWER IN YOUR HOUSE WON'T WORK
WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERY IT WILL ALL STAY THE SAME UNLESS THE BATTERY'S POWER IS OUT
UNLESS YOU TURN THE BATTERY THE OTHER WAY IT WILL THE CIRCUIT WILL GO THE OTHER WAY
THE CIRCUIT WILL GO UP THROUGH THE WIRES UNTIL IT HITS THE MOTOR
MAGNETISM MAGNETS CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL BUT NOTHING ELSE THAT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL
THE NAIL ISN'T IS GOING DOWN BUT IT'S NOT AT
TO THE UM THE PAPER CLIP
ALL THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY IS GOING THROUGH ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN GOING TO THE OTHER AND THEN GOING BACK
MAYBE ADD ANOTHER BATTERY AND THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY
BECAUSE IT'S GOING NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE AND IT'S MAKING IT GO IN A CIRCUIT AROUND
THE ONE BULB THAT'S LEFT WILL SHINE REALLY BRIGHTLY
THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAD THE LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF HAVING THE LIGHT BULB THERE YOU COULD PUT THE SWITCH THERE
WHEN YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY THE LIGHTS ARE DIM BUT WHEN YOU ADD THE SECOND BATTERY THEY GET BRIGHT
IF YOU ADDED ANOTHER ANOTHER BULB TWO MIGHT BE BRIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER ONE MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIM
THE BATTERY IS GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE MOTORS GO AROUND AND THEN IT'S GOING AROUND BACK TO THE BATTERY
YES
IT WOULDN'T BE TOO BRIGHT BUT IT WILL STILL SHINE
THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERIES ARE GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THEY'RE MAKING THEM SHINE BRIGHTLY
THIS IS A SERIES
I HAVE LEARNED THAT GOES NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE BEFORE I THOUGHT IT COULD JUST GO ANY WAY
THE RIVET IS FOR WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED YOU CAN PICK UP METAL THINGS AS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
ELECTROMAGNETS ARE BIG MAGNETS THAT PICK UP CARS AND THE STUFF IN THE JUNKYARD
IF YOU WRAPPED THE RIVET AROUND IF YOU WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET MORE IT WILL PICK UP MORE
IF YOU USED TWO BATTERIES IT PROBABLY WOULD PUT MORE POWER INTO THE RIVET
I LEARNED THAT THEY COULD PICK UP CARS AND THAT THEY WERE REALLY BIG MAGNETS
IT ONLY USUALLY PICKS UP IRON
HI GOOD
YEAH A D CELL BATTERY YEAH
UM WE HAD TO CONNECT THE TWO WIRES ONTO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN THE THE OTHER END OF THE TWO BATTERIES INTO THE LIGHT BULB
NO THE OTHER END OF THE TWO UM WIRES
UM THEY'RE THE TWO WIRES THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
UM WE PUT THE UM D CELL BATTERY RIGHT RIGHT HERE
YEAH AFTER WE JUST DID THE THE BATTER
UM OUR TEACHER EXPLAINED US IT YEAH SO
NO THAT WE JUST KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE GOING THERE
UM I THINK MAYBE MA MY PARTNER WASN'T HOLDING IT GOOD OR SOMETHING BUT
IT WOULD JUST BE ON AND YEAH
MAYBE OH BECAUSE MAYBE GLASS THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW THROUGH IT
SOMETHING THAT I WAS TOLD BUT I DON'T KNOW YEAH
IT'S FLOWING LIKE IN A CIRCLE OR
LIKE IF THERE WASN'T ANY OF THESE UM IT WOULDN'T WORK
UM YEAH I COULD ER
I MEAN I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING BUT IT'S JUST THE THE BATTERY UM TURNED AROUND OR LIKE YEAH
IT'S GOING THIS WAY INSTEAD OF THAT WAY
WE UM LIKE WE PUT THE BATTERY HERE AND THERE WAS TWO WIRES I THINK THIS IS ONE
YEAH IT'S THE SAME THING YOU HAVE TO CONNECT IT TO UM THE NEG NE UM NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES
THE NEGATIVE UM NO THE UM ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOES T TO THROUGH THE POSITIVE ER YEAH
AND IT GOES IN THROUGH POSITIVE YEAH
NO OR I DON'T THINK SO I'M NOT SO SURE
OKAY
UM WELL THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH IN A CIRCULAR SYSTEM AND IT WILL BE CUT OFF IF IT'S NOT TOGETHER
THAT IT WILL WORK EITHER WAY IF IT IS ON THE SIDE OR ON THE TOP
UM I'M NOT SURE
UM WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE CIRCUITS TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND MAKE MOTORS RUN
THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND THERE ARE THREE WIRES
THERE ARE TWO BULBS IN T THEY YEAH
THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
IF THEY WEREN'T CONNECTING THEN IT WOULD CUT OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT W THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
UM YOU COULD USE YOU COULD USE TWO BATTERIES
UM I THINK THAT'S WELL THERE'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS AND A SCHEMATIC DRAWING AND IT'S LIGHTING THEM UP
THIS ONE IS THE WAIT WHAT'S THAT
THIS OWN ONE WAS HAS ONLY ONE BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
OH THE M IS THE MOTOR AND SO THE BATTERY IS LIGHTING UP BOTH THE MOTOR AND THE LIGHT BULB
BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR CONNECTING OR ELSE THEY IT WON'T WORK WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTING TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS
UM THEY HAVE TO CONNECT BY THE BOTTOM
UM THEY'RE PROBABLY IS BUT I TOTALLY FORGET
EH YEAH THAT'S IT OKAY THE INSULATOR AND
UM IT IS ACTUALLY THE METAL AT THE BOTTOM THAT WILL CONDUCT THE ELECTRICITY
THE IT'S SAYING HOW MUCH WHAT IT
UM YEAH PRETTY YEAH
UM THAT THE MORE SPACE IN BETWEEN THEM MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT AND ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER
YES UM I DIDN'T THINK THAT WELL
UM YES I LEARNED THAT MAGNETS ARE VERY STRONG AND THAT THEY CAN ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS
I'M SORRY REPEAT THAT
ELECTRICITY TO FLOW
UM WELL THE BATTERY IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS
UM THE CIRCUIT I IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO
UM CHOCOLATE

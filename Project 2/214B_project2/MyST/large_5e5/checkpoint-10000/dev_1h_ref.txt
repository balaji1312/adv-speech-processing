Line_0	I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND KINETIC ENERGY
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	ARE SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I THINK I NEVER MIND
Line_6	IS A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT
Line_7	KINETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THIS
Line_10	THE NEGATIVITY SIDE
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COURSE
Line_14	VERY AWESOMENESS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_16	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	CAUSE IT IS NOT A FULL COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY
Line_25	THE METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH YOU KNOW THAT FUNKY STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPERCLIP BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE POPSICLE WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT YOU JUST ESTABLISHED THAT
Line_30	MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T MADE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CANNOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL METAL
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	AND BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW ALSO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	WE OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAX IS MELT
Line_38	THE WICK WHICH THE THING AND MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING
Line_40	IS BURNING AND FLAMING IN HEAT
Line_41	USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING GOING ON A BUT SHE'S ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	AND IS PRODUCING IT OFF GIVING IT ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS THE ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HEAR SOUND BECAUSE OF THAT
Line_44	THOSE WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANY WAY
Line_45	WELL BURN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS SOLAR POWERED CAR
Line_47	IT WILL COME FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR PANEL SO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THAT TRANSFERRING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	OKAY CAN WE SKIP THIS
Line_49	NON-REUSABLE
Line_50	IT IS ONLY ONE TIME USE AND COAL IS JUST AND COAL IT'S CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONG TIME
Line_51	VERY WELL NOT IT'S GETTING IT I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_54	I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D-CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY
Line_59	WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE
Line_60	THAT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_61	THEY ARE FLYING IN A CIRCUIT AND THERE ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_63	NOTICED THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING INTO AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	OKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A
Line_65	YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK
Line_66	OH NO AS
Line_67	NO
Line_68	BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPER CONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	I DON'T KNOW
Line_73	I'M SORRY AND BUSY YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BUSY REALLY BUSY YEAH
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINIUM WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS ALUMINIUM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END
Line_78	THE I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T WANT REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE LET ME HURRY UP
Line_79	STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONDUCTORS
Line_80	I'M COLOR BLIND I AM COLOR BLIND SO I DON'T REALLY WHICH IS GREY
Line_81	METALLIC ELEMENTS
Line_82	THEY ARE VERY MEDIC AND VERY METALLIC
Line_83	MAGNETS
Line_84	THEY WOULD BE REPEL OBVIOUSLY
Line_85	AH I
Line_86	IT'S SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
Line_87	THEY ARE SIMILAR BE WHAT THEY WERE NEVER MIND CAN WE MOVE ON
Line_88	SOME ARE REPELLING AND SOME ARE ATTRACTING THE END END OF THE STORY I LEARNED A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Line_89	A PERSON WITH A COMPASS
Line_90	BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISM
Line_91	IT IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_92	BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
Line_93	BECAUSE THEY OPPOSITE POLES AND OPPOSITE POLES ATTRACT
Line_94	MAGNITUDE IT'S HARD FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK
Line_95	IT IS NOT STICKING
Line_96	BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_97	THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
Line_98	METAL AND MAGNETISM
Line_99	ON A MAGNET
Line_100	MAGNETISM
Line_101	IT WOULD NOT BE MAGNETISM THAT NO MORE LONG AND STUFF
Line_102	NOT VERY MUCH
Line_103	MAGNETISM
Line_104	THE FLOW OF MAGNETISM IS GOING TO
Line_105	MAGNETIC FORCE STICK IT TO
Line_106	AND THE MAGNET TURNS OFF IT TURNS OFF IT SHOW TUDO
Line_107	MAGNETISM
Line_108	DON'T KNOW DON'T CARE
Line_109	IT IS HAPPENING
Line_110	I OBSERVED THAT THE SPACERS ARE LIKE PREVENTING THE MAGNETIC FIELD YOU KNOW
Line_111	MOVE
Line_112	MAGNETIC
Line_113	SPREADING APART
Line_114	MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_115	MY MIND IS BLOWN BY
Line_116	SPACERS
Line_117	WORKING JOYFULLY
Line_118	MAGNETIC FORCE MAGNETS
Line_119	HOW CAN I PUT THEM TOGETHER PLEASE TELL ME
Line_120	THEN SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN I GUARANTEE IT
Line_121	I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE YOU PROUD OF ME MORE
Line_122	I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL I DID SAY THAT AT ALL HAHAHA
Line_123	MAGNETISM
Line_124	A STEEL RIVET
Line_125	BECAUSE I'M HAPPY TU DO DO MARKERS
Line_126	GREAT THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T WORKING BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HIT THE SWITCH GET IT
Line_127	IT'S NOT A MAGNET ANY MORE OH MY GOSH
Line_128	SORRY THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES WE'VE BEEN ALLOWED WE'VE LOAD YOU'RE HURTING ME
Line_129	DAVID'S DAVID'S FLIRTING WITH A GIRL
Line_130	DAVID WAS FLIRTING WITH A GIRL DAVID WAS FLIRTING WITH A HEY DAVID IS FLIRTING WITH A GIRL
Line_131	REPEAT THIS
Line_132	EVERYTHING THIS IS CD AND YOU
Line_133	TUTUTO SHOW UP YOUR BUTTON
Line_134	WRAP IT AS CHEESE
Line_135	EVERYTHING
Line_136	I'M GOOD TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	ARE WIRES AND THEY THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UM TO LIGHT THE BATTERY TO NO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY IN A CIRCUIT
Line_141	THEY TRANSFER THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMS IT INTO LIGHT
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STUCK BY THE
Line_146	THE ENERGY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS IN BOTH WAYS EITHER THOUGH THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCHED
Line_149	I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASING AND THE BULB
Line_151	WE HAVE LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES
Line_152	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE MOTOR
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM STORED ENERGY TO KINETIC ENERGY
Line_155	IT COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	THE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BOARD
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECT ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FACING THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SOLAR CELL IS
Line_165	THE WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T RUN
Line_167	WHEN THERE'S NO SUN THERE IS WHEN THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT OF THE
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THING
Line_171	A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
Line_172	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
Line_173	ALL METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_174	ALL OF THE METALS IN THE LIST ARE CONDUCT ARE DO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_175	ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_176	THE CIRCUIT RUNS
Line_177	I MAKE A CLOSED CIRCUITS
Line_178	ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_179	THEY CIRCULATE WITH AN INSULATOR INSULATES ELECTRICITY THEREFORE THE INSULATOR THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_180	INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METALS THEREFORE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_181	THE MOTOR DOESN'T RUN
Line_182	WHEN ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
Line_183	CLOSED
Line_184	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_185	THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
Line_186	GOOD
Line_187	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_188	IT POWERS THE THINGS LIKE TOASTER AND COMPUTERS
Line_189	I SEE THAT CANDLE BURNING IN THE WAX MELTING
Line_190	THE CANDLE MELTS
Line_191	IT SO VERY HOT
Line_192	THEY HAVE NO SOUND
Line_193	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES
Line_194	IT HAS EVERYTHING FROM CARS TO TOASTERS
Line_195	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE WAX MELTING
Line_196	THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THEREFORE THE WAX IS MELTING
Line_197	THERE WAS NO SOUND
Line_198	SINCE THE PERSON IS HITTING THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUMS IT'S MAKING SOUND
Line_199	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THEREFORE SHE WILL NEED ENERGY FROM THE APPLE TO EAT
Line_200	CANDLE APPLES WOOD AND SIX GALLONS OF FUEL
Line_201	IT GETS BLACK AND FOGGY
Line_202	THE SOLAR CELL DOESN'T EMIT SMOKE BUT THE GASOLINE DOES
Line_203	THE NAME FOR NON-RENEWABLE FUELS IS FOSSIL FUELS
Line_204	THEY CAN BE USED FOREVER
Line_205	THEY WORK ON
Line_206	THEY BURN AND THEY GIVE LOT OF SMOKE
Line_207	ONE IS LIQUID AND ANOTHER IS A SOLID
Line_208	THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR THEY WILL POLLUTE THE EARTH THEY WILL POLLUTE THE EARTH
Line_209	THE SOLAR PANEL WILL DON'T GIVE UP ANY SMOKE BUT THE COAL AND THE GAS GIVES US SMOKE
Line_210	THAT'LL CREATE SMOG THAT IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENTS
Line_211	YOU IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND AT ALL IT'LL RUN OUT IF YOU USE IT TOO MUCH
Line_212	COAL GAS AND OIL
Line_213	A PARALLEL IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_214	SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_215	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES IN ENERGY AND TAKES OUT ENERGY
Line_216	TWO TWO TWO TWO TWO
Line_217	I NEED HELP
Line_218	THEY ALL HAVE TWO BATTERIES YEAH
Line_219	THE ENERGY HAS TO GOES THROUGH MANY MANY MORE WIRES THEREFORE THE ENERGY WILL LOSE
Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRES
Line_221	OF COURSE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES
Line_222	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE OF POLES
Line_224	THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_225	THE MAGNETS ARE RAPPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_226	THE SIMILARITY OF MAGNETS ARE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER ARE THAT
Line_227	EARTH MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_228	THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT THE COMPASS THAT USES THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC POLES
Line_229	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND OTHER STUFF
Line_230	WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_231	THE MAGNETIC FIELDS GO THROUGH A PAPER THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPERCLIP THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_232	THE FIRST THIN STACK THE POWER CAN GO THROUGH IT BUT WITH THE THICK STACK IT CAN'T
Line_233	IT WORKED THICK
Line_234	THE THINK STACK IT WILL GOES THROUGH WAS A THICK STACK IT WON'T GO
Line_235	THERE IS THICK STACK OF PAPER THE PAPERCLIP CANNOT GO THROUGH
Line_236	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING THE STEEL NAIL AND THE STEEL NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER
Line_237	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_238	MAGNET STICKS
Line_239	MAGNET NO STICK
Line_240	WHITE MAGNETS
Line_241	WASHERS
Line_242	MORE WASHERS COMING TO THE RIGHT SIDE
Line_243	SLIT MAGNETS
Line_244	DETRACT NO REPEL
Line_245	LET'S STILL APPLY
Line_246	REPRESENTS SPACERS
Line_247	LOW LOW LOW
Line_248	IT MAKES THE IT MAKES IT LESS WASHERS
Line_249	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A ELECTRO MAGNETS AND FINDING OUT HOW THEY WORK
Line_250	TO MAKE IT WRAP TIGHTLY A LOT
Line_251	ELECTROMAGNET POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
Line_252	YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT AROUND A LOT
Line_253	ELECTRICITY MAGNETS ON
Line_254	THERE SWITCH
Line_255	CLOSE
Line_256	ELECTRICITY MOVING
Line_257	THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_258	HOOK UP OH HO
Line_259	TURNS MAGNET
Line_260	CLOSE SWITCH ON OPEN SWITCH OFF
Line_261	BLAH
Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTORS
Line_263	THERE ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT THE D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_264	THESE HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER A
Line_265	IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THERE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFER AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THE ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILAMENT IN THERE GET SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY'S COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_277	REPRESENT THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_279	WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULB WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THINK THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT POINTS WOULD NOT GET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN OFF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	SINCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT UM SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IS HAPPENING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT POINTS
Line_289	BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT'S OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN'T FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	THE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUNS LIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR CELL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY FOR FOR IT TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE NOW THERE'S ENERGY
Line_302	WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	PICTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUIT OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SOME ARE CONDUCTORS SOME ARE INSULATORS
Line_306	ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL IF YOU PUT AN INSULATOR ON THE
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THIS POPSICLE STICK DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	INSULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE AN OLD LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	IT'LL STOPS RUNNING
Line_313	THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY LIGHTING LIKE A PATHWAY
Line_314	ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS IN TO MOTION OR LIGHT OR SOUND
Line_315	A CANDLE BURNING HEAT
Line_316	BURNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO SEE WAX MELTING
Line_317	SOUNDS LIKE SOME THINGS IS SIZZLE
Line_318	A HEAT IS EMITTING FROM THE WICK QUICK AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
Line_319	IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF HEAT AND MAKING LIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A BOOM OR SOME KIND OF NOISE THAT SHOWS ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THAT DRUM TO MAKE IT RELEASE A SOUND
Line_322	WELL THE PERSON'S BURNING CALORIES WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_323	WOOD GAS FOOD AND A CANDLE
Line_324	IT WILL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND EVEN WATER
Line_325	IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FROM
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I AM NOT SURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUTDOOR THING
Line_330	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MOST OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND RELEASE SMOG
Line_331	THEY POLLUTING THE EARTH WHILE SOLAR PANELS DO NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLOW
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHTBULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHTBULB IN A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT AS MUCH THERE'S IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	LIGHT WILL BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE POWER WITH THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D-CELL FACE THE SAME PROLETARIES
Line_344	FLIP THE D-CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOW OUT TWO WAYS IN THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEN FLOWS IN TWO WAYS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULB BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE THEN THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE ARE TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE OF THE
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT OF THERE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BURNS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TOO BECAUSE ONE OF THAT THE FILAMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT'S LIKE IN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILAMENT IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TOO
Line_368	A FILAMENT BREAKS AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE ELECTRICITY FLOW STOPS
Line_370	THE THE FILAMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUITS SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORKING BECAUSE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN EASILY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAS DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE AND IT STAYS ON
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNT WHICH IS LIKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_375	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED IN PATHWAYS
Line_376	WELL
Line_377	FILAMENT BROKE SO SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TOO IF IT'S A SERIES
Line_378	THIS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	WE'VE BEEN TOLD MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S EITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNET AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	OKAY SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DOES
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT'S STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	I THINK IT'S ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHEN TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS INTERACT
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPASS SHOWING YOU NORTH ON THE EARTH
Line_402	SOMEONE USING A COMPASS TO FIND IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT POSE THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTING METAL THAT IS DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRON
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPPOSITE POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERRING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OF IT DEMAGNETIZED EVERYTHING AS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISM TRANSFER BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BREAKING WITH A WAY
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE THIN STACK
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FORCE BECAUSE IT IS TOO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE ITS FARTHER AWAY
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKENS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAK
Line_427	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANCE
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACERS
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKES LESS WASHERS TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING OUT TO MAKE ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WRAP THE COIL WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
Line_433	WASHERS ARE AGAIN CAUGHT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAINAGE BECAUSE ELECTROMAGNET USES A TON OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE ENERGY IN THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	THE MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER
Line_438	IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
Line_439	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE COIL TO MAGNETIZE IT
Line_440	THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOW THROUGH THAT COIL TO MAGNETIZE THE RIVET
Line_441	IT'S TO BE MADE FROM THE STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	IT HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETIZE THE RIVET
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	THIS THESE ARE WIRES
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
Line_448	IT IS A SOURCE
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	THE WIRES ARE PATHWAY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
Line_455	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY LIGHT AND THEY USE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE BULB LIGHT
Line_458	IT HAS
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_461	IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUMP ON IT
Line_462	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES INTO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE THE FLOW GOES THE OTHER WAY
Line_466	THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOES
Line_467	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	I DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH IN THIS PICTURE IS UP AND
Line_479	THE THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON A CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I CLICK ON IT AGAIN
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_492	A SOLAR CELL DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANELS
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_498	THE NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR IT KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPERCLIP THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPSICLE STICK IS THERE AND IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CANNOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL NEED TO BE A METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DON'T WILL NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	OKAY
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSED I WOULD SAY IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD H OW ARE YOU
Line_512	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE CIRCUITS
Line_513	THINK THAT THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE THE WAX IS MELTING
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELTING
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELTING
Line_517	I SEE A FLAME
Line_518	IT'S IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	SOMEONE IS DRUMMING
Line_520	SHE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEAR IT
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE SHE HAS ENERGY TO WALK
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFF WILL MOVE
Line_525	AIR GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	OKAY
Line_528	THE SOLAR CELL THE
Line_529	STOP
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NON-RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THERE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTED
Line_532	THE COAL AND GAS POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_533	COAL AND GAS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_537	UM THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CLOSED
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN'T STOP
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCUIT
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULB
Line_541	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D-CELL AND THE LIGHTBULB
Line_542	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY IT'S HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERYWHERE DUN DUN
Line_544	ONE OF
Line_545	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WILL NEED MORE WIRES
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHTER TA TA TA TA
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT BRIGHTER
Line_548	NO THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_549	I SEE
Line_550	BUT HOW ARE YOU ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD
Line_551	I'M GOOD H OW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_553	THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	THERE ARE TWO
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER
Line_556	ALWAYS GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE BATTERY
Line_557	THAT IS WHY WE CALL DIRECT
Line_558	I NOTICED THAT IT GOES IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE YOU'RE THE MOST UGLIEST WOMAN
Line_559	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_560	I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT VERY QUICKLY
Line_562	NO OH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHTBULB AND THE ONE TWO LIGHTBULBS OH OH
Line_563	THEY ARE BRIGHTER
Line_564	BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO DIRECTLY AND IT ONLY GOES TO ONE LIGHTBULB
Line_565	THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I THINK THAT TOP
Line_567	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_568	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_570	THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS IN THERE
Line_571	THERE IS ONE BULB THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_572	EACH TYPE OF POSITIVE THERE ARE PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_573	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_574	THEY ARE ALL OR THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DIMMER
Line_576	I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTER
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE BRIGHTER YOU ARE THE DEAFEST WOMEN
Line_578	THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY ARE AWESOME
Line_579	THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOWING
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
Line_582	IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
Line_584	I DO NOT HERE SO PLEASE SAY IT AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO WHOLE PATHWAYS AND THEY ARE DONE
Line_586	THERE ARE TWO PATH WAYS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_587	IT LAST LONG
Line_588	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICKLY
Line_590	THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM ONES
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE PATHWAY
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D-CELL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES IN BOTH OF THEM
Line_594	I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT SO WE NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_596	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MY BEAUTIFUL LADY
Line_597	I FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND IT ATTRACTS THINGS OBVIOUSLY WITH NORTH AND SOUTH
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_600	THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
Line_601	THE NAIL THING IS STICKING ON TO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT IS MADE OF IRON MAYBE NOT
Line_603	WOOD YARN PLASTIC YEAH
Line_604	ATTRACTS TWO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOODBLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON AND STEEL IN IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOODBLOCK IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T ATTRACT
Line_607	THEY BOTH ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL RIGHT DON'T YOU THINK SO
Line_608	WITH THEY ARE BOTH MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL ITEMS
Line_610	I TOLD YOU IRON MAGNETS STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OF IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE IS STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL ONE THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I NOTICED THAT IS STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IS STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO MAGNET BECAUSE IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT MAY HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FINE HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COMPASSES WOWO
Line_623	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UH IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIDES AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT FOR WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY REPEL
Line_628	THE SAME SIDES ARE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE A NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPASS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND THE SOUTH SAME AND NORTH AND NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASE TELL
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRETTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY JUST STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THEY CANNOT GO THROUGH
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	I DON'T KNOW
Line_642	IT'S NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	BECAUSE IT ISN'T THE NAIL I MEAN IT ISN'T A MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THAT IT WILL STUFF
Line_646	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_647	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	I'VE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_650	THERE ISN'T ENOUGH POWER IN IT
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS A LOTS OF WAY ON THE B SIDE THE END MOVES APART
Line_652	THERE ARE WASHERS NO THEY ARE MAGNETS
Line_653	WASHERS GOING TO THE B CUP
Line_654	YOU CAN PUT SPACES
Line_655	IT MOVES THE MAGNET FOR IT'S A WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENS THE FORCE
Line_657	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_658	IT PUSH IT PUSHES AROUND
Line_659	PUT SPACER
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_662	IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_663	GOOD
Line_664	WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW RIVET CAN PICK UP WASHER
Line_665	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THERE ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WILL AH I DON'T KNOW
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
Line_670	IT DOESN'T HAVE THE
Line_671	IT'S I DON'T KNOW OKAY
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MAGNET
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU CAN PICK UP METALS
Line_674	THERE'S LOTS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	LOTS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
Line_676	ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVET MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_677	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL RING AND IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	JUST ROLL AROUND THE STEEL RIVET
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD TO YOU A BILLION TIMES
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPENED THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THAT IS CLOSED THEN OTHER WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN'T
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME ELECTRICITY TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_687	THEY HAVE TO RUN
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_690	THE HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
Line_691	THEN IT CAN BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEAT UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECTS CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU ARE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CAN THAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK
Line_697	WITHOUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO UH CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD UM NOT LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_698	THOUGHT IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY ELECTRICITY FROM THE THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHTBULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM WHAT YOU NEED ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND WHEN WERE AND
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WHERE IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHTEN IT UP
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVER REALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE BLUE BALLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BALLS OR BALLS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	IT THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE KNOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU ONE OF THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BASE OR ELSE IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NEW BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND UM WHAT THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE THE ENERGY FROM THE THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATTERY
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY OR ELSE THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW ALL THE WAY
Line_714	UM IT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WE LEARNED ABOUT YESTERDAY
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCH UM IT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY CAN WORK THE SUNS ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY THAT YOU CAN
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELLING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WHERE IT WOULD NOT TURN THE SUNS
Line_722	MAYBE IF IF IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET A
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREW
Line_727	ONE IS A SCREW IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO MAKE IT THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PAPERCLIP IS COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT
Line_729	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPERCLIP
Line_730	THE CRAFT STICK ISN'T MAKING A DIFFERENCE SO IT'S STILL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRAP STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALL OF IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL AND ITS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR OR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS BUT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT STILL GOT COMPLETING IT
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	FOR BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D-CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLELS CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT ITS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY WITH GOING TO THE DIFFERENT LIGHTBULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GETTING IT'S ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BETTER RIVET IT CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	COMES FROM COME FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO GOES INTO THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SIDE WAIT NO POSITIVE SIDE
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM THE D-CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB OUT OF ONE OF THEM BUT IT'S SECOND BULB ON THE OTHER
Line_751	THE LIGHTBULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEMSELVES THAT'S ALREADY BEEN USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND IT'S LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHTBULB'S HAD ALREADY HAD USED SOME OF THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS IN LIGHTING THEM UP
Line_754	HELLO GOOD
Line_755	AH THEY NORMALLY USE A CHRISTMAS TO DECORATE CHRISTMAS TREES AND HOUSES
Line_756	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRINGS BURNOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT IT'S
Line_758	A PARALLEL A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_759	CIRCUITS AND IF A BULB DOES HAVE TO HOLD LIKE AS A THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULB WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL IT COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE IT OUT THE ELECTRICITY THAT A NEED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IS AN EVEN
Line_766	THE OTHER BULB STAYS ON AND THAT ONES THE ANY ONE THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHERS BURN OUT
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEN GIVING IN A LINE AND TO IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST OF THEM STAY THERE
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS IN THE IN THE FILAMENT IN THE BULB WITH THE FILAMENT BROKEN
Line_769	FILAMENT IS BROKEN ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE ONE AT THE RIGHT IT'S FINE
Line_770	IT'S BOTH THE CIRCUIT WITH LIGHTING THE BULBS WITH THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR OTHER THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD YARN COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
Line_775	WELL THEY DON'T STICK MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEELS SCREWS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOODBLOCK ISN'T EVEN MOVING
Line_777	THE STEEL WELL THE IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THEIR
Line_778	IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCK HAS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND WOODBLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULLS IT TO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TIN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_783	IT WON'T STICK IT HAS IT TRACES LIKE IRON
Line_784	IF THE BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK DIDN'T I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE BLACK ROCK
Line_785	IT'S REAL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR STEEL PAPERCLIP
Line_786	THERE IS IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST REINFORCED
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD STOP ATTRACTING THEY WOULD REPEL
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PUSH IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WORK THROUGH THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OPPOSITES ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES REPEL
Line_791	FLOWING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE IS USING COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE IS GOING AND RIGHT NOW SHE IS GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE EARTH'S NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT STICKS THE MAGNETS AND WHAT HAPPEN WHEN THEY INTERACT
Line_795	THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECTS
Line_797	MAGNETISM ONLY TO A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BEYOND THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S IT'S TOO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE BIG STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING THE MAGNETISM THAT ATTRACTS THE PAPERCLIP
Line_800	UM SO IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW AND THEN IT ATTRACTS THE PAPERCLIP
Line_801	THEY ARE HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONES
Line_802	IT'S IT'S ATTRACTED TO
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHERE IT COMES OFF THE NAIL STOPS BEING A MAGNET
Line_804	YOU ARE WHEN YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF ITS STOPS SPINNING RIGHT THERE AND THE PAPERCLIP ALSO BECOMES A MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPERCLIP WITH ITS MAGNETISM
Line_807	TAKE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE ALL TIME
Line_809	IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRONSLASH STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND IT'S HOW STRONG THERE
Line_812	EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN'T ATTRACT THE MAGNET CAN'T ATTRACT THE PAPERCLIP TO SUCH THICK STACK
Line_814	SEEING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
Line_815	A MAGNET
Line_816	ADDITIONALLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISM BREAKS BECAUSE IT'S TOO STRONG IT HAVE A WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY ADDING ANOTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THAT THE MAGNETISM IS WEAKER QUICK THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SPACERS
Line_819	THEY'RE MUCH WEAKER THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE
Line_820	THE OF MAGNETISM
Line_821	MAGNETISM
Line_822	MAKES IT WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY
Line_823	FORCE
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DECREASES IT
Line_826	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC POLE WEAKER
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETIZE THE SCREWS SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT STARTS STICKING ELECTRIC ELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM DISAPPEARS
Line_831	THERE'S A D-CELL THE STEEL WASHERS A SWITCH IS A RIVET AND THE WIRES AND THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT BOARD
Line_832	IT MAKES STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
Line_833	ITS MAGNETIZING THAT THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LET'S THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE METAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND SO MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER IS THE MAGNETISM GETS
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE POWERING A MOTOR SO IT HAS TO BE FLOWN FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND THE IT'S LIKE AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW AND IT CAN'T BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED MAY BE A MAGNIFIED
Line_840	SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT MAGNITUDE UP TO THE RIVET
Line_842	AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURN IT ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY IN MAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AND STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THAT IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO RUN A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	IT MEANS
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THE CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING UM THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_864	SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THIS MOTOR
Line_865	THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN AND THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING CAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TOO MARNI SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	ENERGY WON'T THROUGH FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VOICE OKAY
Line_875	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_877	IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING BECAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKES
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE GO BOOM
Line_883	THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DELICIOUS
Line_884	THERE WILL BE SMOKE OR STEAM
Line_885	IT GETS FOGGY OR SMOKY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_889	I'M NOT SURE COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNIE I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_894	OUTSIDE AND THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_895	IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHTBULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHTBULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	ITS FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	ITS ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION OH MY GOSH DO NOT GET THE CONCEPT
Line_900	OH IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHTBULBS AND BACK INTO
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHTBULB
Line_902	IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT WHERE IT IS AND THE BASE AND THE CASING THAT IT'S THERE OKAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON
Line_905	THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE OF MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY WEIRD THAT THE BLACK ROCKS STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	IT IT DOES IS NOT STICK
Line_911	YES WHAT ELSE IT WOULD STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METAL
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING TO EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SCIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE REPELLING
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	IT'S NORTH TO SOUTH OR SOUTH TO NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH EXCEPT THE ONE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLD
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPASS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS PICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH THE PAPERS SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS IN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHER
Line_930	IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH TO THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY THIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY THICK THEN IT CAN'T
Line_932	THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	IT'S SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON THE PAPERCLIP
Line_934	THERE'S A PATHWAY
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPERCLIP
Line_936	IT TURNED IT INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANY MORE
Line_939	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHILE THE NAIL IS ON IT I MEAN ONLY WHILE THE MAGNET IS ON IT
Line_940	IT SHOWS WHAT IS TRANSFERRING IN TO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT'S
Line_945	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION IT'S TOO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WHAT WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROKE THE MAGNET
Line_947	THEY ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_949	THERE ARE SIX SPACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNET JUST STICK TOGETHER I'LL CLICK IT
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER BECAUSE THERE'S IS MORE SPACE IN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	IT MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEAKER
Line_952	YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER THE FORCE IN BETWEEN
Line_954	DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WERE WORKING AS A CIRCUIT
Line_956	I SEE CANDLE I THINK IT'S THE FIRE
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SURE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_958	AH IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	AND THE FIRE BRINGING IS PROOF THAT THE ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES LIKE IT'S STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRIDGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT A MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUT METAL LIKE THINGS NO IT'S MADE AS STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_964	REFRIGERATE DOES THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EITHER METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL LIKE IT'S STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON AND POSSIBLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD IN THIS STEEL NAIL WAS A IS
Line_967	THEY ARE BOTH MADE OF STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WHITE ONE IS IN MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	WELL THE METAL HAS STUFF LIKE STEEL OR LIKE AH IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PRI HAS LIKE METAL IN THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL ARE LIKE IRON IN INSIDE
Line_971	THE IRON OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	THE IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNIE
Line_974	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SPEAKER HE HAVE HUM CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTOR'S WORK AND HAVE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THE WIRE A BATTERY SPEAKER THE LIGHT
Line_976	WIRE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_977	THE WIRE IS LIKE THEY MAKE ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FROM ANOTHER
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE WIRE HMM
Line_980	IT PROVIDES AH UMM HAVE THE
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKE HUM
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTER
Line_983	IT WILL SHUT OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL HUM TURN
Line_984	WIRES THEY GET THE ELECTRICITY SO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_985	THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY HUM ELECTRICITY SHOW THE BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULB COULD LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS RECEIVED NO THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY FROM THE
Line_988	ITS FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THAT
Line_989	THE POINT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT AH UMM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_991	A FLIPPED OVER SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU FLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BACK
Line_994	THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE UM MOTOR THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SIDE IT WON'T TO THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BULB
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE BULB RIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BY THE D-CELL
Line_997	THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BACK TO THE MOTOR AND THE ON D-CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY DOES THAT BRING THE BATTERY BRINGS THE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR FROM THE ONE
Line_999	CAN YOU REPEAT IT
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PICTURE IS SO LIKE IT BURNT ON IT
Line_1001	THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLOSE OPEN
Line_1003	I NOTICED THAT UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSE THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON IT SPINS AND
Line_1004	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_1005	IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE UM THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR A BUT ONE I CLOSED IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T LEAVE OR IT DOESN'T MAKE THE ELECTRICITY ON FLOW TO THE MOTOR AM I CORRECT
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A GO GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLAR PANEL IS COLLECTING SUN LIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTORS SO THE MOTOR CAN RUN
Line_1009	WHAT BRING ELECTRICITY INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIN
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPINS THAT
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO COMPLETE MOTOR COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICED THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE METAL PART
Line_1013	ER I DON'T KNOW
Line_1014	UH HMM
Line_1015	I CAN TOLD YOU THAT THE INSULATORS OR OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT WORK
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARTS THAT WOULD MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	OKAY BYE MORNIE WHAT IS THAT YOUR NAME
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	WHO GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT HOW I'M FEELING
Line_1020	UM YOU JUST BE I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES D-CELL AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITVE SIDE
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND UM PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHARGING ELECTRONICS AND HOW LONG
Line_1026	I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE OR FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DOES I'M LIKE ANYTHING IT'S JUST WHAT SHH
Line_1029	I GET SEE THAT HEAT ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND THAT CALLED BE A
Line_1030	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_1031	I'M ACTUALLY DOING PRETTY GOOD
Line_1032	OH WE'VE BEEN DOING UM HAVE
Line_1033	UM IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOT ARE ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_1036	CAN YOU REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1037	THERE IS THREE FILAMENTS
Line_1038	THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
Line_1039	UM WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT NEGATIVE SIDE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL NOT FLOW BUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON HERE AGAIN THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL FLOW
Line_1040	ONE BATTERY ONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D-CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE SIDE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE HAVE A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUITS
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB UM WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT KNOW
Line_1047	IT
Line_1048	IT'S A IT'S JUST A USE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY ALL DONE
Line_1050	THEY SERVE YOU LIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL LIGHT
Line_1051	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY IN THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINUS SIGN
Line_1053	IT IS BLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWS IN THE PLUS SIGN AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN
Line_1055	MOLECULES ARE ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE LITTLE BULBS OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKAY HAVE SOME FUN
Line_1057	THE MINUS SIGN
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MORNIE
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T STARTED IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	EITHER WAY YOU QUICK ONE WIRE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MORNIE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1062	I WAS BUILDING A CIRCUIT STYLE
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND ENTER THE D-CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IS RUNNING AND THERE IS ON AND THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NOW RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WELL IT'S NOT NEXT TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT A ON THE METAL THAT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT'S THE METAL AND IT'S LIKE A ELECTRIC FIND TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	IT'S POPS
Line_1072	WHEN I QUICKED AT IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE FLAGS OUT ROLLING AND THERE IT'S AND THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS GOOD LITTLE HEXAGRAMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FROM THE SUN ARE A KIND OF LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PANEL AND THE WIRES
Line_1077	IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WILL SERVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT ON
Line_1080	IT JUST THE TROPHY DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES LEARN IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND TO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOTHING HAPPENING
Line_1084	YOU TOO MARNIE SEE YOU LATER HAVE A GOOD DAY TOO BYE
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
Line_1087	ELECTIRCITY UM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I THOUGHT THAT WILL WORK BUT
Line_1089	THEY ALL METAL
Line_1090	I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING A LOT JUST BEING WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THEY IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH ON THE WIRE
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK WHEN IF THEY MELT IT IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WONT WORK LIKE PLASTIC IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD RIGHT THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE WOOD IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	CONDUCTORS ARE A THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS AND
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICKED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY THE MOTOR STARTED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D-CELL THE SWITCH AND SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND GEE IT'S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGHT AND IT PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE A STICK THAT UM KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE UM THE PLASTIC AND IT'S SOUND ENERGY
Line_1110	SHE'S EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_1111	APPLES
Line_1112	THE FUEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE'LL BE HEAT ENERGY
Line_1114	IT THE FIRE MAKES THE AIR HOT AND SMOKE COMES FILLS THE AIR
Line_1115	THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1116	GAS WOOD WINDMILLS SOLAR PANELS
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BOTH SERVE ENERGY
Line_1118	THEY BOTH HAVE ENERGY AND UM AND THEY BOTH SERVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BOTH ARE FUEL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SERVE ENERGY THEY JUST GIVE OUT SMOKE AND THE GAS MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_1121	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1122	SOLAR PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GAS DOESN'T
Line_1123	THEY SERVE BAD SMELL AND PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THIS LIGHT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS IS LIGHTING UP
Line_1127	THEY'RE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILAMENTS IN THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW ANYWHERE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT'LL WORK LIKE A SWITCH ON THE CIRCUIT THAT WILL WORK
Line_1132	OH-IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY'LL GET DARKER
Line_1134	THEY ONE GETS BRIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN I CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLICKED IT AGAIN THEY STOPPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	OH I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF STUFF ON MAGNETS
Line_1140	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONCERNING ENERGY
Line_1143	UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FILAMENT
Line_1145	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE I MEAN THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON DIFFERENT SIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FOUR WIRES IN THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ALL AND INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRES
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
Line_1160	STRINGS A LIGHTS ORI DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1161	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DIE
Line_1163	WIRES IN A BATTERY END DO YOU LIGHT BULB
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH THE SWITCH IN THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE LEGO THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DYING
Line_1166	THE FILAMENT DIED
Line_1167	THE FILAMENT DIED ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	UH THE FILAMENT DIES IN THE WAY IN THE WAY
Line_1169	A FILAMENT DYING ON THE BATTERY
Line_1170	INCOMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CIRCUITS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE REST
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILAMENT ISN'T DYING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS
Line_1173	SO WE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINUS SIGN AND THEY WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AND THEN COMBINED CIRCUIT
Line_1175	WELL-THE FILAMENT IS DYING
Line_1176	UH BECAUSE IT'S STATS UP WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT'S
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT' S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IN THE UM LIGHT BULB IS IN THERE
Line_1178	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS IN CONDUCTS IN CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1180	I'VE BEEN DOING SOME UM NO MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN SEE COME THROUGH IN SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH SO THEY WERE NOT BE OPPOSITE SO THEY CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY ATTRACT THINGS ON THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	BECAUSE STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	ONE OF THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET IN THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THEN WOOD ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL AND A THAT'S IT
Line_1187	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD IS NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND ALUMINUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL FIT WILL FIT IN AND STICK
Line_1194	YES THEY HAVE LOT OF TIPS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE I HAVE
Line_1196	NO MAGNET IS ATTRACT EACH OTHER PAPERCLIP
Line_1197	TOMBSTONE
Line_1198	THESE ARE ER MAGNET THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNET THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY IN THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WHEN ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT ALL STOPS AND IT ALSO FALL UNDER THE FALL
Line_1205	NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BUILT UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED TO HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES I NEED TO MAKE A
Line_1208	I NEED UH WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETS THREE WIRES IN A BATTERY
Line_1209	UH
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S A NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIE
Line_1211	UH HMM I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVETS STOPS FLOWING ENERGY END AND THEN THE CIRCUITS STOPPED GENERATE MAGNETS FLOW
Line_1212	SILENCE
Line_1213	OPEN AND THEN CLOSED
Line_1214	ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING AT THE MAGNETS BUT THE RIVET
Line_1215	ELECTRICITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	RIVET AND NAILS AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY IN THE BATTERY IN THAT MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN LIGHT BULB ON
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDING THE POWER INTO THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT TURN ON
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOK TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1225	THE WIRES CREATE THE ELECTRICITY CITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1226	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY IT DOES WHAT'S RECEIVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MAY ELSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL TOWARDS CONNECT THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE DOT THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF IT
Line_1231	I WAS ABSENT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I NOTICED THAT WHEN Y CLIP IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PANEL AND HOW WOULD THE SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING BATTERY ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR A MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICED THAT ALL THE PIECE WILL ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WON'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	INSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT THE THING IS LIKE THE PLASTIC AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS HAVE A INSULATORS DON'T WORKED AS CONDUCTOR
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1239	THE CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE WORK AND WITHOUT THE ENERGY IS NOTHING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE WAS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS THE
Line_1242	YEAH BUT GLOW CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TYPE WAS SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BURNING
Line_1245	UH HMM WHEN YOU PUTTING THE HANDS PART ON THE ZONE IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING AND WHEN SHE WOULD EAT SHE IS S GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOOD SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALK
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEAR NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRL WAS EATING THEN ITS GIVING THAT ENERGY SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
Line_1249	I WON'T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_1250	IT POLLUTES THE AIR THE AIR GETS ON DIRTY AND NOT GOOD TO YOU FOR TO BREATHE IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT THEY COMES OFF SMOKY
Line_1252	THERE ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY STORING
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COAL SIMILAR BECAUSE IT HAVE BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND GAS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE BURN THEM
Line_1255	COAL AND GAS THAT HAVE EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BREATH
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	THE ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FOR THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1262	THE BLUE DOTS MOVING REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCULATING
Line_1263	THERE IS ONE OR THERE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY IN A SERIES
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH
Line_1265	BYE MARNIE
Line_1266	VERY WELL HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE THAT
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE'S TWICE A MUCH OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D-CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOW GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
Line_1274	THE END IN A BATTERY WERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES YOU JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COME FROM THE SIDE OF THE SECOND OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB AND GOES INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_1276	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING EVEN MY OTHER ONE WHICH IS USING TO
Line_1277	HOW YOU UM HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BULB YEAH IT'S TWO WIRES YOU KNOW AND A BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOURCE IS THE SAME THING
Line_1281	WELL IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1282	ENERGY
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHITE PIECES
Line_1284	WILL THEY LIGHT UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THERE IS A WIRE THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT BULB HERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE CLEAN DOWN END
Line_1286	CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
Line_1287	UM IT IS GOING TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_1288	I KNOWS THAT THEY ARE GOING JUST LIKE THE SAME ONE
Line_1289	BUT THEY ARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1290	YOU IS FIRST WHY AND THEN TURNS TO ALLOW SO IT TURNS
Line_1291	OKAY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1292	WE HAVE BEEN I'M DOING LIKE IT MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GONE
Line_1293	WELL THAT UM CRAZY IS AND THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1294	IT IS IN CLOSED BECAUSE THE MOTOR THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE A ROUND IN A
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1300	THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1301	THE FLAG STARTS MOVING AROUND AN AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO CLICK THE WIRE AND IT WILL START THE FIRE WILL START
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH HITS THE WIRE THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1304	IT'S STARTS MOVING THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
Line_1306	THE GREAT PIECE WHEN IT SUNNY
Line_1307	WELL KIND OF CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS LIGHT WHEN YOU CLOSE TO THE SUN
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVING
Line_1310	WHEN THERE IS WALKING THE FLAG STOPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN HM
Line_1312	I SEE THE FLAG MOVING
Line_1313	THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THAT'S MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	FIRST THEM ALL WIRES AND THE SWITCH
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSED
Line_1318	IS NOT MOVING THROUGH THE STICK
Line_1319	IT IS USELESS STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	I DON'T ANYMORE CLOSE TO ANYMORE LEARNING IT
Line_1321	OKAY SO THE PLASTIC
Line_1322	THE STEEL MAGNET THE STEEL
Line_1323	YOU TOO BYE MONNY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUIT
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE AND THE FLAG IS MOVING THAT WAY
Line_1326	I JUST SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AROUND
Line_1327	THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT HAS SOME METAL
Line_1329	IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1330	MM
Line_1331	DON'T RUNNING FINE
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANAL IN FIRE ON IT IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STATE AS TRAFFIC IS GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GETTING ENOUGH TO GET
Line_1334	BECAUSE I REALLY BE WANTED TO BREATH
Line_1335	IT MELTS BECAUSE OF THE FIRE AND LIVE IN THE IT MELTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT WE CAN IT'S FIRERY
Line_1337	NO I COULDN'T SEE NOTHING
Line_1338	IT WAS A SOUND BLEEDER DO IT FROM DRY IT WAS FIRERY
Line_1339	IT IS SAVE OF ENERGY OF THE YEAH
Line_1340	IT SOUNDS SO THAT OF THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	HM
Line_1342	I AM SEE BLADE GAS BUBBLE AND A FLIER
Line_1343	YOU KNOW A WIRE ABLE WOULD RELAX UP AND GO
Line_1344	IT GOES ON AND ON
Line_1345	THE SOLAR PANEL IS THE ENERGY
Line_1346	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1347	THIS CIRCUIT IS
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETISM
Line_1349	THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IT STRAIGHT ONE IS CURT AND ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	THEY CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON AND
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIGE-REFRIGERATOR
Line_1352	IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNET AND SO THE REFRIGERATOR IS
Line_1354	WELL THE THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTING TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_1355	THEY ARE STICKY BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING AH THE SCREW
Line_1357	WELL A TRASH CAN IT DOES BUT A GATE DOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE AH IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1359	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1360	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1364	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN'T
Line_1365	IRON
Line_1366	IT
Line_1367	ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1369	YEAH BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WASTE THE ENERGY
Line_1371	UH THE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D-CELL THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO ITS NORMAL SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSHED
Line_1374	I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EACH ENDS
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY
Line_1381	ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT
Line_1382	INSULATORS ARE HELPFUL
Line_1383	ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY
Line_1384	SO
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT IT'S MELTING
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WENT THE WAX MELTED AND DROPPED I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
Line_1390	IT'S HEATING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING OFF
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUR YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE GETTING IT ALL FOCUSED ON THE SOUND AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HER FEET
Line_1393	UM SHE'S GETTING THE ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE'S EATING
Line_1394	THE AN APPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PAN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA WORK BECAUSE GAS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	BECAUSE UM THE COAL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE GAS HASN'T I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T SMELL THE EARTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREES AND EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	WORTH THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NONRENEWABLE
Line_1400	HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
Line_1401	WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK
Line_1404	AM I THINK THE WORK MAY BE
Line_1405	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1406	BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THAT THE ENERGY FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THIS THREE WIRES THERE IS A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN THERE
Line_1411	MAY IT DOESN'T WORK OR REALLY THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK
Line_1412	AA<SIDE
Line_1413	THAT ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1414	TO THAT CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE THAT I HAD RECEIVED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT AA
Line_1416	THERE IS A SWITCH FOR A NEW ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT THE BATTERY
Line_1418	BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING AND I AM
Line_1419	BULB STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WITH THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLD THAT ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	WOULD YOU SPEAK A LIGHT IS PARTY
Line_1421	THESE WIRES HOLD LIKE ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1422	IT WILL WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE UM THAT STRATEGIES HOLD BACK
Line_1423	THE ETHYLENE WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALREADY DRIED OUT AND START
Line_1424	I WILL NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1426	NO BODY AND CAN I PUT TO USE JUST WITH WHAT IS
Line_1427	LIGHT BULB BROKE AND IT DOESN'T
Line_1428	LIGHT BULB GROW SO IT DOESN'T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT ANOTHER
Line_1429	WE HAD SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1430	WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STANDARD IS DOESN'T WORK
Line_1431	THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THREE WIRES
Line_1432	AA WE REALLY IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL WHAT ARE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE
Line_1433	BROKEN THEY DOESN'T LIGHT ANYONE
Line_1434	WELL UM WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERY
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A COUPLE OF WIRES
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO USE
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT OVER WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVE SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GO THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS AND THERE IS A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP THE POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING
Line_1440	UM POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF A FLASH LIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND
Line_1442	IT RECEIVES POWER AND FROM THE UM WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND NORMAL
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
Line_1445	UM WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME ENOUGH I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S JUST I DIDN'T KNOW THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN'T SEE PICTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	UM THE BAD THE D-CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THAT ENERGY SOURCES GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING HIS POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCES GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1453	I MEAN SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT GIVES SOME THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	UM THE PERSON HE DID IT PUT ANOTHER PLACE AND SO NOW THROUGH
Line_1458	IT'S GIVES A IT GIVES THAT POWER SOURCE POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK I MEAN THE SWITCHES TO BE DOWN FOR THE
Line_1460	METAL HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
Line_1461	THINK WHENEVER I CLICK IT UM IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
Line_1462	SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHT WAY
Line_1463	UM WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT SOME YEAR BECAUSE THE POWER THAT WE GOT DELAYED BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUN LIGHT IS HELPING THAT THAT LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS TO
Line_1466	I'M TRYING TO MAKE CIRCUIT IN DIFFERENT ACHIEVING
Line_1467	SWITCHING THE ELEMENT
Line_1468	UM ALUMINUM NAIL SWITCH THE METAL IN THE MOTOR
Line_1469	A SWITCH THE METAL IN THE D-CELL
Line_1470	UM IT SEARCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METAL
Line_1471	UM THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE IT COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	AND THERE IS NOTHING REALLY ELSE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST
Line_1473	UM IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOW
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS A LOT BETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF OF IT
Line_1477	UM THE FLAME GLARES OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS LIKE IT
Line_1478	IT BURNS AND THE WAX IT MELTS
Line_1479	UH IT SOUNDED KINDA LIKE POPPING A LITTLE BIT CAUSE IS A BIG FLAME
Line_1480	SOMEBODY'S HITTING THE BONGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENERGY
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRYING AND THAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DESK A A FAN TREE BRANCHES RAISINS AND FUEL
Line_1483	IT GIVE OUT MORE AIR BECAUSE OF THE THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE THE FIRE UM POLLUTES AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT EFFECTS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S GONE AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HIEE
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING ON THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A
Line_1490	YEAH HOPE SUCH HUGE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WOULDN'T SHOW
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO CORRECTLY COULD SHOCK YOU OR UM IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	ON THE FRONT OF THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINUS
Line_1494	CLOSER THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF YOU GET STUCK OR
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D-CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER ALONG WITH D-CELLS THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT
Line_1497	YOU KNOW THAT REALLY LIGHT AND WEIGHT
Line_1498	THE ONE D-CELL MAYBE DIMMER BUT D-CELLS ONCE BATTERIES ARE RARE EQUAL
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D-CELL IT MOVES IT IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIOUS CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHER
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE ON BOTH THINGS SO MAKES BRIGHT
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERIES SERIES CIRCUIT ARE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE MAGNET IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT AND IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT WATCH THE BULB BUT I THINK THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1508	BECAUSE RUNS AT FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER ONE THE FILMAMENT BREAKS IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYONE
Line_1509	AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREAK
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB STOPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE UM BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STAGE ON
Line_1513	THERE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1514	NOTHING HAPPEN BECAUSE ITS NOT CONNECTED TO A
Line_1515	BECAUSE IT'S JUST TO IN ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CIRCUITS WORKING FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
Line_1516	TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER BY YOU TRYING TO POWER UP
Line_1517	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D-CELL GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWERED UP IN BACK THROUGH THE WHERE END OF D
Line_1518	THE ENERGY TO GO DIRECTLY TO LIGHT BULB AND BACK MAKE A LIGHT
Line_1519	THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND TOWARDS THE BATTERY BACK TO NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1520	THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS IN THE SERIES AND INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER UP BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1522	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BE THAT AH THAT DIM
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT
Line_1528	THAT THE D-CELLS DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY
Line_1529	BYE
Line_1530	THEY ARE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH HENCE EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THE THAT SHAPE LIKE A
Line_1531	WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH GO ON TO EACH OTHER THEY CONNECT BUT IF NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH TRY TO CONNECT IT WILL WORK
Line_1532	IT'S ALL ONE BIG SIDE
Line_1533	THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THERE ALL ON ON THEIR END
Line_1534	A STEEL OF STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DOOR NUT BRING MAGNET
Line_1535	BECAUSE THAT NAIL IS MAGNETIC
Line_1536	WOOD IRON AND COPPER
Line_1537	THE ONES THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET IT STICK TO IT THAT ONE SIDE DON'T IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT STICK TO IT WILL
Line_1538	SO WHITE NAIL IS A MAGNETIC A MAGNETIC FORCE SO ITS NOT STICKING TO IT
Line_1539	FOR ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A MAGNET THAT IS A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
Line_1540	IT HAS TO BE EITHER METAL OR IRON
Line_1541	IT'S MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED IN STEEL
Line_1542	I THINK IT HAS SOME KIND ORE IN IT
Line_1543	ORE AND IRON
Line_1544	THAT THERE IS ONLY
Line_1545	THAT THEY ARE BOTH LIGHT IT
Line_1546	THAT THAT LIGHT BULBS OR MORE BRIGHT THEN THE ONES ON THE THE ONE ON THE
Line_1547	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT MORE WHATEVER YOU ARE TRYING TO I DON'T
Line_1548	THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE IT WONT LIGHT
Line_1549	THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THAT POWERS THE MORE OF IT GOING BACK TO THE D
Line_1550	THAT THEY ARE POWERING UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1551	THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_1552	TO
Line_1553	THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS KEEPS IT BURNING OUT
Line_1554	THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE D-CELL
Line_1555	THAT THEY ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_1556	THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THERE IS
Line_1557	THAT BATTERIES NOT LIGHTING AND
Line_1558	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A CIRCUIT
Line_1559	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
Line_1560	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONE
Line_1561	THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1562	THAT THE BULBS ARE BURNING OUT
Line_1563	THAT THE SWITCHES NOT TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THAT LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1564	THAT THE FILAMENT BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT
Line_1565	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1566	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1567	THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINUE
Line_1568	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1569	THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THEN IT WON'T BURN OUT QUICKLY
Line_1570	THAT WHEN ONE FILAMENT BREAKS UH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL STILL KEEP CONTINUING
Line_1571	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY OH
Line_1572	THAT THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
Line_1573	IT BREAKS IT BREAKS A LIGHT BULB
Line_1574	AFTER THE UM FILAMENT BREAKS
Line_1575	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
Line_1576	ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
Line_1577	THAT THERE ARE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE A NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
Line_1578	THAT THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE WILL BREAK THEM APART
Line_1579	THAT THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FORCE BRINGS THEM TOGETHER
Line_1580	THAT UM THE THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
Line_1581	BECAUSE IT IS METAL AND IT'S STICKING TO A INSIDE OF THE MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THE NAIL
Line_1582	THAT IT IS METAL
Line_1583	WOOD GRASS DIRT
Line_1584	THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1585	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1586	BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT A METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT THE MAGNET'S STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER OR OTHER ONE THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE IS STEEL OR ONE IS STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I DID
Line_1591	THAT IT STICKED
Line_1592	STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN UH STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1593	THAT IT WOULDN'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER CANNOT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1594	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1595	STEEL OR METAL OR IRON
Line_1596	THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT CAN STICK AND NOT STICK ON TO THEM AND THE NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
Line_1597	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1598	THEY HAVE OTHER METAL IN THEM WHICH MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT TO
Line_1599	THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL IN
Line_1600	THAT THERE ARE MAGNETIC COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1601	THAT THE MAGNET UM MAGNET UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_1602	THAT UM ONE STACK IS BIGGER THAN ANOTHER SO THE MAGNET ONE OR ANOTHER
Line_1603	HI CARL
Line_1604	THAT THE MAGNET CANNOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET THROUGH THAT THICK OF PAPER
Line_1605	THAT THE MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_1606	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THAT UNTIL THE MAGNET GETS TAKEN OFF UH THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKEN OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO THE TOUCH THE UH METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FIXED STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP ISN'T
Line_1611	WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	NOW WHEN IT GETS TO WASHERS THEN MAGNETISM BREAKS
Line_1613	THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	THE SPACERS ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO SAY THAT
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETITE FORCE IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IS
Line_1619	TO HAVE NINE SPACERS BRING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO UH WRAP IT ROUND THE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1622	THAT THERE ARE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THE RIBBON AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE A WILL STICK TO THE RIBBON
Line_1623	SO PRODUCES A ELECTRICITY
Line_1624	A CLOSEDCIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT CARRIES IS LIKE A MAGNETISM FORCE SO THAT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METAL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT OF THE ELECTROMAGNET ALL CAN CARRY
Line_1627	THAT THE ELECTRIC-ELECTROMAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IS NOT ELECTROMAGNET ANY MORE
Line_1629	THAT IS THIS ELECTROMAGNET IT UP AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE
Line_1630	IT IS CLOSED
Line_1631	IT'S STARTS THE PICKUP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1633	THE RIVET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	THAT'S SO BE WRAPPED AROUND THIS WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ALSO THE RIVET CAN BE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW DO USED STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP THEY HELP LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP NO LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TO USE
Line_1639	I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE I'M IT'S A SOURCE TO LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_1640	I THINK WHAT TRAVELS IN WIRES IS ENERGY TOOK TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	WHITE BULBS ARE TURNED LIGHT OVER ROOM OR ANYTHING THAT NEEDS LIGHT IN DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	I THINK THAT MEANS HM WAIT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN BUT THAT'S REALLY OH I GET THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND
Line_1645	IT BECAUSE THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS SO LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLUS
Line_1646	I THINK THE BLUE DOT REPRESENT THE ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE MINUS SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONENT NEEDS HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK AMONG THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK AMONG THE BOTTOM THEY WOULD NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BYE MARNIE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE GREAT HOPE
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D-CELL INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES IT
Line_1652	ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THAT FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D-CELL BATTERY AND MAY CREATES THE ENERGY TO MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGING JUST LIKE A
Line_1655	WHENEVER SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICED THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D-CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKES THE FLAG TO MOVE THE CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE I'M SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	SUN IS GIVING THE SOLAR ENERGY AND IT'S FLOWS TO THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1660	I THINK IS IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WASTE ENERGY AND NO IT DOESN'T WASTE
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WHEN IT CREATES ENERGY TO MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOESN'T NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE
Line_1664	AND THE D-CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS TO THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKES THIS FLAG
Line_1665	YOU TO MARNIE THANK YOU BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HM CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS BEEN AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE THE DIFFERENCE STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1668	THE NAILS IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKES THE FLAGS SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D-CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAIL
Line_1670	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKES THE FLAGS SPIN BUT OTHER THIGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN'T
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIPS IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL AT WORK RIGHT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL SO IT WILL NOT
Line_1674	OPEN I THINK OPEN MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MAY BE
Line_1677	CLOSED MAY BE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS OR ANYTHING METAL THAT CAN CREATE CREATE IS SPARK OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
Line_1679	I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BYE MARNIE HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME
Line_1681	GOOD GOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1683	I HAVE BEEN DOING I FORGOT BECAUSE
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT UM CIRCUITS WILL BE
Line_1685	I FORGOT SORRY
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY AND THEN LIKE THE ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY IS LIKE GOES TO EVERYTHING AND MAY BE INTO EVERYTHING I GET
Line_1688	THIS FOLLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WE
Line_1689	UM THE BLUE DOTS OR D AH ELECTRICITY MAY BE
Line_1690	THEY COULD NOT TO ME ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS REMINDED ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	UP TO FRESH IN IS THAT THE GOES UP TO THE D CELL AND GOES A BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THE METAL INTO LIGHT BULB
Line_1693	I THINK THERE'RE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULD MORE ENERGY AND THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT BRIGHT
Line_1695	MORE MOBES MEANS LESS LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILL GET DOT CODE AND THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD
Line_1697	I THINK THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIKE BRIGHTER
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WOULD ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT ONE MORE TWO D CELLS IS VERY VERY BRIGHT
Line_1699	D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL
Line_1700	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GUESS
Line_1702	I DO ALSO WITH TOUCH I I WILL MISS USE
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK IT IS A I AM NOT ACTUALLY I AM NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE'S ENERGY BECAUSE THERE'RE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRES THINGS BATTERY LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	I REALLY DON'T KNOW
Line_1707	I THINK THAT THE BATTERY I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB WILL DIM
Line_1708	I NOTICEDTHAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE PATH WAYS MAY BE
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK IT IF IT HAS ITS OWN ITS OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	I REMEMBER THAT AH A CLOSED THAT IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1713	I THINK IT IS FALLING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACKING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1714	I NOTICED THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE'VE TWO
Line_1716	I'M I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1717	I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS NO WIRES
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THIS CIRCUIT BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THERE'RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT UM ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	OH I SPEAK THAT THEY TOP ONE WOULD
Line_1721	I THINK THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WILL BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT SO VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S THEY ARE BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I AM LEARNING ABOUT
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT UM THE CIRCUIT IS NOT THE ON THE METAL SIDE SO IT THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
Line_1726	BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT DEPENDENT
Line_1727	UM I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOKED WILL NOT LIKE LIGHTING NEW MORE
Line_1728	I DON'T KNOW I
Line_1729	THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO WITH DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB CAN'T DOESN'T LIGHT LIKE AND I CUTTING THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPEN WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THE THE LIGHT BULB THAT DOESN'T WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING OF WORK
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULB THAT MAY BE
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHEN EVER FILAMENT BREAKS BOTH THESE ARE LIGHT BULB TURN ON JUST BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB AND HELPS TO OTHER LIGHT BULB WIRE
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE ISNT LIGHTING BECAUSE IS THE ONE IS BROKE
Line_1734	ONE AH LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT BECAUSE OF THE FILAMENT BROKE SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOPS
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT HAPPEN WHEN BULB BREAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOWS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	PARALLEL NAIL
Line_1738	WHATEVER ONE BREAKS THE OTHER ONE IS THE LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWNED WIRES
Line_1739	I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILAMENT BREAKS BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB AH ONE IS THE ENERGY COMPLETELY STOPS
Line_1741	I'M NOTICED THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER ONES
Line_1742	THIS PICTURE HAS TO DO WITH THE BULB BURNING UP BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES SENSE
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE ARE WIRES AND THE SWITCHES ON CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH SO THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_1744	I THINK SOME FORM ISN'T LET OUT BECAUSE UM THE SWITCH IS ON
Line_1745	WHENEVER ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BURNS OUT
Line_1746	HEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER UM ONE BULB BURNTS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WERE NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	WHENEVER THE FILAMENT BREAKS THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
Line_1752	UM THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTS
Line_1753	UM I THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN LIGHT AND OWN WIRE
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN WIRE OH UM SO WHENEVER ONE FILAMENT BREAKS THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHT
Line_1756	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS UM THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK REALLY IT'S THE LAST ONE I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT IS BREAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNTS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
Line_1760	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THEIR CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	I KNOW THAT
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UM I KNOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB IS IN THAT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	I THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	UM MORE EVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANYTHING WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRIDGES EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IF ORDERED FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY HAD MADE THAT OF UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	THEY HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TYPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNETS
Line_1775	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THIS STEEL ONE WAS STICK BECAUSE IT HAS EITHER STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET OR EITHER MADE OUT OF UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIPS STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERY WIRE AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MAKE THE WIRE
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILL LIGHT UP THE BULB
Line_1787	THAT I REVISED LIKE
Line_1788	IT'S LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT
Line_1789	YOU'RE
Line_1790	IT FLOWS BY IT HAS MUCH ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE LEFT TO MAKE A LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND MAKE GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN AND TO THE
Line_1794	ITS MOVING TO THE MINUS WAY
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINUS
Line_1797	ITS GIVING A LOT OF ENERGY
Line_1798	TO SEE
Line_1799	IT DOEN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	IT GIVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING POWER
Line_1802	ITS
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOP
Line_1808	ITS GOING AROUND THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE
Line_1809	BURNING IT WAS
Line_1810	THE MOTORS MOVING
Line_1811	SPINNING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT SPIN
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SPONGE ON IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1814	THESE ARE MOTOR
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY
Line_1816	IT NOT ON SPIN
Line_1817	IT'S NON-METAL GIVE THE ENERGY
Line_1818	IS A INSULATOR BECAUSE ITS NON-METAL
Line_1819	THE SPONGE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT MELT
Line_1820	ARE DIFFERENT SOME ONE METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S METAL SOME ARE THE
Line_1822	IT WON'T METAL ON TO IT WANT TO GOES THROUGH
Line_1823	IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1824	IF WHAT HAPPEN THEY WON'T SPIN
Line_1825	THEY WILL NOT TO CONNECT TO METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE THEY MAKING THEM TO SPIN BECAUSE I HAD METAL
Line_1827	GOOD
Line_1828	IT THE CANDLE LIGHT UP
Line_1829	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU
Line_1830	CANDLE AND IT RELEASED SCIENCE BECAUSE
Line_1831	ITS MELTING
Line_1832	BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY
Line_1833	HIGH
Line_1834	THEY WENT
Line_1835	THE GERMS
Line_1836	SHE IS EATING THE FOOD
Line_1837	ITS GIVING
Line_1838	ITS GIVING
Line_1839	THE GIRL IS GIVE ENERGY AND HER BODY
Line_1840	LIGHTING
Line_1841	HER BODY IS
Line_1842	YOU SEE THE CANDLE SOME
Line_1843	UPWARD
Line_1844	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY
Line_1845	IT GET IT GIVE HEAT
Line_1846	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1847	SUN IS GIVING THE ENERGY
Line_1848	UM OH
Line_1849	DO YOU WISH TO
Line_1850	BECAUSE GAS WILL GET THE COAL ENERGY
Line_1851	BECAUSE ONE HAS NON DREAM ONE DOESN'T
Line_1852	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1853	YOU WILL NOT KNOW
Line_1854	HEAT ENERGY
Line_1855	I DON'T KNOW HOW IS THAT ABSOLUTE
Line_1856	WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A MAGNET
Line_1857	TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULB LATER
Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELL GIVES THE ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING A PATH WAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL
Line_1862	THE DOCS
Line_1863	ITS BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THE ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THE ENERGIES TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1865	NOW ENERGY
Line_1866	MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERGY
Line_1867	WE NEED WE NEED AN ANOTHER D CELL IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
Line_1868	THE D CELL THE LIGHT BULBS THAT MAKES LIGHTER SO
Line_1869	ONE D CELL ONE LIGHT BULB HAS ITS
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY WILL GO PASS WILL PASS THROUGH
Line_1872	THE D CELL STICK TOGETHER
Line_1873	GOOD
Line_1874	MAGNETISM
Line_1875	BRINGS OUT THAT NOISE GO TOGETHER IT WILL
Line_1876	ITS REPELLING
Line_1877	ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SAME
Line_1878	BECAUSE SOMETHING THEY ARE DIFFERENT
Line_1879	MAGNETISM
Line_1880	THEY
Line_1881	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING AND REPELLING
Line_1882	ITS ITS GOING
Line_1883	ITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND IS WHEN IT IS OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1884	THEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT OUT I MEAN WHEN YOU TO AROUND
Line_1885	IT WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1886	IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN
Line_1887	THERE IT WILL ITS BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL WHEN IT BROKE IT WILL
Line_1889	IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT BEEN ON TO ONE PROBABLY
Line_1890	ONCE LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHTER
Line_1891	ITS WHENEVER NORTH NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WILL START THAT
Line_1893	ITS ENERGY FORCE
Line_1894	ITS UM WHEN ITS RAN
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT HM LIKE CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL START
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL START
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WILL STOP ON THIS
Line_1899	BECAUSE ITS ENERGY
Line_1900	NOTHING HAPPENING
Line_1901	ITS BECAUSE ITS
Line_1902	BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB RUN OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND REPELLING
Line_1904	WHEN YOU DO NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY GO PROTECT WHEN YOU DO SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL FORWARD
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON SIDE AND THE OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	IT'S BEEN USED CONNECTED TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO
Line_1909	IT'S BECAUSE THAT HAS IRON INSIDE OF ITS SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK THEY WON'T ATTRACTS BECAUSE AS IRON INSIDE OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT TO HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
Line_1913	EITHER HAS IRON AND MAGNET DOES ABLE TO ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS
Line_1915	MAGNETS STICK TO IRON
Line_1916	IS BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOES HAVE IRON
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN'T HAVE
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON AND THAT
Line_1919	THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS TO
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NO METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACT IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	I THINK
Line_1927	THAT AN IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT
Line_1929	THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT
Line_1930	BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO
Line_1931	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE
Line_1934	SIDE IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1935	NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE
Line_1936	IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1937	THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE
Line_1942	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT
Line_1943	THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1945	THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1949	IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF
Line_1953	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1954	THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK
Line_1956	IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
Line_1957	WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING
Line_1958	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	IT MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1963	THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1964	THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT
Line_1969	IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP
Line_1970	ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES
Line_1972	ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE
Line_1974	NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1976	THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA-ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER
Line_1977	AND FINNALY MET BEFORE
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY
Line_1981	YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
Line_1983	YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_1985	ONE HM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK
Line_1988	METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT HUM CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING
Line_1991	BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL IN LITTLE THEY'RE ALL IN LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TYPE WRITER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART PHONE
Line_1997	SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIX
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS IN YOUR FOOD
Line_1999	ALL OF THE FOOD DIFFERENT FOOD MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BOWL BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP ON THE FILTER
Line_2001	WATER IS FILTERING
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAYED IN THE COFFEE FILTER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILTERING
Line_2004	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALT WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU MIX SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIFE JUST DIED AGAIN
Line_2010	SOIL PROJECTS
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE AREA
Line_2013	THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL
Line_2014	THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN IT
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2017	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAIN AND FARM LANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARBON
Line_2019	DELTA HAS SOME VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2020	THERE IS A LOT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL IN THAT THEN CAUSE IT HAS SILT CLAY HUMMUS GRAVEL AND THAT STUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN THIS SOIL
Line_2023	ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICK
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PLANT LIFE LIKE CACTI AND CACTI AND BUSHES AND MORE CACTI
Line_2025	DELTA HAS A LOT MORE SAND THAN DESERT
Line_2026	GOOD BYE
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLOOD
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN AND YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT AS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	IT'S PLAYING ONE OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISSOLVED IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEING IT'S MULTIPLY IT'S BEING
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_2035	YES
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FORGOT THE WORD
Line_2041	CAUSE THE WATER'S LIKE FLOATING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS LIKE STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLUTE
Line_2044	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPEARS
Line_2045	TIME LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLVENT
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THAT THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE A SOLUTION OR
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER WILL
Line_2053	THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WAIT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOUR MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTION
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFEE FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE SOME
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THE SKY OR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPORATE
Line_2065	CAN WE PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMATE OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTIONS
Line_2068	SPOONS ARE FLOATING
Line_2069	A
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIGHER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEETER OR BITTER
Line_2072	THEY'RE GONNA BE UM HARDER SWEETER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEETER AND THEY LOOK DENSER
Line_2074	THEY'RE DILUTED
Line_2075	LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU GET WATER OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD EITHER TAKE OUT UM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT UM MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY TAKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	BLAH BLAH BLAH OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES AT TASTER AND ONES UH OBSERVED
Line_2083	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON A SCALE
Line_2084	ONE IS TEN TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THERE ALL OF EM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	UM SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	SOLUTION ONE AND SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENSITY HAS IS THE CORK IS LIGHTER THAN THE PENNY AND SO IT FLOATS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLOAT
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS
Line_2096	BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD FLOAT
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THEN WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIX
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A IN FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED AND GOT THAT
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THAN THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BYE BYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	WE THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE IS SUGAR AND ONE IS CITRIC ACID
Line_2109	BECAUSE IT
Line_2110	I DON'T CARE
Line_2111	SAME CHART IN OUR SCIENCE NOTEBOOKS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE I SAID
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SPIKE
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT'S SALT
Line_2117	IT'S SPIKY
Line_2118	SAY THAT AGAIN SAY WHAT WHAT WHAT
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SAID THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NOW
Line_2122	WE'VE BEEN DOING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANTS AND THEY REACT OFF OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE'S CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTE
Line_2126	NO BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	H TWO O
Line_2128	THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM I'D NOTHING'S WRONG WITH THEM
Line_2130	BAKING SODIUM CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND H TWO O
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT'S A PRECIPITATE
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING JUST ICE GETTING PUT IN A GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWEATING
Line_2135	THE WATER'S CHANGING COLORS
Line_2136	IT'S PRETTY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS BUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIZZED AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TURNING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE GREEN
Line_2141	YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS UM SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECOND HAS NONE AT ALL
Line_2143	IF A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIZZ OR IF IT TURNED HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	UM CALCIUM CHLORIDE WATER AND UM SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THAT WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY EITHER BLEW UP THE BAG AND FIZZED
Line_2147	THERE'S GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCE IS WEIRD
Line_2151	THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION ON SCALE AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE IS HAS MORE SOLID
Line_2152	I'M OKAY HELLO HELLO
Line_2153	YEP
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE'S LIKE A TOPPING OF SILT
Line_2157	WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOOK IT UP SO THEN IT'S GONNA MIX TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GONNA SETTLE AND IT'S GONNA TURN DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF SOIL
Line_2159	THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT WAS MY FRIEND HE'S SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIX TOGETHER TO MAKE SOIL
Line_2162	THEY'RE THE SAME CAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE'S A MAGNIFYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN
Line_2164	THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE TOP
Line_2165	NOTHING
Line_2166	THEY ALL HAVE PROPERTIES OF SOIL OH MY GOD
Line_2167	HELLO ANYBODY THERE ANYBODY COME IN COME IN OVER
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTAINS OR THE FARM LAND OR THE DELTA
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE
Line_2171	WIND WATER YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FELL INTO THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STONE AND THEN IT STARTED WEATHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF BROKE INTO THEN HIT A COUPLE ROCKS AND THEN SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
Line_2174	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVER A TON AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEN JUST GOT ERODED UNTIL
Line_2176	THE BOULDERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE
Line_2177	DELTA GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE DELTA GRAVEL HAS BEEN THERE WAY MORE THAN THE BOULDER HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING HAMMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWNSTREAM
Line_2179	HELLO ANY BODY THERE HELLO HELLO
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW BOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CHEMICAL WEATHERING PHYSICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHANGE ROCKS
Line_2182	LET'S GO C'MON DUDE LET'S
Line_2183	THERE'S WATER ACID RAIN THAT'S UM HITTING THE LIMESTONE AND DISINTEGRATING IT
Line_2184	WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS IT
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ACID RAIN IS COMING DOWN HITTING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE LIME
Line_2186	RAIN AND PRECIP
Line_2187	THE ROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT TOOK TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SANDSTONE THE RAIN FREEZE DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMAGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIMESTONE AFTER ACID RAIN AFTER A YEAR STILL HAD
Line_2190	IT DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HELLO ANYBODY THERE
Line_2192	IT ABRADED AND ERODED
Line_2193	ACID RAIN AND ALSO EROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CUT BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE ROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CUT BANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THING COLLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ISLANDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITION
Line_2199	THE STREAM TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE IN CLASS
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND EROSION
Line_2201	EROSION AND IT'S IN A DELTA AND A CANYON
Line_2202	THE WATER CAME OUT AND LEFT A TRAIL OF WATER I MEAN MUD
Line_2203	IT'S THE DELTA
Line_2204	DEPOSITION
Line_2205	DEPOSITION DEPOSITION
Line_2206	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
Line_2207	IT'S A VALLEY AND WHEN WE HAD THE FLOOD
Line_2208	GO GO GO GO GO
Line_2209	EROSION AND EARTH MATERIALS ARE CARRIED AWAY
Line_2210	DELTA DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT SAME THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREAM TABLES
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND ONE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2213	THAT FLAT IS MEANDERING AND THAT STEEP IS GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEEP SLOW IS GOING VERY FLAT FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING VERY SLOW CAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND CORNERS
Line_2215	FLOOD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY DEPOSITED AND ONE IT NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GONE UP
Line_2218	IT'S HIGHER IN THE FLOOD
Line_2219	IT GOES FASTER
Line_2220	THE WATER RAISES WHEN THERE'S A FLOOD
Line_2221	EARTHQUAKE
Line_2222	PLATES IN THE EARTH MOVING
Line_2223	VOLCANO ERUPTION
Line_2224	LAND SLIDE
Line_2225	SLOW
Line_2226	VERY SLOW
Line_2227	I THINK SLOW SLOW
Line_2228	MINERALS
Line_2229	THAT THEY'RE NOT ROCKS
Line_2230	MINERALS
Line_2231	WE USE THEM
Line_2232	MINERALS GO INTO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MINERALS
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCALE TO SEE HOW HARD ROCKS ARE WE DID THIS IN CLASS
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPPENS HERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIAMOND CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WHY DOES IT ALWAYS MAKE A MARK
Line_2237	IT DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
Line_2240	THIS IS SO SAD I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
Line_2241	MY STOMACH HURTS
Line_2242	ROCK CAN SCRATCH THE TILE
Line_2243	IT MAY
Line_2244	YOU'RE MIXING IT LIKE WITH WHAT THE SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS PICTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU'D GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	THE
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GRAPE
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
Line_2251	WE SEE THAT IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST ADD
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHANGE
Line_2253	FIRST TO THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU'D GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION IN THE END
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS A
Line_2258	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT CAUGHT IN THE COFFEE
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET CAUGHT IN THE FILTER
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPOR
Line_2263	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPOR AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND IN THE
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER
Line_2266	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I'VE LEARNED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWICE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE
Line_2270	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_2272	THAT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
Line_2273	IT MEANS BYE
Line_2274	THE PENNY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE CORK
Line_2275	THE PENNY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOAT MORE
Line_2277	JUST MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THAN SOLUTION
Line_2278	SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOAT ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LIGHTER IF WE ADD THE LIGHTER SALT SOLUTION LAST THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON TOP
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	CAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2286	THAT'S SO COOL
Line_2287	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH UM WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN'T DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE H TWO O
Line_2293	WE ARE TRY WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SUGAR
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_2295	FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHED
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT IN THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UM
Line_2299	I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH EACH SOLUTION WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I THAT
Line_2303	THEY SATURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	DIDN'T DO SCIENCE TODAY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THERE'S BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2308	SOLVENT AND SOLUTE
Line_2309	THEY'RE LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICE THAT THE MOLECULES ARE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT IT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE BAKING
Line_2314	THERE IS A THERE IS A PRECIPITATE LEFT OVER
Line_2315	YOU MIX SODIUM HYDROXIDE WATER AND HYDROCHLORIC
Line_2316	THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE IS ALL ONE MOLECULE THE WATER HAS TWO TYPES OF MOLECULES
Line_2317	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE ICE CUBES
Line_2320	THERE WERE BUBBLES
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCT OF FIZZING AND THEN IT SETTLED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOWED ON AND IT'S GETTING RUSTY
Line_2323	THE BIKE GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2324	THE RUST ON THE BIKE
Line_2325	THE GLOW STICK STARTED GLOWING
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FIZZED A LOT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T FIZZ
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FIZZES AND HAS A PRECIPITATE
Line_2329	YOU MADE A THREE UM
Line_2330	THAT BOTH THAT THE
Line_2331	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEIR MOLECULES LOOK
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LAYERS IN THE BAG
Line_2335	A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND A GAS
Line_2336	CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA
Line_2337	A SOLID A LIQUID AND A GAS
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE
Line_2339	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2340	THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BAG WEIGHS LESS
Line_2341	BECAUSE OF THE BAGS IS OPEN WHICH LET OUT ALL OF THE GASES
Line_2342	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL LAND
Line_2343	THERE IS HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2344	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2345	THEY'RE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2346	THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2347	THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2348	UM
Line_2349	UH
Line_2350	THEY'RE IN DIFFERENT
Line_2351	SOILS AND ROCKS AND LAND FORMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_2352	THERE'S WATER IN THE CRACKS AND THE WATER
Line_2353	WEATHERING OR I THINK IT WAS
Line_2354	FREEZING AND ABRASION
Line_2355	ABRASION
Line_2356	THE ROCKS BROKE APART
Line_2357	I SAID WILL YOU MARRY ME AND SHE SAID YES CAN BREAK ROCKS APART GOOD THINKING
Line_2358	THE TREE ROOT IS GROWING DOWN AND LOOKING FOR WATER AND THE ROCK IS IN IT'S WAY SO THE TREE ROOT BREAKS
Line_2359	THE WATER EXPANDS WHEN IT
Line_2360	WHEN THE WATER FREEZES IT EXPANDS
Line_2361	THEY WERE LIKE ROLLED DOWN A RIVER AND THEN THEY LIKE BROKE UP INTO SMALLER PIECES
Line_2362	AS THEY GO DOWN THE PIECES GET SMALLER
Line_2363	THE DELTA
Line_2364	FEELING EXTREMELY TERRIBLE TODAY SO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO
Line_2365	CHEMICAL WEATHERING AND STUFF LIKE THAT I GUESS
Line_2366	THE LIMESTONE IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE OF THE ACID
Line_2367	THE BASALT IS IMMUNE TO THE VINEGAR BUT THE LIMESTONE CAN BE
Line_2368	UM
Line_2369	BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2370	I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY
Line_2371	WELL NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENING TO THE STATUE SO
Line_2372	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2373	IS FORMING THE LIMESTONE INTO IT
Line_2374	UM
Line_2375	THE WATER IS WEATHERING AWAY THE LIMESTONE TO MAKE THE CAVE INTO A LIMES
Line_2376	PHYSICAL WEATHERING
Line_2377	YOU SHOWED ME THIS LAST TIME AND I EXPLAINED IT ALREADY SO I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT AGAIN
Line_2378	ROUND
Line_2379	WELL I DIDN'T KNOW
Line_2380	AND IF THEY ARE MADE OF BANANAS
Line_2381	BANANA AND NOW YOUR EYE BROWS LOOK LIKE BANANA AND NOW THE BANANA ROCK IS
Line_2382	THERE'S GREEN BANANA WEATHERING
Line_2383	WEATHERING HAPPENED THERE AND YOUR EYE BROWS LOOK LIKE BANANAS I SAID
Line_2384	BANANA WEATHERING
Line_2385	BANANA WEATHERING IT HAS HAPPENED TO THE BANANA STATUE WITH BANANA EYEBROWS THAT LOOKS LIKE YOUR BANANA EYEBROWS AND YOUR BANANA
Line_2386	I'M GOOD I'M VERY GOOD TODAY EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_2387	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EROSION AND DEPOSITION
Line_2388	THE ONE ON THE SLOPE GOT OUT MORE FARTHER THAN THE ONE ON THE NO SLOPE
Line_2389	WATER GOES MORE FASTER IF THERE'S MORE SLOPES THAN IF THERE'S NO SLOPE
Line_2390	I NOTICE THAT THERE'S LIKE THE WHERE IT'S STEEP THE WATER'S GOING MORE FASTER
Line_2391	THE WATER WITH THE SLOPE
Line_2392	ON FLAT SLOPE THE WATER IS FLOWING SLOWLY AND ON THE STEEP SLOPE THE WATER IS FLOWING QUICKLY
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FLOOD THINGS THAT WE DID AND STUFF
Line_2395	THE EROSION AND DEPOSITION IN THE FLOOD WATER SOURCE IS GOING MORE
Line_2396	ONE WITH FLOOD WITH CONDITION THE EROSION GO MORE FARTHER
Line_2397	FLOOD WATER IS MOVING FASTER
Line_2398	THE FLOOD WATER IS MOVING FASTER
Line_2399	THE FLOW OF WATER IN THE FLOOD CREEK IS MOVING A LOT FASTER
Line_2400	THE WATER WILL START FLOWING FASTER
Line_2401	THERE'S THREE ROCKS
Line_2402	WELL LIKE THE TWENTY FOUR SECOND OH I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
Line_2403	IT'S A LAND SLIDE WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
Line_2404	DID YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING
Line_2405	SLOW CHANGE MAYBE IT IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_2406	FAST CHANGE
Line_2407	THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE EARTHQUAKE WE'RE UNDER FIRE EARTHQUAKE
Line_2408	THE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED IT HAPPENED FAST THAT'S WHY WE ALL DIED
Line_2409	LONG TIME
Line_2410	IT'S HAPPENING VERY FAST IT'S HAPPENING VERY FAST
Line_2411	FAST THE VOLCANO'S ERUPTING FAST IT'S COMING MEGA FAST AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S COMING
Line_2412	FAST BUT MARNEY SEE I DON'T LIKE YOU BUT WILL MARRY ME
Line_2413	GOOD BUT I HAVE DO
Line_2414	EROSION AND DEPOSITION HAPPENING AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
Line_2415	EROSION
Line_2416	HOW I'M DOING TODAY THAT'S MY BUSINESS MIND YOUR OWN
Line_2417	EROSION AND DEPOSITION
Line_2418	THERE'S LIKE STREAM TABLES AND STUFF YOU KNOW
Line_2419	YOU KNOW LIKE THAT
Line_2420	BOTH IS LIKE
Line_2421	A VALLEY MAYBE A BIT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_2422	EROSION
Line_2423	I KNOW
Line_2424	IT'S AN ALLUVIAL FAN
Line_2425	DEPOSITION
Line_2426	DEPOSITION
Line_2427	STUFF THAT DOES OTHER STUFF AND THEN OTHER STUFF HAPPENS AND THEN WHEN THAT OTHER STUFF HAPPENS
Line_2428	ALL THAT STUFF AND IT DOES STUFF TO MAKE A VALLEY VALLEYS ARE CREATED BY ALL THAT STUFF
Line_2429	VALLEYS ARE CREATED BY STUFF STUFF STUFF VALLEYS ARE CREATED BY STUFF THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_2430	IT WAS NEITHER EROSION OR DEPOSITION THAT CREATED THIS DELTA IT WAS YOUR
Line_2431	DEPOSITION OR EROSION
Line_2432	DEPOSITION
Line_2433	IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THOSE LIKE STUFF THAT LIKE ROCKS AND
Line_2434	THE DIAMOND IS A LOT SHINY MORE SHINY THAN THE LIKE GYPSUM WHATEVER IT'S
Line_2435	MINERALS ARE MORE LIKE MINERALS THAN ANTI MINERAL MAYBE
Line_2436	I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW I'M BUSY WATCHING
Line_2437	PAY ATTENTION RIGHT NOW I'M PLAYING WITH FROGS
Line_2438	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2439	IT'S A MOHS HARDNESS SCALE
Line_2440	NOTHING AND THEN I THINK DIAMOND'S RIGHT AGAIN
Line_2441	NO
Line_2442	THE DIAMOND DRAW A LINE ON IT
Line_2443	THE HARDNESS
Line_2444	I JUST DREW ON YOUR FACE WITH A SHARPY I'M SORRY MARNEY
Line_2445	THE BRIGHTNESS WELL THIS CONNECTS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CAUSE WE MADE FLASHLIGHTS
Line_2446	THIS IS THIS IS DOING WITH WHAT WE DID THAT WE MADE FLASHLIGHTS
Line_2447	S R L SOIL ROCKS AND LAND FORMS
Line_2448	BRIGHTNESS
Line_2449	THEY LOOK A LOT MORE DIFFERENT
Line_2450	ON ONE TOO
Line_2451	YOU KNOW LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS AND WHERE THE SHADOWS ARE IN THAT MINERAL
Line_2452	LIKE BRIGHTNESS
Line_2453	SOMEBODY CRACKED A A ROCK WITH A PICK AXE
Line_2454	I'M NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION I'M JUST HAVING FUN PLAYING WITH YOUR
Line_2455	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION I WAS JUST PLAYING WITH YOUR COMPUTER PROGRAM
Line_2456	IT'S MARKING
Line_2457	TILE GOT A Z ON IT
Line_2458	IT CAME FROM THE MINERAL
Line_2459	THEY'RE THAT I NOTICED THAT THAT GUY HAS TWO RIGHT HANDS IT'S CREEPY TRUST ME
Line_2460	YOU WOULD NEED THE LUSTER THE BREAK THE STREAK THE HARDNESS
Line_2461	IT DID NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTIONS
Line_2462	THIS MINERAL EXHIBITED A CLEAVE
Line_2463	THAT IS A STREAK TEST
Line_2464	I THINK THAT IT IS GYPSUM
Line_2465	YUP
Line_2466	THAT IT DID NOT SCRATCH
Line_2467	CAUSE BECAUSE THEY BOTH SCRATCH
Line_2468	IT TELLS US THAT THIS MINERAL CAN BE GRAPHITE OR GYPSUM
Line_2469	MALACHITE MICA OPAL CALCITE FLUORITE GALENA AND GOLD
Line_2470	BECAUSE THEY DON'T FIT THE DESCRIPTION
Line_2471	NO NO
Line_2472	IT FRACTURED
Line_2473	BECAUSE THEY CLEAVE INSTEAD OF FRACTURE
Line_2474	BECAUSE THE ROCK WE HAD FRACTURED BUT THOSE ONE DIDN'T
Line_2475	WE CAN CROSS OUT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR QUARTZ
Line_2476	YEAH YEAH I GUESS
Line_2477	WE HAVE QUARTZ
Line_2478	THEY NARROWED OUR OPTIONS DOWN TO QUARTZ
Line_2479	ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
Line_2480	ABSOLUTE
Line_2481	DEFINITELY NOT
Line_2482	YOU KNOW
Line_2483	I DON'T REALLY CARE I'M JUST LIKE WATCHING A COOL THING IT'S THE IGNEOUS ROCKS YOU KNOW IT'S SICK
Line_2484	METAMORPHIC ROCKS I'M JUST PLAYING WITH THE IGNEOUS ROCKS SO SHUT UP
Line_2485	YOU KNOW STUFF OKAY
Line_2486	IT RELATES TO SOME MINERAL STUFF
Line_2487	A MINERAL PROPERTIES TABLE
Line_2488	MINERAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
Line_2489	THIS IS USEFUL FOR IDENTIFYING MINERALS I GUESS
Line_2490	MINERALS
Line_2491	HARDNESS I JUST SAID THAT SO WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME AGAIN BUT YEAH I JUST SAID HARDNESS
Line_2492	THAT SOME OF THE THINGS DON'T WORK
Line_2493	HOW EASILY IT'LL GET KILLED TO DEATH OR NO THAT'S THAT'S TESTING THE BREAK
Line_2494	YEAH MAN
Line_2495	THE COLOR
Line_2496	NO
Line_2497	JUST NO YAWN
Line_2498	I THINK THAT IT'S GYPSUM GYPSUM GYPSUM
Line_2499	NOTHING'S THE FINGERNAIL DIDN'T SCRATCH IT YAWN
Line_2500	NOT LETTING ME PRESS THE GREEN ARROW
Line_2501	MEANS TO BE YOU KNOW
Line_2502	THEY DIDN'T HOW WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_2503	THAT THEY THEY WERE TOO SOFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF OF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	UHM THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BOUNCING OFF EVERYTHING AND UHM AND UH AWAY
Line_2509	REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BOUNCING OFF ALL THE MIRRORS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIKE BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WHITE LIGHTS
Line_2515	IT'S WHITE
Line_2516	EVERYWHERE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE BALL THE LIGHT BECOMES BLUE
Line_2520	THE RAY HITTING THE BALL IS WHITE AND THE RAYS COMING OFF THE BALL ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BALL IS IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2523	THE LIGHT IS HITTING THE BALL AND THEN THE
Line_2524	I THINK IT GETS ABSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BALL
Line_2525	THE BALL IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLUE LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNGRY
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE ONES BEHIND IT BURNED OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TOO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TOO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WORK
Line_2537	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE BIOSPHERE
Line_2539	THIS IS THE BIOSPHERE IT IS
Line_2540	EACH ANIMAL HAS A PLACE IN THE ECOSYSTEM AND UM THEY ARE
Line_2541	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR UM FOR THE
Line_2542	PLANTS UM
Line_2543	BEING A PRODUCER MEANS UM YOU PRODUCE THE ENERGY YOURSELF
Line_2544	A PLANT MAKES IT'S OWN ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND UM DIRT
Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE
Line_2546	IT MEANS THAT YOU EAT OTHERS THINGS TO GET
Line_2547	ANIMALS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN THE ENERGY TO GET IT
Line_2549	IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THEY DECOMPOSE
Line_2550	YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS AND HERB
Line_2551	PLANTS
Line_2552	HERBIVORES ONLY EAT PLANT
Line_2553	ANIMALS BEARS LIONS POLAR BEARS BUNNIES YEAH ALL ANIMALS
Line_2554	A PRIMARY
Line_2555	AN OMNIVORE
Line_2556	HERBIVORE
Line_2557	THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS
Line_2558	A
Line_2559	THEY UM TURN THE LEAVES AND STUFF
Line_2560	THEY TURNS INTO DIRT
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SALT
Line_2567	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID IN THIS PICTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES THE DISSOLVING
Line_2570	THE MIXED END RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PEANUTS RAISINS AND M AND MS
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWS THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIXTURE
Line_2578	BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILTER OUT A SOLUTE IN A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WAIT NO IT'S A SOLUTION SORRY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDERS MIXED WITH THE WATER GRAPE BEING MADE AND THE POWDERS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER IN A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCALE TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	IT WOULD TASTE SUGAR AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIGHER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO
Line_2593	THE TASTE IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS OH
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATER'S IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COOL AID BY HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE COOL AID
Line_2597	I'M HAVING A BAD DAY MARNI
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE WERE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TYPE OF GAS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK C O TWO WAS CREATED
Line_2601	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TERM IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE REACTANT
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBBLY
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING IN WATER IS MISSING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THINGS MOLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APART
Line_2611	THE REACTANT MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PRODUCT MOLECULE
Line_2612	UM REPEAT PLEASE
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE OF MOLECULE IN THE SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING MOLECULES FROM THE HYDRAULIC ACID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT FOGGY
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAR AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVED INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FIZZED UP AND THEN CALMED DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SECOND PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FIZZ
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ONTO THE PAN RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NO THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BYE MARNI I HAD A LOT OF FUN MAKING SANDWICHES RIDING ON UNICORNS AND PLAYING MARIO
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2627	THE SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
Line_2630	TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYED ON THE TOP
Line_2634	ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THEME HERE IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2638	SOLID MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE
Line_2642	I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	I'M JUST GUESSING BUT IS IT EQUIVALENCY
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED WELL
Line_2648	WELL THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	CONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY
Line_2650	THAT TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	GOOD BYE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
Line_2656	WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MARNI I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	UM THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICLE SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALL THEM TOOLS THAT WE USE TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY SURE MARNI I'M BAD AT SCIENCE
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BETTER
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2661	I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS A LOT MORE GRAPETASTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE DARK COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TASTE REALLY GROSS AND JUST REALLY DISGUSTING AND JUST REALLY REALLY GROSS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TASTE PRETTY BLAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLAND AND A LOT MORE TASTELESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WELL YOU CAN'T UNLESS YOU TASTE IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THE SOLIDS AND IT SHARE A DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND A SIEVE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS UM STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZED
Line_2685	TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SIEVE AND THE STONES STAYED ON TOP
Line_2687	I THINK WE USE THE SIEVE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES THAN THE HOLES IN THE SIEVE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFEE FILTER
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE THAT THE SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOU ARE PUTTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
Line_2692	TODAY MARNI WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTE A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE UM SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT MARNI BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HI OH
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	C IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2698	I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2700	THE PENNY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORK
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOAT
Line_2703	I'M OKAY I'M ON CRUTCHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY'RE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE OF AS EACH OTHER
Line_2715	WE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING UM SATURATED
Line_2723	IT UM BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGURED THIS OUT BY WEIGHING
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATED
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE UM CITRIC ACID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SUGAR OR MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH A SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE C IS SALT OR I MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPSOM SALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
Line_2737	I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST KINDA BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
Line_2740	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2741	REACTANTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTANT
Line_2745	SOLVENT
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF WEIRD STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GAS
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GAS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERY FOGGY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED UP AND FIZZED A LOT
Line_2754	THERE'S SOME LITTLE WHITE STUFF ON THEY BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY'RE MIXING SODIUM HYDROXIDE WITH
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECULES WERE ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPLE
Line_2757	IT'S A UM THEY'RE A MIX OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACTION THING
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PINK
Line_2760	THE FINAL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ON SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE'S DEFINITELY A REACTION HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FIZZING
Line_2763	THE THE BUBBLES IN THE CARBONATED WATER ARE CARBON BUBBLES
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOAKING INTO IT'S BONES
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE IS REACTING IT'S JUST RUSTING
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE BIKE
Line_2768	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING THEM TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT UM ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOWS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
Line_2773	UM A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2775	THIS TELLS WHAT THE EVENTUAL MASS IT
Line_2776	THIS TELLS US THAT
Line_2777	HOW I'M REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARTIE
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNI
Line_2780	MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MIX HAS THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE PEANUTS THE RAISINS AND THE SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS
Line_2783	THE PEANUTS RAISINS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPPENS MARNI IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISINTEGRATES IN THE WATER AND THERE'S JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT'S JUST CLEAR SO YEAH DEAL WITH IT MARNI
Line_2786	THE SOLUTION
Line_2787	SOLUTE
Line_2788	A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IN THE WATER AND THAT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	BYE MARNI I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU GOODBYE I'LL SEE YOU IN YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GETTING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLAYS A SOLVENT OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH
Line_2797	SORRY MARNEY I HAVE TO GO OKAY I'LL SEE YOU LATER BYE
Line_2798	I'M DOING GREAT MARNI HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE'RE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GONNA BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNI YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TOOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNI THE SAND IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOES
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBBLES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THROUGH THE FAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE HOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PEBBLES ARE GETTING STUCK IN THE FAN KAY MARNI
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2807	A SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBBLES THE SMALLER PEBBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THAT WOULD TAKE A WHILE
Line_2810	CAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GONNA WORK ON TO THIS
Line_2811	I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ONTO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WOULD THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALIZED THAT THE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREEN
Line_2814	USE A SIEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBBLES
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM THAT THE LITTLE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT WILL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	EVAPORATION
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNI
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT RESOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GRAPE FANTASTIC POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GONNA BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	WELL ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAD MORE FLAVOR
Line_2827	ONE WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	IT HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	SWEETER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRAPE
Line_2832	ADD MORE GRAPE FANTASTIC
Line_2833	MARNI I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN OKAY BYE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RESIDUE
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SUGAR
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SCALE
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE C IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ICE THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PICTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFY SALAD BEANS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATE GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLES
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WENT BACK TOGETHER AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALT WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALL THEM A SOLUTE
Line_2863	THE SAND STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLE THE WATER IS PLAYING IN THIS PICTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE ROLES PLAYS IN THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WAY MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE MIXED
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREATER
Line_2877	A MIXTURE
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MA'AM
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MA'AM
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE ME MA'AM BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWN AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO A A SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	I'M HORRIBLE TODAY THANKS FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS THE MIX AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS AND THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PREDICTION MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SORRY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ON IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DETERMINE IS BY TASTING THEM
Line_2900	WE ARE SEEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASES
Line_2909	YOU IDENTIFIED THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUBSTANCE
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLED
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIXED TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I SEE A REACTANT
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CHEMICALS THING
Line_2917	IT'S AN ADDITION PROBLEM
Line_2918	I'M I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2919	THE BAG CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MORE
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNEW THAT QUESTION OH IT'S STILL ON
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURE
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE WHERE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS GREEN
Line_2927	THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S WHERE TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE OTHER TWO ARE MIXTURES
Line_2930	THEY WERE TAKING RAISINS AND OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY'RE TAKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY'RE BRINGING MIX TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY'RE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER
Line_2934	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SAND STAYED ON TOP
Line_2937	SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND TO SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAME
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	WE CALL THAT A SOLUTE
Line_2944	BECAUSE THE GREY STUFF UM DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN'T BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED AND THE OTHER AND IT CAN'T BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIENT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE
Line_2953	THE THE
Line_2954	SOLUTE IS WHERE ONE INGREDIENT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVENT
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THE IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY KEEP THEY'RE SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT LOSES ANY MASS
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIXTURE AND THE STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF IT'S PARTICLE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2965	THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE FOUND THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_2970	WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	SURE IT TWO TWO THINGS THAT KEEP THEIR PROPERTY
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILTERS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UM BECAUSE UM THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLE
Line_2975	PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SIZE
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	PARTICLE SIZE AND UM MAGNET MAGNETS
Line_2978	PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT UM WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
Line_2980	I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WENT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM
Line_2981	I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICED THAT THE SIEVE STAYED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FOR EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	DON'T GO MARNI BYE
Line_2986	WE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE THEY ARE
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_2991	THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE UM MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE GRAPE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAPE
Line_2993	I THINK THE UM ONE WITH LESS GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TASTE IS NOT AS THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WATER MARTIE
Line_2998	BYE MARTIE
Line_2999	BAD
Line_3000	WE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU CAN TELL IF IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED IF UM IT'S DARKER
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3003	MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTED
Line_3006	BY THEIR WEIGHT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS THE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3009	BAD
Line_3010	WE LEARNED ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3011	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY AND THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3013	IN SOLUTION THEY WOULD SINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOAT
Line_3014	YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRASTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED CAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY
Line_3016	THE MORE DENSE ONE WILL SINK THE
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYS AT THE TOP
Line_3019	THEIR DENSITY CAME THE THEIR DENSITY BECAME THE SAME
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHTER ONE
Line_3021	IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREEN IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS THAN IT
Line_3022	SEE YOU THURSDAY
Line_3023	UM YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3024	IT'S FOGGY AND THERE'S IT'S ALL BLENDED INTO
Line_3025	THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3027	THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_3031	PARTS FOR THIS SOLUTION AND THE CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3033	THEY'RE REACHING THEIR LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DENSITY STUFF
Line_3035	DENSITY YEAH AND AND SATURATE
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBSTANCE NUMBER ONE
Line_3040	I'M DOING AWESOME
Line_3041	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	RECENT
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALL THESE REACTANTS
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PRODUCT
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3049	I DON'T KNOW HELP ME
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3051	ALL OF THE MOLECULES IN THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THE THE UM
Line_3052	CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE OF
Line_3055	THE ICE CUBES ARE FLOATING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FOGGY
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLED
Line_3058	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	IT IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANT TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE BIKE
Line_3062	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM FOLDED IN HALF
Line_3063	THE GLOW STICK IS BEING GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
Line_3064	YES A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	CONSERVATION
Line_3066	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEEN HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GRAPE TASTE IS ADDED TO THE WATER
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	LEARNED ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE A NUTS I SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE A
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKEN APART
Line_3075	THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A
Line_3076	CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FILTER
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULLED ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT'S LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED
Line_3080	UM YOU WE CALL IT A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARS AND GOES INTO THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER
Line_3082	NO I DID
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	BYE BYE A CAN YOU REPEATS MY SENTENCE
Line_3085	GOOD HATE YOUR FACE WHY ARE YOU SO UGLY
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3087	THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPEARED
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISAPPEARS AFTER BEING MIXED WITH THE WATER
Line_3090	THE SOLVENT
Line_3091	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	IT GETS OKAY
Line_3095	MARNEY
Line_3096	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND NOW IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER
Line_3097	A SOLUTION I THINK HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE RIGHT
Line_3098	IN A MIXTURE YES IN A SOLUTION NO
Line_3099	THE CITRIC DISAPPEARED INTO THE WATER
Line_3100	DO YOU THINK ANNOYING
Line_3101	WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_3102	THE SALT'S GETTING IN THE
Line_3103	SHE'S REALLY CREEPY
Line_3104	IT GOES INSIDE THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER
Line_3105	THE REPEAT CAUSE THEY'RE BEING
Line_3106	REPEAT
Line_3107	CAUSE IT'S A SOLUTION AND SCIENCE IS COOL AND
Line_3108	THERE ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MULTIPLE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY
Line_3109	CAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE REST OF THE MIXTURE
Line_3111	THAT GRAVEL TOO BIG IN THROUGH A
Line_3112	CAUSE THE GRAVEL WON'T GO THROUGH IT BUT THE WATER WILL
Line_3113	THE SAFETY PINS ARE MAGNETIC THE OTHERS ARE NOT
Line_3114	MAGNETISM AND MAGNETS
Line_3115	A SCREEN
Line_3116	BECAUSE THERE'S MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE METAL OF THE SAFETY CLIPS
Line_3117	SORRY OKAY UH THE SAFETY CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC AND THERE THE ONLY METAL IN THOSE
Line_3118	ME SO WAS RIGHT
Line_3119	I WAS SO RIGHT
Line_3120	NO
Line_3121	DRY MIXTURES AND HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3122	ADIOS NOT SO AMIGOS
Line_3123	GRAPE FANTASTIC STUFF GETTING POURED AND MIXED WITH WATER
Line_3124	DON'T KNOW
Line_3125	ONE IS DARKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3126	THEY'RE LESS TRANSPARENT
Line_3127	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR
Line_3128	TODAY I MIGHT WIN AND I MIGHT
Line_3129	THERE WAS LESS POWDER GO IN THE WATER AND THE AND AND EARTH IS BALANCED
Line_3130	IT'LL BE SWEETER
Line_3131	THE TASTE OKAY I NOTICED SOMETHING WRONG THERE'S A THREE SPOONFULS FOR THE SIX SPOONS AND THERE'S A SIX SPOONFULS OF THE THREE SPOONFULS
Line_3132	THE PUT LESS WATER AND ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER IN THEM
Line_3133	THE WATER
Line_3134	SAYONARA SUCKER

Line_3138	THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE
Line_3139	YES SIR UM REPEAT PLEASE
Line_3140	THE ONES TO THE RIGHT ARE GETTING DENSER
Line_3141	WAS NOT FUNNY MARNI WILL YOU PLEASE
Line_3142	THE THIRD ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE SECOND
Line_3143	I THINK THE SECOND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3144	THE SECOND IS THE MOST DILUTED OR THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3145	I HATE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE SUCKS
Line_3146	UH SOMEONE YAWNED I YOU
Line_3147	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE LEARNING
Line_3148	ORANGE
Line_3149	SCIENCE SUCKS AND I HATE IT SO I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
Line_3150	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3151	IT'S WATER WITH SALT INSIDE OF IT OMG
Line_3152	IT'S SATURATED IT'S SATURATED SATURATED SATURATED SATURATED
Line_3153	THE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3154	IT'S SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE THE WATER'S SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT CAUSE IT
Line_3155	THERE'S STILL SOME SALT LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR
Line_3156	THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING BUT JUST WITH SUGAR
Line_3157	IT'S GETTING LIKE IT CAN'T HOLD THE SUGAR ANY LONGER
Line_3158	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE WATER EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_3159	YOU MINUS SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN MINUS FIFTY EQUALS SEVENTEEN AND WE ALL LEARNED THAT IN KINDERGARTEN
Line_3160	EATING FISH AND BEGINS HE'S GOT IT I SEE IT
Line_3161	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I'M NOT VERY SMART AND I'M ONLY IN KINDERGARTEN
Line_3162	BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MASS
Line_3163	WE HAD A WE HAD A SOLUBILITY CHART THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT TO LIKE SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE WHICH ONE WAS WHICH
Line_3164	OKAY
Line_3165	YOU'RE POURING THE VINEGAR AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY BAKING SODA INTO A WATER AND THEN IT'S FIZZ
Line_3166	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3167	I FORGOT MARNI
Line_3168	THE VINEGAR IS REACTANT THE BAKING SODA IS REACTANT AND THE AND THE WATER LIKE THE CUP IS A PRODUCT
Line_3169	SHUT UP AND REPEAT THAT PETER SHUT UP
Line_3170	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3171	REACTANT
Line_3172	REACTANT
Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK BUT I THINK I I THINK THERE WAS
Line_3174	I SEE IN THE VINEGAR I SEE OXYGEN AND
Line_3175	THERE ARE HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN ATOMS IN THE VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEANS THERE ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT TYPES
Line_3177	THE ATOMS MUST BE DIFFERENT
Line_3178	IT'S FIZZING FOR A LONG LONG LONG TIME
Line_3179	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER
Line_3180	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3181	IT'S FIZZING FIZZING FIZZING AND THERE'S A CLOCK
Line_3182	PARTICIPATE IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED
Line_3183	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_3184	TWO OF THE ATOMS ARE BLUE TWO OF THE ATOMS ARE BLUE
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE OH MY GOSH THAT'S SO
Line_3186	UH THERE WAS A REACTION THAT WAS LIKE THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY COOL AND I LIKE
Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SUBSTANCE IS POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FIZZED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AND NOW IT'S CLEAR
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE
Line_3190	IT STARTED FIZZING SO AND WHEN IT'S FIZZING LIKE THAT IT SHOWS THAT A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR
Line_3192	IT JUST TURNED GREEN THAT WAS GREY
Line_3193	A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED GREEN WITH THE DRIP OF GREEN BLUE
Line_3194	IT TURNED IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TURNED
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION CAUSE THE WATER TURNED BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT'S TURNING THE WATER'S TURNING PURPLE
Line_3197	IT DIDN'T WELL NO I DIDN'T THERE WAS TOO MUCH IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST LIKE STAYED
Line_3198	WE COULD
Line_3199	THE YOU CLOSED AND IT WENT TO
Line_3200	THERE'S REACTIONS THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE
Line_3201	I SEE GAS I SEE LIQUID AND I SEE SOLID
Line_3202	I SEE BLUE I SEE GREY AND I SEE SILVER THE GAS IS SILVER THE GAS IS YELLOW
Line_3203	YOU'RE WEIGHING TWO ON TWO DIFFERENT SCALES
Line_3204	ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN CAUSE IT HAS AIR INSIDE IT TRAPPED INSIDE OF IT
Line_3205	THE AIR MOLECULES ARE TRAPPED INSIDE THE CLOSED BAG BUT LET OUT AND IT BALANCED INSIDE THE OPEN BAG
Line_3206	WE'VE BEEN MAKING FOR OUR RED
Line_3207	A HUMAN BODY IS A SYSTEM
Line_3208	THIS IS A PART OF THE SYSTEM
Line_3209	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_3210	EVERYTHING SUPPORTS THE CAR
Line_3211	THIS WHOLE BODY IS A SYSTEM
Line_3212	IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT WHAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IT IS
Line_3213	IT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT THEY IT HAS
Line_3214	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3215	THE EARTH IS PRETTY MUCH HAVE EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT A SYSTEM
Line_3216	I THINK EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE IT HAS COUNTRIES AND THINGS AND THAT WHAT MAKES IT A SYSTEM
Line_3217	THEY WORK TOGETHER
Line_3218	I THINK IT'S AN OCEAN AND ISLAND
Line_3219	I REMEMBER THAT UM THE LIKE POINTED OTHER PARTS OF EARTH
Line_3220	THE BIOSPHERE IS THE LAND
Line_3221	IT'S MADE OUT OF OUT OF THE EARTH
Line_3222	I SEE DESERTS AND OTHER LANDS THAT MOSTLY HAVE ANIMALS
Line_3223	THEY ALL HAVE SOME THEY ALL HAVE LAND
Line_3224	LOOKS LIKE UM A UM A FOOD CHAIN
Line_3225	I THINK IT'S ABOUT THINGS EATING THINGS LIKE ANIMALS EATING OTHER PLANTS
Line_3226	I NOTICED THAT UM LOTS OF BUGS HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY
Line_3227	THEY'RE LIKE SAYING WHAT THE ANIMALS THING IS
Line_3228	I AM LEARNING ABOUT CATERPILLARS AND DECOMPOSERS AND COMPOSERS
Line_3229	COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY DECOMPOSERS
Line_3230	COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY DECOMPOSERS
Line_3231	OMNIVORES EAT BERRIES AND
Line_3232	A CARNIVORES DOES NOT JUST EAT
Line_3233	THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
Line_3234	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY CAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCER
Line_3235	BEING A COMPOSERS YOU EAT THE PRODUCERS SO THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR
Line_3236	A DECOMPOSER EATS THE CONSUMER
Line_3237	GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUMER
Line_3238	THE CONSUMERS ARE THE BUNNY AND THE BIRD AND THE LIZARD
Line_3239	A PRIMARY A RABBITS ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONSUMER
Line_3240	BACTERIA AND FUNGI
Line_3241	IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING EACH
Line_3242	FINISH IT I STILL HAVE TO FINISH IT OKAY CARNIVORES OMNIVORES DECOMPOSERS WHAT
Line_3243	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGEST
Line_3244	THEY ARE UHM THE GROW GET ENERGY
Line_3245	THESE ARE PRODUCERS AND THESE THE CONSUMERS AND THESE ARE THE DECOMPOSERS
Line_3246	THE PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_3247	THEY GET THEIR OWN
Line_3248	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE THE PRODUCER THE PRODUCER HAS THEIR ITS ENERGY IT EATS
Line_3249	A CONSUMER IS THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER TO GET ITS ENERGY
Line_3250	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THE CONSUMER EATS THE PRODUCER
Line_3251	IT'S THE ONE THAT EATS PLANTS
Line_3252	IT'S THE ONE THAT EATS PLANTS AND
Line_3253	SYSTEMS
Line_3254	CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSERS
Line_3255	IT IS ABOUT THE FOOD WEB AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_3256	THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM
Line_3257	ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THAT GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PRODUCE SOME WITH FOOD
Line_3258	A IS ALL ABOUT DECOMPOSERS
Line_3259	THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
Line_3260	WE TALKED FIRST SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMERS
Line_3261	AN HERBIVORE IS A HERBIVORE IT EATS PLANTS
Line_3262	A CARNIVORE IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AN OMNIVORE AN OMNIVORES WOULD EAT BERRIES AND MEAT
Line_3263	THEY EAT MEAT INSIDE OF THEIR ERA
Line_3264	OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_3265	THEY WOULD EAT DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3266	THIS IS A DECOMPOSER OR RED WIGGLE WORM IT DECOMPOSES DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN INTO SOIL
Line_3267	A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3268	DECOMPOSERS CREATE SOIL SOIL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR FECES IS SOIL
Line_3269	THE WASTE MATERIALS TURNED INTO SOIL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEEKS
Line_3270	SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY THE UNHEALTHY THINGS AND MAKE THEM HEALTHY AGAIN
Line_3271	GOOD
Line_3272	EAGLES
Line_3273	ECOSYSTEMS
Line_3274	ECOSYSTEMS
Line_3275	THE EARTH ALL SYSTEMS
Line_3276	IT IS A SYSTEM
Line_3277	IT IS A LIVING SYSTEM
Line_3278	IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_3279	I SEE A
Line_3280	IT IS THE HUMAN BODY AND IT IS ALSO A SYSTEM
Line_3281	A HUMAN BODY SYSTEM
Line_3282	THE SPACE I'M DOING FINE
Line_3283	I'M SORRY SAY IT AGAIN I WASN'T LISTENING
Line_3284	HEY MARNI HOW YOU DOING BABY
Line_3285	IT'S A SYSTEM THAT'S BUILT TOGETHER
Line_3286	WELL YOU'RE A SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A COMPUTER THAT'S RIGHT
Line_3287	I DON'T HAVE A SCIENCE CLASS BUT IT IS A SYSTEM I'M IN ELEMENTARY NOT NOT MIDDLE SCHOOL
Line_3288	MAN HAS PANTS IN LOUISVILLE LOUISVILLE LOUISVILLE
Line_3289	IT IS STOP BEEP BOPPING MY MARNI CAN HEAR YOU
Line_3290	THAT IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE SOMETHING
Line_3291	IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT IS HUMAN
Line_3292	IT IS SHOWING THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND THE UH SKELETAL
Line_3293	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3294	THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE HARDEST PART OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3295	THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE WRONG HEART RESPIRATORY
Line_3296	IT IS BUILT UP OF MANY GRAVITY PULLS AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH THE EARTH
Line_3297	IT IS A SYSTEM GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH
Line_3298	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL PULL MOVE
Line_3299	UH YEAH THE SAME THING REPEAT PLEASE WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ME LISTEN TO ME
Line_3300	YEAST IS NOT IN THE HUMAN HOW WEIRD
Line_3301	THERE ARE ABOUT A MILLION AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I DON'T THINK WE EVER LEARNED ABOUT IT
Line_3302	BIOSPHERES ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BIOSPHERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
Line_3303	THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OF GRASS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER LIKE A NORMAL THING
Line_3304	THERE IS A DESERT A FOREST AND A WET
Line_3305	THEY ARE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH
Line_3306	THE REST OF THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OUT OF LIKE WELL LIKE WETLANDS AND STUFF
Line_3307	YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND ANYMORE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
Line_3308	FOR THE LAST TIME HOW DOES THIS COMPUTER
Line_3309	OH LOOK
Line_3310	THE YEAST STUDY THINGEE MAJIGY
Line_3311	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE YEAST IS BREAKING IT'S DORMANCY
Line_3312	THAT THE YEAST IS BREAKING IT'S DORMANCY I JUST SAID THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME
Line_3313	IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS ALIVE
Line_3314	THAT THEY ARE YEAH I WANT HEADSETS FOR MY X BOX
Line_3315	HOW DID YOU DUMP IT IN THE TRASH AGAIN
Line_3316	THAT THE YEAST IS ALIVE LIKE FRANKENSTEIN
Line_3317	ONE WHEAT PLANT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH STUFF
Line_3318	THAT IT GROW THAT PLANTS START OUT AS A SEED AND THEN TURN TO A PLANT
Line_3319	IT MAY NEED WATER SUNLIGHT AND C O TWO
Line_3320	SPACE ROOM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE CAUSE HUMANS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUID
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUD
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AIR WHAT IT MATTERS ON IF IT'S C O TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON DONOXIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OXYGEN FOR US
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF A SYSTEM
Line_3327	YES CAUSE IT COULD DRY THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBURGER I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBURGERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOOD SO NO
Line_3330	IT SHOWS PLANT WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE PHLOEM AND XYLEM
Line_3332	THOSE ARE SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS OR YEAST
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	THAT THEY'RE MUSCLE CELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE YOU EXERCISE
Line_3337	THERE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS TO MUSCLES
Line_3338	THAT THEY ARE PART OF YOUR BRAIN
Line_3339	I SEE SKIN CELLS
Line_3340	THAT THEY MAKE UP YOUR SKIN
Line_3341	CELLS AND MADE OUT OF THE SKELETAL DIGESTIVE NERVOUS MUSCULAR AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3342	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE OUT OF FUR
Line_3343	HOW PLANTS GET NUTRIENTS
Line_3344	THEY ALL FORM THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3345	THE LUNGS THE BRONCHI THE DIAPHLAM THE BRONCHI THE NOSE AND MOUTH
Line_3346	IT'S KEEPS YOUR BODY ALIVE
Line_3347	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE HUMAN BODY BREATHES AND
Line_3348	BREATHING IS ABOUT PROVIDING THE BODY WITH OXYGEN
Line_3349	TO PROVIDE YOUR BODY WITH OXYGEN IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR BODY WITH OXYGEN YOUR BODY WILL
Line_3350	ABOUT THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3351	THAT IS THE ALVEOLI WHICH IS
Line_3352	THIS IS THIS IS A HUMAN DISPLAYING OF THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3353	THE LUNGS ALVEOLI BRONCHI BRONCHIOLES TRACHEA MOUTH NOSE THE END
Line_3354	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM ALLOWS THE HUMAN BODY TO BREATHE
Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECOND OF ALL IT'S ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3356	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR CELLS TO GET OXYGEN AND CARRY THEM TO YOUR
Line_3358	TO
Line_3359	FIRST OF ALL I CAN'T CLICK ON IT SO
Line_3360	GEE I CHOOSE GEE
Line_3361	I THINK THAT THE LUNGS PROVIDE AIR TO ALL THE CELLS IN OUR BODY AND GET RID OF C O TWO
Line_3362	FINE HOW ARE
Line_3363	BECAUSE IT'S A LEAF AND I TOLD YOU WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES RIGHT HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
Line_3364	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3365	THEY'RE LEAVES
Line_3366	FINE
Line_3367	ABOUT THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND WHAT WE USE TO FOR WE TO FOR US TO BREATHE
Line_3368	IT IS A LEAF AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PHLOEM AND THE XYLEM
Line_3369	IT IS
Line_3370	THE SMALL SACS AT AND THE END OF THE BROCHIOLES IN THE LUNGS ALL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN THE LUNGS HAPPEN IN THE ALVEOLI
Line_3371	UH WE'VE BEEN UM
Line_3372	THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE EARTHS ECOSYSTEM
Line_3373	UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE EARTH ON A CAR
Line_3374	BECAUSE THE WHEELS AND THE AXLE ARE UM BOTH PART OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE CAR ROLL
Line_3375	UH TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS IN THE CAR
Line_3377	A SEE UM THE AXLES AND THE WHEELS WHICH HELP THE CAR MOVE
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS IN THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE VEINS THE LUNGS AND THE HEART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3381	UM IT HAS THE EARTH IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SYSTEMS LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS IN IT TO HELP THE EARTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREES HOUSES AND AN OCEAN
Line_3384	THEY'RE PART OF UH NATURE AND HUMANS
Line_3385	I THINK THE BIOSPHERE'S MADE UP OF ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND TREES AND NO HOUSES AROUND
Line_3386	I SEE UH ALL THE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE EARTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BURROW FOREST THE WETLANDS AND THE DESERT
Line_3387	THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP REPRESENT A WHOLE KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3388	MOST OF THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE UP OF SAND AND LIVING CREATURES
Line_3389	IS ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND WHAT THEY KILL
Line_3390	THE FOOD WEB MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF ECOSYSTEMS THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT THEM
Line_3391	NO
Line_3392	GOOD
Line_3393	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3394	WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
Line_3395	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING THIS
Line_3396	NO WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING THIS
Line_3397	IT GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_3398	BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT GOES INTO THEM AND THE SUN DUH
Line_3399	GETTING ALL THE FOOD FROM THE THING THAT EATS THE PLANT TO GET THE SUNS ENERGY AND WHATNOT
Line_3400	IS ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT GROW ON THE GROUND AND BACTERIA YOU GET IT
Line_3401	THE THE GRASS
Line_3402	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3403	THE CONSUMERS EAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_3404	DEER EATS THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT EATS THE GRASS
Line_3405	CAUSE CAUSE IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_3406	A CARNIVORE EATS MEAT
Line_3407	I ALREADY TOLD YOU MEAT
Line_3408	CAUSE CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT OKAY
Line_3409	OMNIVORES ONLY EAT BERRIES AND AND MEAT
Line_3410	AND BERRIES
Line_3411	THEY EAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVEN CAR
Line_3412	DECOMPOSER EATS ALL THE STUFF AROUND IT
Line_3413	DECOMPOSERS EAT RAW THINGS ON LAND
Line_3414	ANIMALS CONSUMER OKAY
Line_3415	AN OMNIVORE
Line_3416	A CARNIVORE
Line_3417	EARTH WORMS ARE YOU IDIOT
Line_3418	THAT THEY LIKE THAT ENVIRONMENT
Line_3419	THEY WILL DIG HOLES IN IT AND EAT THE FOOD INSIDE THE DIRT
Line_3420	IT CREATES ALL THE THAT HAS THINGS IN THE WORLD
Line_3421	DOING WELL HOW HOW ARE YOU
Line_3422	IT LOOKS LIKE WHOLE BUNCH OF WORMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
Line_3423	ALL OF THE PLANTS IN THE GROUND LIKE THE ROOTS
Line_3424	A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS
Line_3425	ALL THE LIVING CELLS AND OTHER PLANTS
Line_3426	WHEN I CLICK ON THE LEG I NOTICED A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE BUGS INSIDE OF
Line_3427	MUSCLE CELLS ARE THE MOST PART OF THE BODY SO THAT YOU COULD RUN OR WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
Line_3428	THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THEM
Line_3429	I SEE THE BRAINS NEURONS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE PERSON SMARTER
Line_3430	THE BRAIN CELLS WITH THE NEURONS COMING OUT OF HIM
Line_3431	THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF THEM CALLED NEUMRONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW A NEW NEUMRON COMES OUT
Line_3432	I SEE SOME SORT OF DESIGN BUT I CAN TELL WHAT IT IS
Line_3433	IMPORTANT TO THESE IS A KIND OF SKIN CELLS IS HOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HEALTHY HEARTS
Line_3434	THAT THEY HOLD THE SKIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
Line_3435	THEY ARE MADE OF FLESH AND THAT THE SKIN CELLS CONNECT TO
Line_3436	YES BECAUSE OF THE ANIMALS THE MAMMOTH MAMMALS ALL HAVE THE SAME SKIN CELLS
Line_3437	I NOTICED A BUNCH OF LITTLE CELLS IN THE YEAST AND IN THE SKIN CELLS
Line_3438	I THINK THIS CAN BE TRYING TO SHOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PART OF CELLS THAT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS HAVE
Line_3439	I SEE SOME SORT OF WEIRD LITTLE CELL AND IN THE PLANT CELL THAT'S MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
Line_3440	THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ME THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS EACH ANIMAL HAD
Line_3441	WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT HUMANS AND CELLS IS ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
Line_3442	THAT THERE'S A BLANK SCREEN IN FRONT OF ME
Line_3443	ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM ON A HUMAN
Line_3444	DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS HELP YOUR FOOD BREAK DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR BLOOD
Line_3445	IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
Line_3446	ESOPHAGUS LEADS THE FOODS INTO THE STOMACH
Line_3447	THE LIQUID ACID
Line_3448	THEY ARE THE BIGGEST PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3449	THE LARGE INTESTINES IS FOR THE WASTE REMOVAL AND THE SMALL INTESTINES IS FOR THE FOOD TO GO DOWN
Line_3450	THEY DIGEST FOOD TO GO INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM
Line_3451	ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL OF IT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3452	THESE ARE ALL THE YEAST CELL
Line_3453	OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL CELLS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_3454	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING CELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3455	ALL OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR CELLS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINNATE PALMATE AND ANOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
Line_3459	THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON THEM LIKE THE PALMATE HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
Line_3460	THEIR PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIDES OF THE LEAF
Line_3461	HOW SOME LEAVES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS
Line_3462	PALMATE PALMATE AND PARALLEL
Line_3463	THAT IT'S A PALMATE
Line_3464	TO HOLD THE LEAF TOGETHER
Line_3465	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3466	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3467	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3468	I THINK THE VASCULAR SYSTEM LABELS ALL OF THE THINGS
Line_3469	ONE TUBE GOES UP THE OTHER TUBE GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LEAVES
Line_3471	WHAT DOES WHAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_3473	GOOD
Line_3474	IT'S UHM ALL THE PLANETS ARE ORBITING OUR SUN
Line_3475	BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT IS MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING US THE SUN AND THE SOLAR FLARE
Line_3476	SO FOR HOW LIKE
Line_3477	TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND ALSO THE INNER PLANETS
Line_3478	THAT INNER PLANETS ARE SUPER SMALL
Line_3479	THE EARTH ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVITY WE WOULD JUST SHOOT IN A
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_3481	EARTH LUGGAGE COMPUTERS CARS UM THE HUMAN BODY AND THE UNIVERSE
Line_3482	IT HELP IT SAYS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN A SYSTEM
Line_3483	IS A SYSTEM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WHEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH INVOLVING THE SYSTEM
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY HIGHLIGHT
Line_3487	IT IS AN EARTH IT IS THE EARTH AND THAT IS A SYSTEM
Line_3488	THE INTERACTING PARTS IN IN IT
Line_3489	SO I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THINGS
Line_3490	THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE AN OCEAN HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES
Line_3492	UM THERE ARE ECOSYSTEMS AND UM I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFRICA IT BROUGHT UP DESERT
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND ICE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	WEBS MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THEM
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY ARE A A DECOMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS OR BACTERIA
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE
Line_3502	CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS
Line_3503	A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATHE AND EAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHES IN C TWO O WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND THEY BREATHE OUT AIR WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE IN
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_3506	CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASK
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
Line_3509	IT IS A FOOD CHAIN OF MANY DIFFERENT
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS SOME OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	A HERBIVORE ONLY EATS PLANTS
Line_3512	THINK THAT AN OMNIVORE MEANS YOU EAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3513	I THINK A DECOMPOSER IS
Line_3514	DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE EARTH THAT HELP IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS A A COMPOSER
Line_3517	A CARNIVORE
Line_3518	IT IS A HERBIVORE
Line_3519	IS A DECOMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE EARTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THEY'LL DEAD LEAVES AND THE NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOST
Line_3521	WORMS DECOMPOSE IT AND MAKE IT COMPOST
Line_3522	IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE OF A BIG SYSTEM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BUG THE BIRD THE HAWK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3531	A DECOMPOSER EATS DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3533	THERE WE GO THE MUSHROOMS
Line_3534	YEAH A CONSUMER
Line_3535	A DECOMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT
Line_3537	BEING AN HERBIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NO PLANT
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NEITHER A HERBIVORE A CARNIVORE NOR A OMNIVORE
Line_3541	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOX IS A CARNIVORE
Line_3544	THEY ARE WORMS THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDENS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDENS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT A I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY SO YOU TELL ME
Line_3550	YEAST IS A FUNGUS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN ITS DORMANT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SUNLIGHT WATER AND SOIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TOO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SUNLIGHT AND THE PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NUTRIENTS TO SURVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	CAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Line_3561	TOO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
Line_3562	PLANTS NEED SUN TO SURVIVE AND THIS AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
Line_3563	THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO DIE
Line_3564	THE PLANT GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEED EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SURVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIE AND WILT
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SITTING THE D IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND THE GEESE ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND IT IS BRINGING POLLEN BACK TO THE HONEY COMB
Line_3572	IT SHOWS THAT ONE BEE WANTS OTHER BEES TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS GOING TO TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DOORBELL RANG THE DOG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT IT'S IT'S MASTER
Line_3575	IT SLAPS THE MOSQUITO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE DOG THE DOORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULUS IS THAT THE DOG BARKED
Line_3577	THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND
Line_3579	THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAKES PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_3580	THERE'RE ANIMALS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN ADAPTATION
Line_3583	THE SKUNK IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DEFEND ITSELF FROM PREDATOR
Line_3585	IT'S ADAPT ONE OF ITS ADAPTATION IS ITS SHELL CAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SURVIVE FROM PREDATOR
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF ITS ADAPTATION IS ITS PATTERN ON ITS BACK AND ON ITS BODY SO IT CAN BE CAMOUFLAGED IN WITH ITS HABITAT
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEBBED FEET
Line_3589	NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS FOR THAT IT CAN FLY AWAY
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE AWAY
Line_3592	THE SNAKE HAS AN ADAPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTLE IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTLE SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMULUS
Line_3594	IT IS INVOLVING A SKUNK WHICH IS FOOD FOR THE WOLF
Line_3595	AN ADAPTATION THAT THE SKUNK HAS IS ITS SMELL THAT MAKES THE SKUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT TO SMELL THAT
Line_3596	WHAT DOES CLASSIFIED MEAN
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BIRDS ARE FLYING AND THE ONE IN THE FRONT IS THE LEADER
Line_3598	IT'S BEHAVIOR IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CATCHING THE DISC
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THEY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FRISBEE WHEN THEY
Line_3600	NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
Line_3601	IT IS A NONLEARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3602	THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3603	THIS IS A NONLEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY SO BAD
Line_3604	THE CAT FELL OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY CELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINK
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUE
Line_3609	THAT ALL THE BIG BALLS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3610	MANY BLUE CELLS THAT LOOK LIKE SKIN
Line_3611	SKIN CELLS HELP YOU BODY HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN YEAST DOES
Line_3613	THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS IN ITS BODY AND IN ITS WINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THE HUMAN'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3616	THIS IS SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTINES AND THE LUNG
Line_3617	THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET IT BACK OUT OF YOUR BODY
Line_3618	IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
Line_3619	THAT IS WHERE YOU WHERE THE FOOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTINES
Line_3620	THEY TRAVEL THE FOOD TO HELP IT GET OUT
Line_3621	IT IS A HUMAN BODY
Line_3622	THIS IS TELLING YOU PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THE
Line_3623	THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING INTO YOUR BODY AND GOING INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN GOING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
Line_3624	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATHE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3625	AIR COMES INTO THE BODY THROUGH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH
Line_3626	THERE ARE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNG
Line_3627	E BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS LUNGS
Line_3628	AIR GETS TAKEN INTO THE BODY BY WHEN YOU INHALE IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
Line_3629	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3630	GOOD HOW ARE GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3631	IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3632	THE DOG'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE HUMAN'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAME
Line_3633	THAT IS OUR HEART AND SOME OF OUR BLOOD IS GOING INTO OUR HEART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
Line_3634	I SEE O TWO H TWO O COMING GOING OUT OF THE
Line_3635	THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH IS THE CAPILLARY
Line_3636	THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH IS THE CAPILLARIES
Line_3637	I THINK THAT THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
Line_3638	BLOOD GOES THROUGH BLOOD VESSELS AND GOES INTO THE HEART AND IT GOES OUT OF THE HEART
Line_3639	I THINK THAT BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART SOME BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART AND SOME BLOOD COMES OUT OF THE HEART
Line_3640	A IS THE BLOOD VESSELS
Line_3641	C IS THE BLOOD AND IT IS THE BLOOD STREAM WHERE THE BLOOD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
Line_3642	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS HOW YOU BREATHE
Line_3643	THAT IS ABOUT THE AIR GOING INTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
Line_3644	AIR COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3645	THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3646	LUNGS AND YES IT IS IN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3647	THE DIAPHRAGM THE DIAPHRAGM
Line_3648	WELL ACTUALLY I'VE ALREADY PASSED IT
Line_3649	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3650	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3651	IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT AND IT MOVES BECAUSE ALL THE PARTS
Line_3652	IT'S YOUR BODY YOUR BODY'S A VERY BIG SYSTEM WITH SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3653	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3654	THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3655	WE HAVE UM INTERACTING PARTS AND SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR BODY
Line_3656	SMALLER SYSTEMS SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3657	HAS ISLANDS OCEANS AND LIVING THINGS IT HAS BIOSPHERE ATMOSPHERE AND OTHER SMALLER SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3658	THEY IT HAS A BIOSPHERE AND
Line_3659	A LOT WAIT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE I THINK
Line_3660	LIVING THINGS
Line_3661	IT HAS CREATURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
Line_3662	THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
Line_3663	GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
Line_3664	FOOD WEBS
Line_3665	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN DECOMPOSERS DECOMPOSE THE THE CONSUMERS
Line_3666	BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_3667	THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
Line_3668	BY EATING EACH OTHER OR THE PRODUCERS
Line_3669	THE HARE THE SNAKE THE HAWK AND THE BIRD THE BEETLE AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3670	WHEN THE CONSUMERS DIE THEY DECOMPOSE THEIR BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF NUTRIENTS
Line_3671	THE DEAD BODIES AND TRESS AND STUFF OF DEAD ANIMALS AND PLANTS
Line_3672	THE BACTERIA AND THE MUSHROOMS ARE FUNGI
Line_3673	A BERRY OR TYPE OF PLANT
Line_3674	FUNGI OR MUSHROOMS
Line_3675	A MUSHROOM OR FUNGI
Line_3676	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3677	CONSUMER OR HUMAN
Line_3678	CARNIVORES AND OMNIVORES AND HERBIVORES
Line_3679	CARNIVORES EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAT
Line_3680	THEY EAT PLANTS AND ONLY PLANTS
Line_3681	HERBIVORES EAT ONLY PLANTS
Line_3682	A HERBIVORE
Line_3683	TO ONLY EAT PLANTS THEY EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT WAIT WHAT
Line_3684	A OMNIVORE
Line_3685	AN OMNIVORE
Line_3686	TO EAT ONLY DEAD THINGS
Line_3687	ONLY EAT THEY EAT ONLY DECOMPOSED STUFF OR DEAD STUFF
Line_3688	A A CARNIVORE
Line_3689	IT'S A DECOMPOSER THEY'RE WORMS THEY EAT ONLY DEAD STUFF
Line_3690	A DECOMPOSER
Line_3691	THEY PRODUCE HEALTHY STUFF FOR PLANTS OR IS THAT EARTH WORMS
Line_3692	MORE FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS BUT WE ALSO STUDIED OMNIVORES CARNIVORES AND HERBIVORES
Line_3693	YEAST ANIMAL CRACKERS WHICH HAVE SUGAR AND FLOUR AND WATER
Line_3694	I THINK IT'S ABOUT YEAST AND GETTING ITS NUTRIENTS
Line_3695	VERY VERY MUCH SO
Line_3696	WELL THE A PLANT ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
Line_3697	THE PLANT ALSO NEEDS SUNLIGHT
Line_3698	PLANTS DON'T NEED HAMBURGERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD BUT THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD BY USING SUGAR SUNLIGHT AND WATER VAPOR
Line_3699	FROM FOOD BUT I DID'T REALLY MENTION FOOD CAUSE IT PRODUCES IT'S OWN
Line_3700	LOOKS LIKE CELLS
Line_3701	WE DID A YEAST EXPERIMENT
Line_3702	LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
Line_3703	LOOKS LIKE A FACTORY
Line_3704	I DO NOT KNOW I FORGOT
Line_3705	THEY'RE VERY COOL THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS OF A MUSCLE AND THERE'S LITTLE DOTS IN BETWEEN
Line_3706	THEY LOOK LIKE NERVES
Line_3707	NORMAL CELLS BLOOD CELLS
Line_3708	THEY'RE PART OF OUR SKIN
Line_3709	THEY'RE MADE OF CELLS EVERYTHING'S MADE OUT OF CELLS EVERY LIVING THING'S MADE
Line_3710	WE HAVE A LOT MORE CELLS THAN YEAST
Line_3711	HUMAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST ONE CELLED ORGANISMS LIKE YEAST
Line_3712	A BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT OF CELLS
Line_3713	I FORGOT LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_3714	THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3715	WE BOTH HAVE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS
Line_3716	OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3717	BREAKING DOWN FOOD GIVING OUR BODIES ENERGY
Line_3718	THE MOUTH BREAKS DOWN THE FOOD
Line_3719	THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
Line_3720	BRINGS FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH USING MUSCLES
Line_3721	IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
Line_3722	TO BREAK DOWN FOOD AND YEAH
Line_3723	THE INTESTINES ABSORB ALL THE NUTRIENTS AND WATER FOR IT TO USE FOR OUR BODY
Line_3724	IT GIVES OUT WASTE WHICH IS DISGUSTING
Line_3725	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES PLANTS
Line_3726	IT'S A PALMATE
Line_3727	IT'S A PALERMITE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I KNOW IT STARTS WITH A P I THINK
Line_3728	GETTING FOOD FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND MAKING FOOD
Line_3729	FEEDS PLANT AND STUFF
Line_3730	THAT'S A BAG AROUND A LEAVE THAT SHOWS WATER VAPOR COMING OFF OF THE LEAF WHICH IS VERY USEFUL
Line_3731	I FORGOT
Line_3732	OXYGEN WHICH HELPS OUR BODY WELL NOT HELPS MAKES OUR BODY LIVE
Line_3733	THEY BOTH HAVE HEARTS AND VEINS
Line_3734	UHM THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3735	THAT THE HEART LIKE ONE SIDE OF THE HEART PUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BODY THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMPS TO THE LUNGS AND BACK
Line_3736	OXYGEN UHM FOOD WELL NUTRIENTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONE
Line_3737	BLUE ARE CELLS
Line_3738	UHM THE SAME THING
Line_3739	UHM LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
Line_3740	BLOOD VESSELS THE HEART AND BLOOD
Line_3741	BLOOD'S GOING IN AND OUT
Line_3742	THEY'RE WELL PRETTY MUCH THE THE VEIN'S DELIVERY SYSTEM THE HEART'S DELIVERY SYSTEM THEN THE VEINS ARE THE ROADS
Line_3743	GIVE BLOOD TO THE HEART AND TAKE IT AWAY
Line_3744	PRETTY MUCH THE HIGHWAYS FOR BLOOD AND THEY'RE CALLED VEINS AND ARTERY
Line_3745	UHM THE PUMP
Line_3746	C UHM DOES WELL HOLDS THE BLOOD
Line_3747	IT'S THE IT'S THE LUNGS THAT PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT IT'S THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND YEAH
Line_3748	THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3749	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING OXYGEN INTO YOUR BODY AND CARBON DIOXIDE OUT
Line_3750	AIR GOING IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OXYGEN TO YOUR CELLS AND GETTING CARBON DIOXIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES AND IT FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE LUNGS
Line_3753	THEY'RE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF INTO THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS AND THEY PRETTY MUCH HOLD THE AIR SACK
Line_3754	CELLS ARE DROPPING OFF CARBON DIOXIDE AND PICKING UP OXYGEN
Line_3755	UHM
Line_3756	H THE AIR SACKS OR ALVEOLI
Line_3757	GRAMS THE UHM
Line_3758	THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE WHOLE SYSTEM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BIOSPHERE THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BIOSPHERE MAKING IT AN ENTIRE SYSTEM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SORRY I'M ON THE WRONG WEBSITE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE YEAST OR YEAST PARTICLES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE
Line_3768	MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOOD AND WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3770	SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FERTILIZER
Line_3771	DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANTS ALSO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANTS USE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO GET THE IT FROM I'M GONNA START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS YEAST OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF CELL
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY CELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG CELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE YEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE CELL THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIONS OF CELLS
Line_3779	IT'S A BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH TINY LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	CELLS AND ORGANISMS AND SYSTEMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS IN ONE SYSTEM
Line_3784	PINK MUSCLES IN IN THE LEG AND THEY'RE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSCLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSCLE CELL
Line_3786	THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS IN THE BRAIN ORGANISM
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AND THE YEAST IS JUST MADE UP OF ONE CELL
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OUR LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLIES NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF CELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SYSTEMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISMS AND SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR BODIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOOD THROUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONT IN THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THE FOOD
Line_3793	TO DIGEST THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FOOD AS ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M VERY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH BUT HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW OR WHEAT WHEAT NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DIDN'T BREATHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIE
Line_3797	I THINK GRAMS THE DIAGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	H THE ALVEOLI AND YEAH THE ALVEOLI H
Line_3799	GOOD HELLO MISS LADY HOW ARE YOU
Line_3800	I THINK IT'S IN THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN'S BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS C O TWO AND O TWO
Line_3802	A AND B THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3803	H
Line_3804	I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE TALKED TO YOU EARLIER
Line_3806	SYSTEMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I THINK THAT IS A HEART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VEINS CONNECT INTO THE HEART
Line_3809	H TWO O AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD CELLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH ARE THE VEINS AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
Line_3811	THAT THE BLUE PART IS CELL ARE CELLS AND THE RED PART IS CAPILLARY
Line_3812	IT'S LETTING IN BLOOD AND THEN PUSHING OUT BLOOD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLOOD AROUND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BODY
Line_3814	BLOOD VESSELS THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOOD AROUND
Line_3815	THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASES SO THAT WE CAN SURVIVE
Line_3819	LUNG THE LUNGS DEFINITELY THE LUNGS
Line_3820	F THE LUNGS
Line_3821	THROUGH A AND B THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TRACHEA
Line_3823	THE RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE
Line_3824	LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORRIED WHEN HE SAW THE JUICE SPILLING OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT YOU LOOK QUITE FAT MAN
Line_3826	UHM I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SYSTEMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTOISES SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WEBBED FEET
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN RIP OPEN HIS PREY
Line_3831	ITS TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FART AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF GEESE ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOOSE BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIOR
Line_3833	UHM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WEATHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW A FRISBEE FOR IT
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURT SO THEY JUST WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THEY'RE SPECIAL REFLEXES
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT HAS SYSTEMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AND INTERACTING OF MOVING PARTS TOGETHER MAKING A CAR
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF PARTS THAT MOVE AND WORK TOGETHER
Line_3843	IS BECAUSE IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM
Line_3844	THE HEART AND THE EYES
Line_3845	THERE IS MOVING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SYSTEM
Line_3846	YEAH TO MOVE AND TO WORK TOGETHER
Line_3847	SEE THIS I SEE THIS MOUNTAIN LOOKING THING AND IT HAS FOUR SYSTEMS
Line_3848	ARE FOUR
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3850	ECOSYSTEM LIKE
Line_3851	THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ANIMALS AND THE ANIMALS ARE EATING
Line_3852	THE PATH THAT ANIMALS PROCESS FOOD THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ARE PRODUCING A SUBSYSTEM OF THE EARTH
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH SYSTEMS
Line_3855	IS A SYSTEM WITH INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3856	IT IS A BUNCH OF INTERACTING PARTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE WE'RE INTERACTING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3858	CAUSE IT HAS BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE
Line_3859	I THINK THAT THESE ARE SYSTEMS
Line_3860	A SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT'S A BIG INTERACTING PART MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SYSTEM
Line_3862	GOOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS UM
Line_3866	IT'S BODY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3868	A HEART A KIDNEY AND A
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S UM A BIGGER PART OF A A SUB SUBSYSTEM
Line_3870	THERE ARE
Line_3871	BIOSPHERE IS UM ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	AN ECOSYSTEM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S UM LAND AND OCEAN
Line_3874	THE ARROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE EAT LIKE OR WHAT AND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I THINK THAT WARM PLACES WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER HAS OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE SURFACE
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE SURFACE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO SHRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPOR OR TINY DROPLETS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW SURFACE AREA AFFECTS HOW MUCH WATER IN A CUP EVAPORATES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED ME QUITE YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PUDDLES EVAPORATE QUITE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SOIL AND ROCKS OR GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER ON THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GAS STATE
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP WHERE YOU SEE WATER DROPLETS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THAT THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THAN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITTING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER WHEEL TO HELP US LIFT A PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	MARNIE YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	THAT'S OKAY MARNIE
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WHEEL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNIE BYE SEE YOU NEXT YEAR OR LATER THIS YEAR
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WERE AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	THEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SCALE AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_3907	THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BASK THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCALE
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIAL THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUPS TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT
Line_3911	IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SI THE EXACT WAY ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED AT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORTA GUESSED
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WELL BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST WANT US TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE I WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROW HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK AND WHAT YEAH CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
Line_3922	UH YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHING'S BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND IT'S CUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR HE WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTHWISE IT COULDN'T GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SURE EXCEPT SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE SCALE YEAH THE SCALE YEAH
Line_3927	NO DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE COUNT HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOUR UM AND THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WEIGHS THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE E LITTLE
Line_3930	MMM NO METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	N MMM NO NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	OKAY THIS ONE OH SORRY
Line_3933	THAT WOULD BE FIVE PAPER CLIPS
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLASTIC WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	OH SORRY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM CAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_3939	ONE GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I E WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT I THI I FIGURED OUT THAT THEY WEREN'T ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY BLANK AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_3943	OKAY OKAY
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DESKS WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
Line_3946	UM WE BASICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DESKS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRETTY USEFUL BUT THEY CAN'T BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING CAUSE
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NO
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T COLOR EM IN YET NO
Line_3952	UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDENT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HAD ONE
Line_3953	UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO NOT REALLY
Line_3955	OH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ANYTHING
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER US USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH
Line_3958	UH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	CAN I TAKE THESE OFF OKAY
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR EM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH JUST THIRTY EIGHT PACES WHEN I WALKED OVER THERE YEAH
Line_3962	YEAH NO WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT UM I HAVE NO CLUE NO IDEA NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW NO
Line_3965	TWENTY EIGHT METERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO CLUE MAYBE JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE OFFICE SO YEAH
Line_3967	OKAY YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBE CAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE UH
Line_3969	I HAVE NO CLUE I'M SAYING THAT TO MOST QUESTIONS BUT YEAH
Line_3970	OKAY GOOD I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS
Line_3971	IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
Line_3972	UM YES WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY GOT A LOT BETTER YEAH
Line_3973	UM I'VE LEARNED THAT UH
Line_3974	YEAH REPEATING THINGS IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONCE AND I'VE HEARD THAT ON SHOWS ALWAYS MEASURE TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES ON YEAH
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WORD FOR GUESS
Line_3977	A GRAM'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS A PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	AND BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO MILLIGRAMS AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT IT WAS MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A A GRAM IS JUST ABOUT AS MUCH AS A PAPER CLIP
Line_3980	JUST WEIGHS AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	MMM YEAH THOUSANDS
Line_3982	MILLIGRAM IS A S THOUSANDTH OF A GRAM WITH A THOUSANDTH OF A GRAM
Line_3983	MMM EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BE ONE LINE
Line_3984	TH THE TH THE THING THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM YOU S THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRAIGHT IT WOULDN'T BE SORTA SLANTED
Line_3986	OKAY BUT I WANNA SEE THE INTERACTIVE CHIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHED MORE
Line_3988	WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM THREE ACTUALLY THIRTY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED BEANS EQUALS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE NET ONE OF THE BEANS EQUALS A GRAM
Line_3992	THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
Line_3994	A HUNDRED GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM MMM LET'S SEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER UM ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TO MORE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT WAS THE INTERACTIVE TIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANNA SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSES
Line_4000	AND WE DID WEIGH IT WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	HI LOOK THAT THING IS GOING LOOK THAT THING GOES
Line_4002	MMM READING WRITING AND MATH MAINLY
Line_4003	OKAY OH THIS IS RED
Line_4004	MMM OH YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DESK WITH STRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING ON MINE A BIT
Line_4006	BY TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE DESKS WERE THREE BY TWO BUT MINE WAS TWO AND NINE TENTHS BY TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DESK SEEMED SHORTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
Line_4008	BY TO YEAH BECAUSE TO BE A NINE TENTH IS AL I MEAN TWO AND NINE TENTHS IS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE POINT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	MMM HMM OKAY
Line_4011	NO OH YEAH WE DID WE WE DID
Line_4012	UM IT'S A METER TAPE AND YOU WRITE YOUR NAME THERE
Line_4013	NO THE IT UH IT ISN'T COLORED AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I I HAVE NO IDEA WE MIGHT COLOR IT SOMETIME
Line_4015	THOSE THINGS MARKS CENTIMETERS OKAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDREDTH OF A METER IT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER GOING ALL THE WAY
Line_4017	NO WE JUST START WE JUST STARTED CUTTING IT OUT AND GLUED IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	ONE TEN MILLIMETER EQUALS ONE TEENY CENTIMETER
Line_4019	THAT'S THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTIMETER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN OF THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHAT A SCALE ONE MILLIMETER
Line_4022	OKAY
Line_4023	I WANNA SEE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I DON'T WANNA GET
Line_4024	OKAY HEY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT HMM
Line_4025	I KNOW BUT WHAT'S F NUMBER FOUR IT SAID IT WAS
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LITERS NOW CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S S COMPARE VIALS YEAH THAT'S LIKE WHAT OURS WERE
Line_4029	UM A L A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUAL TO ONE LITER AND A
Line_4030	I'M NOT I I KNOW IT NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT HEY WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	A LOT MEDIUM LOT THERE'S SUCH THING AS A KILOLITER I THINK
Line_4032	A LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	YEAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UM YOU COULD S MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM S THOUSANDTH
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GRAM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLILITER PROBABLY EQUALS A A MILLIMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD FIND THE CUP THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT AND YOU WOULD POUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	LE LE I WANNA DO GRADUATED C
Line_4040	YEAH YOU COULD LOSE THOSE THINGS OOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	HEY I THINK THIS IS ON BACKWARDS THAT'S WHY IT'S KEEPS ON FALLING OFF
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET THE TEACHER HAS ONLY SHOWN US WE DID THE VIAL THING AND THEN THE TEACHER ALSO SHOWED US BUT
Line_4046	HEY CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU I CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE IN THE I'M TH THE THING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT W OF VIALS AND SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S TH A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LITER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE V VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WIDTH OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	MMM THE WHAT'D YOU SAY PAYING ATTENTION I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT OF THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT JUST IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH HEIGHT WITH DEBT AND LENGTH
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE SORRY NO NOT THAT ONE W DID WE DO THIS ONE
Line_4056	MMM THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSANDTH OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OF IT
Line_4057	WHAT OH TEN
Line_4058	TH UM PROBABLY THE EITHER THE THIS ONE OR THOSE
Line_4059	WHAT WHAT WHAT I W UM THE PROBABLY THE HUNDREDS
Line_4060	MMM WHAT'S UNIT YEAH UM PROBABLY EITHER THE ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	MMM WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SAY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
Line_4062	UM PROB PROBABLY MILLILITERS
Line_4063	OH BUT I WANNA SEE THE FIRST I WANNA DON'T FORGET THE A
Line_4064	AND WE WEREN'T USING VIALS WE L USED VIALS A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH MMM WELL NOT WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
Line_4066	MMM NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE A B LINE A C LINE A D LINE
Line_4067	UH THE SYRINGE IS A IS A THING THAT SORTA SUCKS UP WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IS IN THERE THAT YOU SUCKED UP
Line_4068	WELL BY THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH WITH NO
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BREAK
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VIALS WERE DIFFERENT YEAH S MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTY MOST OF ARE GRADUATED CYLINDERS BUT THOSE ONES HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER
Line_4074	UM HOW MANY OH THAT'S A THOUSAND IN THAT BIG THING IN ONE LITER
Line_4075	WHAT WAS THE SODA CAN THE INTERACTIVE SODA CAN I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES AW
Line_4076	NO BUT WHOA A HUNDRED THAT LOOKS NE EQUALS
Line_4077	TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADUATED CYLINDERS EQUAL WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT CALLED IS WHAT I'M WONDERING OH A TRAY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT'S ONE'S WIDE IT'S TOO FLAT AND THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL M L STANDS STANDS FOR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF IT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_4082	WE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER'S LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LINED UP TO IS THE ONE THAT YOU'RE
Line_4083	YEAH
Line_4084	UM UM HMM NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WANNA LOOK AT THE THAT'S THE ONLY INTERACTIVE THING THOUGH
Line_4086	IT'S THE ONLY INTERACTIVE ONE
Line_4087	IT'S INTERACTIVE OR IN SODA LOOK SEE IT SAYS ORANGE SODA
Line_4088	UH-HUH BUT I WANNA VIDEOTAPE MY TONSILS
Line_4089	MMM HMM MMM BALANCE
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WENT UP WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
Line_4091	MMM HMM Y YEAH
Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND SAID TO A CARPENTER
Line_4093	I WANT I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED AT A GROCERY STORE AND SAID YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4095	OF APPLES PROBABLY A HE YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE USED SMALL AND HE COULDA USED BIG
Line_4096	POUNDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	N SO IT SAY ONE POUND IT W YOU WANTED ONE POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED IT ON THE UM UNIT ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIPS THEN
Line_4100	AND PLASTIC CHIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DIDN'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	GOOD TO USE FOR MEASURE I MEAN WEIGHT
Line_4102	E IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE YOU WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT'VE USED DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	YEAH ONE WOULD BE SMALLER AND ONE WOULD BE S HUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND GROUP A WOULD BE SU
Line_4107	WITH A RULER OR TAPE MEASURE
Line_4108	MOST RULE MOST RULERS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAME LENGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A RULER WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURER BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES YOU WOULDN'T USE M ME METERS
Line_4112	I KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED A HUNDREDTH OF A CENTIMETER
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_4114	MY DAD MEASURED UM BUILDS BUILDINGS SO HE USES A LOT OF THIS STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A S A KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE ZERO ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TIL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WA UH WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THE ARD BECAUSE THE TAPE
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD'VE UM MARKED THE SPOT
Line_4120	OKAY THAT IT WAS TEN S CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_4121	UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURE IT MEASURES WHAT IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPUTERS DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOORS ARE UM CAN BE
Line_4126	WIDER THAN TABLE THAN TABLES ARE HIGH
Line_4127	UM RULERS
Line_4128	WELL IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KINDA WOBBLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE IT THE CORRECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERS SO THERE'S ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	MILLIMETERS CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	I COULD
Line_4135	YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE'S TEN UM MILLIMETERS IN A CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4138	NO NOT REALLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPONGES SPONGES THEY SOAK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEAN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS ARE MEASURING TOOLS
Line_4141	IN THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURE IT OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNTIL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED
Line_4143	SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN IT'S LIKE THIS AND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRETTY BALANCED RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COUNT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPONGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPONGE YOU WEIGH IT UNTIL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW H THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MESSY
Line_4147	UM UH HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT A DRY SPONGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS IN ONE BY ONE AGAIN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THUNK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TOO IF IT'S LIKE AN HEAVY ITEM YOU CAN GO BY FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TOO HEAVY WHEN YOU PUT IN THE N ANOTHER FIVE YOU WOULD TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOUR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	UM THE DRY SPONGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4153	UM THE
Line_4154	HE LIGHT VERY LIGHT
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WAIT TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	AND THE AND THE DRY SPONGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	NO IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE A ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UNEVENLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER S THE BIG SPONGE WOULD HOLD MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY I DON'T KNOW
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GONNA BE VERY BIG WET IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND SOAKED IT'S GONNA BE GIGANTIC
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANNA GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO IDEA REALLY I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4166	THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN AN ORANGE
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAY BE TOO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH IT MAY BE MORE THAN ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4169	MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSAL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	I THINK THERE'S THESE THINGS CALLED MILLIGRAMS I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THEY'RE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILOGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WE USE METER IS LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LENGTH FROM
Line_4175	TEXAS FROM HERE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS AMAZING YEAH
Line_4177	DRY SPONGE
Line_4178	AB AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESSING
Line_4179	NO NOT REALLY YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
Line_4180	HUNDRED THOUSAND WOW
Line_4181	TESTING TESTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	MMM I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WELL HMM
Line_4185	LEVEL MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BAR IS LINED UP WITH THIS THINGIE
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMPTY WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	MMM HMM NOPE PUT ANOTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE DEFINITELY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IN IT
Line_4190	UM IT THE F THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED INTO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER IN THE SPONGE
Line_4192	UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCKETS
Line_4193	I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	THE KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBE LAPTOP COMPUTER A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WAIT THAT'S OUNCES SIXTEEN OUNCES IS A POUND
Line_4198	THEN MY DAD FLEW ME HOME HE HA HE USED TO HAVE A JOB IN CALIFORNIA
Line_4199	UM WELL THEN WE HAD THE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED
Line_4200	YEAH IT'S IT SAID LIKE FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY UP TO FIFTY PRETTY W
Line_4201	UM IT WASN'T THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY BUT STILL IT WAS THE BEST YOU COULD GET WITH SCHOOL STUFF
Line_4202	UM USING SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFIC LIKE UM
Line_4203	NO WE WE HAD TWENTY FIVE IN OUR GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED IN THE CONTAINER
Line_4204	UM WELL
Line_4205	WELL I CAN'T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE
Line_4206	WELL YEAH WHAT YOU SAID WAS WHAT HAPPENED I JUST CAN'T REPEAT IT ALL
Line_4207	THIS UM OUR CONTAINER DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ONE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4208	THE SAME YEAH EQUAL THAT'S MMM HMM
Line_4209	MMM HMM IT HAS TO BE ZERO YEAH
Line_4210	UM PRETTY MUCH NO
Line_4211	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAMS IS THAT I'D SAY HMM
Line_4212	YEAH WE DID IT WITH PAPER CLIPS I REMEMBER OKAY
Line_4213	SO WHICH ONE'S
Line_4214	WHY DO WE DO IT WHY
Line_4215	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LET'S SEE HMM
Line_4216	IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COULD BECAUSE UM LET'S SEE SO IT COULD
Line_4217	UM IT WAS IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE SOME WERE BIG AND SOME WERE SMALL
Line_4218	UM THE GRAMS TH THE GRAMS WORKED BETTER
Line_4219	BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME KIND OF GRAMS
Line_4220	CENTIME GRAMS I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT GRAMS ARE
Line_4221	OH A GRAM IS UM HEAVIER
Line_4222	HMM MMM I DON'T REALLY KNOW IT'S YEAH A STANDARD
Line_4223	HMM LET'S SEE
Line_4224	YEAH UM IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME KIND OF OBJECTS SAME SIZE
Line_4225	UM LIKE HMM LET'S SEE
Line_4226	UM LET'S SEE
Line_4227	WE DID LOTS OF STUFF LIKE UH
Line_4228	WITH UM WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WITH UM UM
Line_4229	YEAH TO ONE GRAM AND UM
Line_4230	THE YEAH YEAH
Line_4231	UM IT UM
Line_4232	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT IT WAS A STAN AND UM
Line_4233	UM EQUAL UM THEY HAVE TO BE THE SAME SIZE
Line_4234	UM BECAUSE UM IT'S IT'S IT'S STRAIGHT AND THE FULCRUM IS IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_4235	UM WATER BOTTLES UM WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE LIKE
Line_4236	UM WATER BOTTLES MMM
Line_4237	UM IT'S SOMETHING THAT WEIGHS THAT WEIGHS LIKE
Line_4238	LIKE WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THING OR LESS
Line_4239	UM THAT SOME THAT SOME WERE SMALLER AND SOME WERE BIGGER SO S SO SOME PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4240	UM MY GROUP HAD UM IT WAS TWELVE I THINK YEAH TWELVE
Line_4241	UM LET'S SEE
Line_4242	IT WOULD BE IT WOULD JUST FALL DOWN YEAH
Line_4243	IT DOES BUT UM HMM
Line_4244	WHOA OH YEAH
Line_4245	FIFTY S SIXTY A HU A HUNDRED
Line_4246	NO WE USED UM A POWDER I THINK
Line_4247	UM THAT IS UM A KILOGRAM ACTUALLY THAT IS ABOUT A HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_4248	NO YEAH
Line_4249	UM YOU
Line_4250	GRADUATED CYLINDER AND SOMETHING THAT SOAKS UP WATER IT'S CALLED A SYRINGE YEAH SYRINGE WE USED IT SO
Line_4251	UM IT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND PRETTY MUCH YEAH IT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_4252	UM YEAH WE WERE LOOKING FOR FOR UM THE VOLUME AS I TOLD YOU BUT UM WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING
Line_4253	YEAH CAPACITY THE CAPACITY IS WHEN UM I KNOW WHAT CAPACITY MEANS IT IS WHEN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY UP BUT
Line_4254	OH IS IT OH YEAH S
Line_4255	WELL UM SODA CANS AREN'T FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_4256	CAPACITY THE VOLUME BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY FILLED TO THE TOP
Line_4257	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WE DID A TALK ABOUT THAT
Line_4258	MMM NO
Line_4259	NO WE PUT EM IN THE SODA CAN AND THEN WE MEASURED IT
Line_4260	THEN WE POURED IT IN INTO THE INTO THE SODA CAN
Line_4261	IN IN THE SODA CAN
Line_4262	MILLILITERS OR LET'S SEE
Line_4263	WELL A LITER IS BIGGER THAN A MILLILITER WELL LET'S SEE A MILLILITER IS
Line_4264	DIDN'T TA WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT BUT WE ONLY T
Line_4265	A LITER IS UM TWO A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4266	UM WE USED GRAMS
Line_4267	HMM LET'S SEE I DON'T REALLY KNOW LIKE MMM
Line_4268	HMM I DON'T THINK SO
Line_4269	UM YO
Line_4270	NO BECAUSE UM YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER YOU PUT IN THERE
Line_4271	OH YEAH YEAH
Line_4272	UM LET'S SEE
Line_4273	LET'S SEE UM
Line_4274	UM LET'S SEE
Line_4275	YEP UH-HUH
Line_4276	SORTA LIKE MATH AND UM
Line_4277	OH YEAH
Line_4278	UM WE MEASURED EACH OTHER WITH METERS AND ST S
Line_4279	YEAH UH-HUH
Line_4280	YEAH IT STARTED WITH THE SMALLEST AND IT WENT TO THE HIGHEST N MMM IT WORKED
Line_4281	THEN WE MEASURED THE ROOM AND WITH SOME MEDIUM SIZED PACE
Line_4282	NO ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED WE MEASURED FROM OUR ROOM ALL THE WAY TO THE OFFICE
Line_4283	I LEARNED THAT WE WERE SORT OF EVERYBODY'S JUST SORT OF IN BETWEEN ONE FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED
Line_4284	I DON'T KNOW BUT I SE UH I FORGOT WHAT I WROTE ABOUT THAT
Line_4285	WE DON'T KNOW WE ALL MEASURED WITH THE SAME MEDIUM SIZED PACE
Line_4286	NO BUT WE HAD A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH WAS A MEDIUM SIZED PACE
Line_4287	I WANNA LOOK AT MORE STUFF BUT
Line_4288	WHAT IS
Line_4289	ONE OKAY SO WHAT ELSE IS IS THERE
Line_4290	I LI I L I LIKE LOOKING AT THE MILLIMETERS
Line_4291	OH I WANT TO DO THE MORE ADVANCED I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METER STICK I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METER STICK
Line_4292	UH IT'S THREE METERS LONG BUT ACTUALLY I
Line_4293	MMM TEN WHAT'S METER METER N AWW NO
Line_4294	I KNOW BUT THIS BUT BUT MY ARM SPAN WAS WAS WAS ACTUALLY LONGER THAN HOW TALL I WAS AND IT WAS MORE THAN A METER
Line_4295	MMM NOT NOT NOT USUALLY SOME OF EM
Line_4296	A SH I WANNA LOOK AT THE GROUP STRAWS UH GROUP STRAWS
Line_4297	THAT THAT THE STRAWS ARE NOT GOOD
Line_4298	YEAH BUT I WANNA GO TO MORE STUFF ON A S AND I WANT THE
Line_4299	PACES IS WHAT WE DID METER TAPE IT MOVES
Line_4300	I WANNA SEE THE OTHER METER STICK
Line_4301	METER STICK METER STICK ONE AND METER STICK TWO WHAT'S I METER S STICK
Line_4302	OKAY NOT WHAT I I WANNA LOOK AT THE THE S METER STICK
Line_4303	UH OKAY YEAH AND IT I WE KNOW THERE'S HUNDRED THOUSANDTHS OF A ME
Line_4304	ONE CENTIMETER I ALWAYS GET MIXED UP
Line_4305	TEN AND THERE'S TEN DECIMETERS AND ONE
Line_4306	THERE'S W IS THERE ANY KILOMETERS
Line_4307	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CLICK ON SCALE
Line_4308	MMM MEASURING LONG DISTANCES LIKE THE SCHOOL TO THE HOUSE
Line_4309	MAYBE I WOULD USE MILLIMETERS TO BE
Line_4310	THE WE DID THAT ONE I WANTED TO METER CHALKBOARD WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ONE YET
Line_4311	THREE THREE AND A HALF FOUR MMM HMM YES FOUR METERS
Line_4312	YEAH I WANNA VIDEOTAPE MY TONSILS AGAIN
Line_4313	VIDEOTAPING MY TONSILS TONSILS
Line_4314	NO NO WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE A WE A ALL OF OUR STRAWS ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_4315	UM WHEN W YOU'RE MOVING TO A NEW HOUSE ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER DONE THAT
Line_4316	LIKE LIKE FURNITURE
Line_4317	OH YEAH OH YEAH
Line_4318	MEASURE THE WALL OF YOUR FAMILY RO E
Line_4319	UH WE LEARNED THAT A MILE IS HOW MUCH UH HOW MUCH IS IT
Line_4320	HOW MUCH IS A MILE HOW MUCH IS A MILE
Line_4321	WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT MEASURING IS THAT UM
Line_4322	UM MEASURING HOW WE ARE HOW TALL WE ARE
Line_4323	UH I DON'T THINK TO BECAUSE A METER IS LONGER THAN YOUR HAND
Line_4324	UH DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOUR HAND'S SMALLER THAN A RULER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4325	BECAUSE IF YOU USE LIKE
Line_4326	AND WHAT ELSE
Line_4327	YOU'RE GONNA GET BETTER RESULTS BECAUSE UM
Line_4328	UH NO BECAUSE YOU ARE TALLER THAN I AM
Line_4329	OH UH WITH CENTIMETERS AND INCHES NO BECAUSE CENTIMETERS ARE SMALLER THAN INCHES
Line_4330	UH YEAH UH YEAH
Line_4331	UM WE COULD GET BETTER RESULTS
Line_4332	UM WE HAVE LIKE UH WE HAVE
Line_4333	UH WHAT IS IT AGAIN IT'S UM IT'S UH
Line_4334	WE WERE WEIGH WELL WE HAD IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING AND MEASURING
Line_4335	UH BIGGER THAN CENTIMETERS MMM HMM MMM HMM
Line_4336	UH YEAH
Line_4337	UH-HUH YEAH HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD
Line_4338	THAT UM THAT THAT THEY W THAT WHEN YOU OPEN A SODA CAN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_4339	UM WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED UH
Line_4340	I KNOW THERE'S A WORD BUT I FORGET UM
Line_4341	SYRINGES UM
Line_4342	UM IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE SOMETHING THAT SUCKS UP WATER OR SOMETHING
Line_4343	YEAH UM THEY ARE LIKE
Line_4344	UH WHAT WAS IT AGAIN WHAT WAS IT AGAIN WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
Line_4345	WELL WE USED IT SO IT COULD HELP US UM GET OUR ANSWERS RIGHT
Line_4346	UH-HUH IT'S A LITER IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_4347	UH I DON'T THINK SO
Line_4348	I THINK THAT ONE HAS THE MOST YEAH
Line_4349	YEAH WITH WITH OUR BODY WITH WITH OUR LEGS OUR ARMS HOW WHICH HOW MANY
Line_4350	MMM YEAH SOME THINGS THAT ARE HEAVY AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE LOW
Line_4351	UM KEYS HOW HEAVY THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE LITTLE AND
Line_4352	LIKE S MMM HMM YEP
Line_4353	BECAUSE LIKE IT'S BIGGER A LITTLE BIT AND IT HAS LIKE A THING INSIDE
Line_4354	BECAUSE UM DO YOU SEE THIS UM IT'S LIKE IT GOES THIS WAY IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'S THAT ONE'S LIGHTER AND THAT ONE'S HEAVIER
Line_4355	AND THIS ONE'S LOWER AND THIS ONE'S HIGHER
Line_4356	MMM IT'S MORE HEAVIER THAN THE LIGHTER
Line_4357	WE HAD THE LITTLE BLOCKS AND WE S LITTLE TINY BLOCKS AND LET'S SEE HOW MANY BLOCKS DO WE TAKE
Line_4358	LIKE ONE OF THOSE TAKE THEM
Line_4359	MMM THE LITTLE BOX NO TH YEAH THE LITTLE BOX
Line_4360	THE CORK MMM HMM
Line_4361	UM THE WOOD
Line_4362	MMM NO NONE OF THOSE OH YES SOME OF THOSE WE ONLY GOT THE LITTLE ONES YEAH
Line_4363	NO BECAUSE SOME WILL GRAB BIG ONES SOME WILL GRAB LITTLE ONES
Line_4364	MMM THEY SAW TWENTY OR THIRTY OR TEN YEAH
Line_4365	NO LIKE DIFFERENT STUFF
Line_4366	UM THE P PAPER CLIPS AND THE BOXES SAME OF THEM YEAH
Line_4367	MMM OUR OR LIKE UM WE'LL SHOW THEM AGAIN LIKE
Line_4368	UM BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT EM IN THE PAPER THEY COPY IT THE THAT AND THEN THEY CUT IT OUT AND THEN THEY SHOW THEM
Line_4369	THEY NO WE WERE WE COULD
Line_4370	UM WE GOT LIKE
Line_4371	SHOW THEM IN A JOURNAL LIKE
Line_4372	UM LIKE
Line_4373	A CHIP LIKE A WOOD CHIP AND THAT WAS LIGHT THEN LIKE A
Line_4374	UM THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE THING LIKE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'S LIKE THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4375	YEAH MMM
Line_4376	I FOR I FORGOT
Line_4377	NO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE NO WE DIDN'T NO NO
Line_4378	MMM PRETTY WELL WE YEAH
Line_4379	MMM HMM SMALL BIGGER
Line_4380	MI EVERYBODY HAD LIKE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN TWENTY DIFFERENT
Line_4381	I THINK BAD
Line_4382	UM ANY NOBODY UM MEASURES THE THE SAME UM THEY MEASURE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE
Line_4383	LIKE MMM
Line_4384	UM LIKE S SOME SOMEWHERE LIKE
Line_4385	GOOD THE LITTLE BLOCKS UM
Line_4386	NO NOT THOSE
Line_4387	AND WE MEASURED DIFFERENT LIKE UH A SHIP LIKE
Line_4388	A LITTLE COIN LIKE NOT LIKE A REAL COIN LIKE ONE OF THOSE RED COINS MMM THOSE
Line_4389	THE OTHER ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4390	UM IT'S IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4391	BECAUSE ONE IS MIDDLE AND ONE IS LIKE
Line_4392	LIKE IT'S SO LIGHT LIKE ONE IS MIDDLE AND ONE IS
Line_4393	YEAH MMM HMM LIKE S
Line_4394	UH SOME HAVE MIDDLE AND SOME HAVE YEAH
Line_4395	IT HAS DIFFERENT COLORS LIKE DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_4396	MMM WE'VE BEEN MEASURE WATER LIKE BOTTLES LIKE YEAH
Line_4397	MMM MMM HMM YEAH
Line_4398	YEAH MMM HMM
Line_4399	UM WE WRITE THE ANSWER WHAT WAS IT IN
Line_4400	MMM I DON'T REMEMBER ANYMORE
Line_4401	YEAH NOT WATER LIKE A LITTLE BIT SO SHE CAN SEE HOW HOW DIFFERENT IT IS EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER
Line_4402	YEAH SOME WERE THE SAME AND SOME WERE NOT THE SAME
Line_4403	MMM KIND OF
Line_4404	MMM MEASURING WATER BOTTLES
Line_4405	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4406	MMM HMM OUR TEACHER PUT LIKE UM WATER IN SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UH-HUH
Line_4407	THERE WAS BOYS IN MY GROUP ONLY BOYS IN THE UM GIRLS I WAS JUST THE ONLY GIRL IN THAT GROUP MMM HMM
Line_4408	AND THEN YEAH HMM
Line_4409	MMM SO THAT LIKE TO THE MMM HMM
Line_4410	YEAH MMM HMM
Line_4411	LIKE IN THE IT'S LIKE UM WET THE DESK BECAUSE WE SPILLED LOTS OF WATER
Line_4412	UM PUTTING HOW MUCH WATER DOES IT TAKE IN THE SODA CAN
Line_4413	THAT IT HAD WATER ON SO KNOW WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
Line_4414	HMM TEACHER WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WRITE THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WHAT NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINK UP YEAH
Line_4417	UM MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CANS AND HOW MUCH WATER CAN TAKE
Line_4418	UM LIKE
Line_4419	MMM I DON'T RE I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO IT COULDN'T DROP WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER
Line_4422	I DON'T KNOW WE JUST DID THAT
Line_4423	YEAH MMM HMM
Line_4424	MMM NO YEAH BUT THE SYRINGE HAD BIG SYRINGES AND LITTLE SYRINGES
Line_4425	MMM WHEN MILLILITERS YEAH
Line_4426	UH-HUH YEAH SO
Line_4427	THREE OR A HUNDRED THE CUP HUNDRED
Line_4428	YEAH WE GOT THE LITTLE ONE YEAH
Line_4429	MMM WE PUT SOME WATER LIKE THAT AND THEN WE PUT IN THE CAN
Line_4430	MMM IT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBER YEAH
Line_4431	UM I LEARNED THAT
Line_4432	THAT AMERICA'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT DOESN'T USE THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T CAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THEY IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NOT ALL STRAWS ARE THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	WERE THEY SOME OF THEM WERE SIMILAR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE CUT IT OUT THEM WE COULD WELL UM ONCE WE CUT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WE
Line_4440	UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH WE UM WE
Line_4442	MEASURED UM THE BOOKSHELF
Line_4443	BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE BY THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO ER
Line_4444	MMM NO
Line_4445	WELL UM LIKE I SAID WE TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WAS ONE INCH SIX INCHES AND
Line_4446	MMM NO
Line_4447	IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4448	BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE A LITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT IN THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
Line_4449	IT WAS NONE I MEAN THREE MMM HMM MMM HMM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS MMM HMM
Line_4451	IT'S NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STANDARD UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAMS
Line_4455	LIKE I SAID THESE WERE LIKE THE CUBES THE ONE AND THE FIVE
Line_4456	UM IT'S DIVIDED BY IT'S DIVISION
Line_4457	YES THE THE CHIP
Line_4458	YES MMM NO
Line_4459	YEAH MMM HMM BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOMETIMES
Line_4461	UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CUBES WE JUST USED PAPER CLIPS INSTEAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRIED TO GET WITH OUR WITH OUR GRAMS WE TRIED TO GET
Line_4464	INSTEAD CAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL OF THOSE BLOCKS WE COULD JUST USE
Line_4465	THAT THAT TEN THAT
Line_4466	THAT TEN ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE THE BOX THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	MMM KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TURNS DOING IT SO IT TOOK LONGER INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PERSON
Line_4470	YEAH AND ONE TIME IT WAS AT LIKE AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS AT SIX THEN IT WAS AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS AT EIGHT THEN IT WAS AT SIX YEAH IT WAS WEIRD
Line_4471	YEAH YEAH UM MAYBE BECAUSE
Line_4472	BECAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM
Line_4473	UM MAYBE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TELL IT SO WELL THAT
Line_4474	UM JUST KEEP IT IN ONE SPOT
Line_4475	Y UM
Line_4476	YEAH YEAH AND THEN OUR TEACHER SHE ONLY MESSED UP ON THE LAST TWO
Line_4477	MMM YES EXCEPT WE DIDN'T LIKE DO COLD MEDIUM WE JUST SAID IT IN THE ORDER
Line_4478	YEAH
Line_4479	YEAH YEAH
Line_4480	UM THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN ENDED AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN THOSE
Line_4481	UM WELL I'M
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM LET'S THE BALANCE UM S IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLE WOBBY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE EQUAL YEAH A BIG ONE EQUALS A GRAM
Line_4486	WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT
Line_4487	YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH W F FIRST I HOLD IT IN MY HANDS AND I WEIGH IT AND THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USE
Line_4490	MMM HMM AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL AND IT
Line_4491	MMM HMM YEAH UH-HUH YEP
Line_4492	UM I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WAY NOT ALL THE WAY
Line_4494	N MMM NOT REALLY
Line_4495	YEAH ONE MILLILITER
Line_4496	UH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THEY JUST FLIPPED UP
Line_4498	I THINK IT JUST IS TRYING TO TRICK US BUT Y YOU JUST DID THAT ONE YOU ALREADY DID THAT ONE
Line_4499	HUH WELL THEN PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
Line_4500	THAT'S A F THAT'S A UM
Line_4501	THE LINES WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FULL IT WOULD BE IT
Line_4502	YEAH CAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE'S WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND UH PLASTIC CHIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCALE THING WE WOULD PUT IT ON THIS WAY AND IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD U PUT MORE AND MORE AND MORE UNTIL IT GOT EVENED OUT
Line_4507	IT UM THERE'S MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THEY WOULD
Line_4508	OOPS UM
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TOO
Line_4510	YEAH AND
Line_4511	TAKE OUT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THEN IT WOULD GO TONK BUT IT'S FLOATING IT'S FLOATING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CRUISE AND GO AWESOME
Line_4516	OKAY BYE BYE
Line_4517	UH YEAH
Line_4518	HI
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOAKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHED IT PUT PUT UM THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPONGE DID NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	THEN WE GOT IT WET SOAKED UP ALL THE WATERS IT COULD THEN WE WEIGHED IT AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_4526	TO CLEAN WET AND WITH DIRTY WATER WOULD ABSORB THE DIRTY WATER MMM HMM
Line_4527	NO I DIDN'T I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMPTY CUPS CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
Line_4530	YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL IS YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO TAP OF THAT YOU CAN TAP THIS PART
Line_4531	OH KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND I ALREADY KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDRED UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OF FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO A KILOGRAM IS PROBABLY GONNA BE AS HEAVY AS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS OR TWENTY G'S
Line_4537	AND THAT ONE WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S IT STILL HAS A LOTTA
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER'S A A PICTURE'S AS HEAVY AS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOGRAM PLUS ONE L OF WATER LITER
Line_4541	YEAH IT'S IT'S STILL THE FUN PART TOO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPONGE W WE UM MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WET SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPONGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	THAT'S A FIVE AND THEN THAT'S A ONE THEN
Line_4546	IT WA INSTEAD OF ALWAYS HAVING TO USE UM JUST S SMALL LITTLE PIECES THEY CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALED OUT SO THAT'LL BE FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS EVENED OUT AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THIS WOULD BE SIXTEEN THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S AIRLOCK AIR UH LOCKET INSIDE OF EM
Line_4551	AND YEP AND THEN THAT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
Line_4552	UH-HUH YEP
Line_4553	YEP AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER BECAUSE THE WATER'S HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THE AIRLOCK IF ALL THE AIRLOCK IS GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ACTUALLY WAIT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	OKAY SO YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO HERE
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT SEP WITH NO WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEP YOU HAVE A SCALE AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUITS YOUR VEGETABLES AND
Line_4559	PUT IT ON THE SCALE AND IT WEIGHS
Line_4560	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS
Line_4561	SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4564	IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK
Line_4565	THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	UM YOU CAN FLIP
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK
Line_4571	I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE
Line_4572	I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN
Line_4573	YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
Line_4577	THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN
Line_4578	WE
Line_4579	YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT
Line_4583	WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY
Line_4588	I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS
Line_4589	I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
Line_4590	BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4593	OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
Line_4595	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
Line_4597	SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE X AXIS IS THE PENDULUM LENGTH JUST THE PENDULUM LENGTH AND NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAPH FOR PROJECTING LET'S FOR TEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETER SWING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST MY YOU COULD TEST YOUR PREDICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE THE LONGER THE PENDULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PENDULUMS AND BOATS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4606	THE BOAT WOULDN'T STAY FLOATING IT WOULD JUST GO DOWN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY YOUR BOAT WILL TIP OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE BOATS COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHERS AND THE FOUR AND A COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
Line_4609	HOW THE PENNIES WERE STACKED LET'S SAY A WAS STACKED REALLY SLOPPILY AND D WAS STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE IS DOWN MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YES
Line_4612	I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
Line_4613	A CORK AND YEAH
Line_4614	AND OH AND WE ALSO MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCES WAS
Line_4615	WELL I THINK THE
Line_4616	SO UM THE METER STICK IS STANDING UP AND THE FLIP
Line_4617	THE ITEM AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S FLIPPING
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE ONE IS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND ON TO THE GROUND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKING AIRPLANES AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HAD GRAPHS ABOUT PENDULUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PENDULUM MMM HA IS FIFTEEN
Line_4624	THE ON THE LEFT SIDE UM
Line_4625	IS THE NUMBER OF
Line_4626	S HOW MANY SWINGS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS AND THE PENDULUM NA LENGTHS AND IS
Line_4628	WELL WE WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKING THE PLANE BUT WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	FIRST THE AIRPLANE AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WERE MAKING HIM SOME BOATS
Line_4630	WE HAD UM THAT'LL
Line_4631	A LITTLE PADDLE THING FOR THE WIND THING FOR THE FRONT
Line_4632	THE AIRPLANE IS GOING UP THE LINE
Line_4633	WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE PLANE YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW CAUSE I HAVEN'T UM UH TRIED IT YET
Line_4635	I'M GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4636	WE CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANYTHING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS A UM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRAPH WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND THAT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	LIKE FIVE GROUPS OF TWO HUNDRED
Line_4641	IT'S GOING REALLY WELL
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARK THE GRAPH AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM'S LENGTH MAY BE MARKED AND HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	UM THE NUMBERS ARE THERE AND UM THE NAME WHERE IT IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THE THE BOTTOM DOT OR THE HIGHEST DOT
Line_4646	UM IT'S GOING WELL
Line_4647	IT'S GOING VERY WELL THANKS
Line_4648	WE'RE STILL UM STUDY LEARNING ABOUT CATAPULTS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THEM SO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT
Line_4650	WE DID A POPSICLE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE
Line_4651	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED THE UM THE THING YOU PUT THE STICK IN ON AND TO MAKE IT UM JUMP
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORK YOU AND THE RUBBER THE RUBBER STOPPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM H THAT LOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO JUMP REALLY FAR
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES FLYING FLIP STICK
Line_4655	UM YOU NEED I THINK YOU NEED THE
Line_4656	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOATS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FLOAT OR THEY'LL DR OR THEY'LL OR THEY'LL UM DROWN
Line_4658	TO FLOAT ON WATER AND UM SO PEOPLE COULD GET ON THEM AND SEE THE OCEAN
Line_4659	SCISSORS UM WATER AND UM THAT'S IT
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD CA
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UM PEOPLE
Line_4662	UM WE COU WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT CAN FIT UNTIL IT DROWNED IT
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION VERY WELL
Line_4664	A LOT OF PENNIES UM THERE'S SOME PENNIES IN THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOATING IN WATER
Line_4665	THEY REMIND ME OF LIKE THE PENNIES BEING PASSENGERS
Line_4666	I THEY REMIND ME ABOUT HOW MANY PENNIES WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT SINKS
Line_4667	REALLY BY UP IT IT SINKS FASTER CAUSE UM
Line_4668	CAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM HIGH IT
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHT CAUSE UM
Line_4670	HAVE CAN UM CAUSE IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM T THE BIG ONES CARRY MORE CAUSE IT'S CAUSE IT'S TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CAN CAN CARRY MORE CAUSE IT'S TALLER AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CARRY C CARRIES LESS CAUSE IT'S SMALLER
Line_4672	WE COULD HAVE AND OUT AND THEY COULD JUMP
Line_4673	I THINK IT'S FISH WIRE IT'S FISH LIKE THE LIKE K THE KIND OF STRING YOU USE TO CATCH FISH
Line_4674	IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T FLY CAUSE IT NEEDS STRING TO FLY IT
Line_4675	I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON ON THE STRING YOU WOULD TIE IT TO A CHAIR THEN PUT THE AIRPLANE AND SEE HOW MANY WINDS IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT MAKE IF FLY
Line_4677	IT GIVES IT MORE AIR SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN FLY FASTER
Line_4678	WITHOUT THE PROPELLER IT WOULDN'T FLY BECAUSE ANY YOU NEED TO SPIN IT AND THE RUBBER BAND WOULD HAVE NOWHERE TO UM TO
Line_4679	SHOW IT ON THE COMPUTER AND LOOKED IT UP ALL LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKE THE RUBBER BAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF THE PROPELLER AND SPIN IT AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THERE ARE TWO AIRPLANES AND THEY'RE ON STRING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S KIND OF GOING DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GONNA BE HARDER FOR THE THE FOR THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN CAUSE IT'S GOING TO NEED WAY MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RUBBER BANDS UM SWINGS LIKE TWIRLS AROUND UM THE PROPELLER IS GOING SO IT COULDN'T GET MORE AIR
Line_4686	THERE ARE TWO A AIRPLANES AND THEY'RE KIND OF
Line_4687	LIKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS KIND OF LIKE HANGING AROUND LIKE NOT THAT HIGH
Line_4688	THIS GRAPH IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLANES THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SCIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAPHING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULD
Line_4690	WELL THE CONTROLLED THINGS IN MY EXPERIMENT ARE
Line_4691	IT WAS ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR THE FLIPPER OR THE CORK WOULD GO
Line_4692	I THOUGHT OF
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND
Line_4694	THEY WERE MAINLY ABOUT LIKE HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THEM TO MAKE THEM SWING FASTER OR SLOWER AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENDULUMS AND HOW THEY SWING
Line_4696	THE GRAPH IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
Line_4697	THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ALREADY SWING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4699	TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PREDICATION IS WRONG OR RIGHT YOU CAN SWING IT NORMALLY FROM THE SURFACE THAT IT'S ON OR LIKE THE DESK OR THE CEILING OR SOMETHING BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T COUNT LIKE EVERY TIME IT SWINGS JUST LIKE COUNT TWO SECONDS AND THEN THAT'S ONE
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
Line_4701	RUBBER BAND AND IT JUST THE PROPELLER BARELY EVEN SPINNED WHENEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRAPH WITH AN X AND Y AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS AND THEN DISTANCE WOULD GO ON THE X AXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE X AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU'VE GATHERED UM IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	THE Y AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRANDFATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TYPE THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES UH ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECOND GOES AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS TO SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSITE SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLANES THAT WE'VE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEY'RE KINDA LIKE CATAPULTS YOU PUSH DOWN ON
Line_4724	N OF THE FOUR
Line_4725	MAKE YOU ABLE TO SHOOT
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	UM WHAT I THINK IS THE HIGHER THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOOT
Line_4728	IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIGHER THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE S STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WAY SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRETTY HARD
Line_4730	OR YOU COULD PUT ONE AT A TIME YOU'D PUT THE STICK INTO THE FLIPPER BASE AND YOU'D HAVE THE FLIPPER BASE ON THE ANGLE BRACE THEN YOU COULD PUT THE RUBBER STOPPER IN OR YOU CAN PUT THE CORK IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTHS OF THE STICKS ARE EACH A CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIGHER OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER CAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPER BASE AND WE'RE SHOOTING FLIPPER BASES WE'RE SHOOTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON A PLASTIC ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS HIGH
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT UH ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER CAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECT
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS AND TODAY WE DID HOW DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A LOT LOT SHORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	AND THE TWO HUNDRED DID FIVE SWINGS AND THEN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY DID SIX SWINGS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN TWO HUNDRED ONE HUN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY CENTIMETERS DID SEVEN SWINGS NINETY CENTIMETERS DID EIGHT SWINGS SEVENTY CENTIMETERS DID NINE SWINGS FIFTY FIVE CENTIMETERS DID FIVE SWINGS FORTY FIVE CENTIMETERS DID ELEVEN SWINGS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	TH HOW MANY SWINGS OR HOW MANY THINGS ARE IN A BOTTLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LIKE GUESS HOW MANY ARE IN OR HOW MANY IT'LL DO
Line_4748	I'VE BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS
Line_4749	THEY KEEP TIME KIND OF LIKE ON A GRANDFATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'D SINK THE BOAT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TEENY BIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFEBOATS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE S SOME OTHER TIME
Line_4758	KNOW WHICH ONE WAS VERY
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW CAUSE I WASN'T HERE ON THURSDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TOO HARD IT MIGHT SINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK EARLIER THAN USUAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLANES
Line_4763	THE HIGHER THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4764	THE HIGHER OR THE MORE PASSENGERS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAPHED ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE Y LINE WAS WHERE YOU PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE X LINE WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASSENGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD
Line_4769	Y ONE THE Y AXIS IS WHERE YOU PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
Line_4770	AND THEY BOTH
Line_4771	TWENTY FIVE IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PASSENGERS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANY ONE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND A PAPERCLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT COULD GO UH THIS MORE TIMES TOO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPERCLIP THE PENNY AND THE PENCIL
Line_4779	UH THE STRING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THEY WILL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PENNIES GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE UH FASTER IT'LL SWING SIDE WAYS O
Line_4783	S STUDYING UH THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWINGING SIDE WAYS
Line_4785	THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PAPERCLIP
Line_4786	UH IT'S HANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE SWUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFTEEN IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	UH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UH IF MAY BE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID AT THE LAST STARTING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATAPULTS
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	SO YOU NEED AN ANGLE BRACE A FLIP STICK A CORK
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE CORK GOES AFTER YOU LAUNCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CORK LIKE FLY
Line_4800	UM I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LAUNCHED THE CORK
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO UM LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIRST STICK
Line_4802	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CORK WAS LAUNCHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN LAUNCH THE CORK
Line_4804	WELL I CHANGED THE ANGLE FOR VARIABLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
Line_4805	I NOTICED THAT THE SHORTER THE STICK'S IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT F FURTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WEIGHT OF THE CORK MAKES 'EM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENDULUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PENNY IN THE IT MAKES THE PENNY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT'S SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S A GRAPH TO SEE HOW LONG UH THE S PENDULUM IS
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRAPH FROM UH SH BIGGEST TO LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE AN ESTIMATE UH YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM SUBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS GETTING UH SH LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UM I FORGET
Line_4818	UM IF I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND IT'LL STILL BE THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU CAN SEE YOUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID UH STUFF ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4821	UH SO THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UH I F DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UH PENNIES ARE LIKE PASSENGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL UH IF THERE'S MORE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE A AND NONE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
Line_4825	SOMEONE'S DROPPING MORE PENNIES INTO THE BOAT
Line_4826	MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BOAT
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING ME A GRAPH ABOUT UH BOATS
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE A BUNCH OF THINGS IT
Line_4831	I IT WOULD LIKE SINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD
Line_4834	I FIGURED OUT THAT UH THE BIGGER THE LIFEBOATS THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOAT IS
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PENNIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOAT
Line_4837	A IS THE BIGGEST IT WOULD A HOLD MORE PASSENGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PENNIES YOU CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PASSENGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY UH OF THE BOAT WHICH IS MA
Line_4840	UH WELL THEY SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST TO OR OR LEAST TO GREATEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THAT THE NUMBERS RISING UP
Line_4843	THE X AXIS IS THE WHERE THE CAPACITY MILLIMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PASSENGERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE X AXIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE Y AXIS IS ON SORT OF THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE Y AXIS SHOWS HOW MANY PASSENGERS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE Y AXIS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOAT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALLER PENNIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOAT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4850	I NOTICED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE THE PASSENGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GREW
Line_4851	IT EITHER GOT THE PASSENGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH THE DIFFERENCE IS AND IT'LL BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL X IS NUMBER OF MOTORS OR RUBBERBANDS AND Y IS THE DISTANCE
Line_4854	IT'LL GO PRETTY FAR
Line_4855	WELL IT'S UM OTHER SIDE SO IT'LL BE EASIER TO LIST
Line_4856	WELL YOU PLACE THE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE AND THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE RIGHT THERE SO YOU IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RUBBERBANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASSENGERS OR ME AND MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL IT IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FEW DAYS AGO WE FLEW PAPER AIRPLANES
Line_4860	UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM
Line_4861	CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4863	SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF IT'S SHORTER IT WILL GO FAST SLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY VARIABLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAT THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
Line_4869	THE SHORTER IT GETS THE THE MORE SWINGS IT DOES IT TAKES
Line_4870	ACTUALLY THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT HAS
Line_4871	UM LET'S SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS IT'S A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRING IS THEN THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PREDICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND THE LAUNCHER OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE DID SO FAR AND WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THIS ACTUALLY MAKING IT TOMORROW
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GONNA PUT A CORK AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH IT AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR IT'LL GO
Line_4876	THAT THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THE CORK IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH AND THEN THE RUBBER STOPPER HELPS IT UM STAY UP AND THEN
Line_4877	A I'M NOT SURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE FLIPPER BASE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RUBBER STOP
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A PICTURE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4880	YEP THE WEIGHT MAY UM AFFECT HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4881	YEAH WE'LL PROBABLY TRY OUT AND LAUNCH THOSE
Line_4882	WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE EITHER A GRAPH OR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A CHART
Line_4883	THEY'RE ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO SEE UM W HOW MANY PENNIES CAN FIT INTO IT WITHOUT IT SINKING AND UM
Line_4884	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
Line_4886	HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE 'EM IT MIGHT HA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UM LET'S SEE IF W
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP 'EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS M
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LL OVERFLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONCE THE BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD LET'S SEE UM
Line_4897	CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU
Line_4899	KNOW IF THEY'RE WRONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK 'EM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GONNA SINK IF YOU STACK 'EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD UM
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT
Line_4903	WITH STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	IF LET'S SEE UM WE'RE
Line_4905	THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT OF PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	WE'RE GONNA S WE S SEE HOW MANY CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD
Line_4908	TO HOLD PENNIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH ONE WOULD
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL THE BOAT IS
Line_4913	F YOU DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SET 'EM IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT 'EM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT'LL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER'S TOO ROUGH THE BOAT COULD TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES AND IT'LL STAY UP
Line_4917	THE S THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGERS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE 'EM A SMALLER OR BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
Line_4919	THE UM THE CAP
Line_4920	CAPACITY IS UH HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PASSENGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAPHS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE S SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING 'EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT 'EM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT IN PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4926	IT'S HOW CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS OF THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND ONE
Line_4929	THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
Line_4930	THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS
Line_4931	THE HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW IT COULD WHEN WE SPIN IT HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS THE PROPELLER UP AND THEN YOU HAVE
Line_4936	BODY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLY
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD APART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU UH WIND UP THE PROPELLER
Line_4938	WELL ME AND MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING AT AN ANGLE AND WE LEARNED THAT IF YOU PUT IT AT AN ANGLE IT
Line_4939	EFFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLY
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TWO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH IT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE FIGURED OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS IT HAS THE S THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT'LL MAKE THE PLANE GO SLOWER AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WINDS IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL THE MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT AFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF IT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKE IT BETTER
Line_4948	OR YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR
Line_4949	WELL IF LIKE YOU TAKE OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS IT MIGHT AFFECT THE PLANE
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANES AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICED THAT WITH ONCE AGAIN WITH
Line_4952	MORE WITH MORE PAS AS YOU ADD MORE PASSENGERS THE L LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR AROUND THAT
Line_4954	THE N NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RUBBER BANDS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PASSENGER AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID IN MY TEST
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS UM TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DESK AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN JUST LET GO OF 'EM AND COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TRY OH YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THAT
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I THINK SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_4968	THE FLIPPER STICK HAS UM
Line_4969	IT SHOWS HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SO I AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMETERS
Line_4970	S
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS WITH THE EXPERIMENT IT MATTERS
Line_4972	ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE A LOT OF THING IT'LL THE EXPERIMENT MIGHT BE WRONG AND YOU'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S RIGHT OR NOT
Line_4974	IT EFFECTS THE RESULTS BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE
Line_4975	IT'S A GRAPH
Line_4976	IT'S COUNTING BY TENS AND IT'S MOVING UP BY CENTIMETERS
Line_4977	IT'S GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE STRING
Line_4980	SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WE UM MEASURE IT ON UM
Line_4983	O ON MEASURING TAPE
Line_4984	WE KEPT THE PENNY AND THE PAPERCLIP THE SAME AND THE LOOP THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOAT IN THE OCEAN AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSENGERS AND SOMETIMES EMERGENCY LUGGAGE
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE S DREW A CROSS
Line_4987	WE BUILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUT CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANT SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN EFFECT IT BY THE SIZE OR
Line_4990	SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGE
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PENNIES IN THEM CAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIZE THE PLACEMENT OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNIE
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I FIGURED UM I DON'T KNOW VARI VARIABLES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOATS WERE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WAIT
Line_5000	WE DID BY US DOING EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY MAKING THEIR BOATS PRETTY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE Y AXIS IS THE UM THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THE BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT VERTICAL LINE
Line_5005	WHICH WORDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW VARIABLES CHANGE THINGS
Line_5008	THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GETS SMALLER TOO SO PRETTY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BYE MARNIE HAVE A NICE DAY
Line_5011	HI UH HI MY NAME IS CATHERINE AND I'M NINE YEARS OLD WILL YOU TELL ME A QUESTION
Line_5012	MEASURING DECLINE AND SUMMIT
Line_5013	ALL ABOUT HEIGHT AND I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A RULER AND UM A METER STICK
Line_5016	THEY'RE TUBES
Line_5017	AND TALL AND S AND TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WELL UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	UH I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5022	THE DOORKNOB ON THE PICTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SOR SORRY
Line_5025	I SEE A ONE METER TEN METERS A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WIDTH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN RULERS
Line_5028	A DOORKNOB MEAN A A KNOB ON A DOOR
Line_5029	YOU CAN UM MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A RULER
Line_5030	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HAND
Line_5032	BRAIN CAN HELP YOU ESTIMATE AND
Line_5033	IT IS TEN CENTIMETERS ON IN THIS PICTURE
Line_5034	ALL THOSE HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS ALL IN ALL
Line_5035	THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A RULER AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MOST MOST MORE COMMON
Line_5037	THIS BOY IS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
Line_5039	ER WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS UM YARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABBY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER NECK
Line_5042	THEY'RE BOTH THE
Line_5043	AND SOME ARE DIFFERENT LENGTHS THAN OTHERS
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU COULD USE A RULER OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN METER STICKS AND RULERS
Line_5047	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5048	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM WITH A SCALE
Line_5049	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5050	WELL THERE ARE WEIGHTS THAT ARE LIKE UH HEAVIEST TO LIGHTEST
Line_5051	THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT CAUSE THE METAL WASHER
Line_5052	METAL'S HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC THAT'S THE ANSWER
Line_5053	WELL THE FIR THE HEAVIEST WOULD BE THE MAGNET MAYBE THEN THE THEN THE WOODEN THEN THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE CHIP
Line_5054	I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING'S NOT BALANCED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS AND SEE THEN YOU MAKE IT MEASURE THE SO IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5056	THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THAN THE CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURE SHOWED ME THAT THAT THE METAL WASHER WAS H THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MORE ACCURATE
Line_5061	WELL IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT LITTLE
Line_5062	WELL MEASURING IT'S LIKE BUT WELL UM I FORGOT
Line_5063	WE USED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5065	WELL SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CUP'S SMALL ONE PAPER CUP'S BIG
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HEAVIEST AND ONE'S NOT HEAVIEST
Line_5068	THE LITTLE CUBE IN FRONT OF ME AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS FOUR GRAMS ALL THE WAY UNTIL INFINITY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	IN THIS PICTURE IT TAKES EIGHT GRAMS TO FILL THAT METAL WASHER
Line_5072	ON SEVEN SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE THEN THE METAL WASHER GETS HEAVIER IN GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT'LL BE BALANCED
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAMS TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	I DON'T KNOW WHAT GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	OKAY UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH-HUH UH I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5078	I DO NOT BETWEEN YOU AND ME I DO NOT KNOW SORRY
Line_5079	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERENCE IS OR WHAT IT ME
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THESE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKES SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TOY C TO MEASURE THAT TOY CAR AND KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	I I I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TOO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO TO MAKE IT BALANCE
Line_5086	A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVY AND YOU USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASUREMENT MEASUREMENT
Line_5091	WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
Line_5092	WELL WE'VE BEEN MEASURING AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
Line_5093	UH WELL IT CAN PROBABLY HOLD LIKE
Line_5094	WELL THESE ARE LINES THAT THAT CAN PROBABLY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT CAN PROBABLY HOLD
Line_5095	WELL VIAL TWO COULD HOLD LESS AND VIAL ONE COULD HOLD MORE LIKE TWICE THAT MUCH OF VIAL TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VIAL COULD PRO GROUP
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER CAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS THAT WAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER'S HOLDING A THOUSAND MILLILITERS OR ONE ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH IT CAN
Line_5100	I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOWS US ONE MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM MILLILITERS IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR HOW HIGH IT CAN GO WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE BIG FAT TUBIE THING THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5104	IT TAKES TEN LITTLE TUBIES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BAKE A CAKE YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS
Line_5106	UM WELL I FORGOT
Line_5107	A MILLIMETER IS BIGGER AND A LITER IS SMALLER
Line_5108	YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS A FEW UM INCHES MILLIMETERS OR LITERS
Line_5110	IT CAN HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE TU BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	IT IS MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS IN THE SYRINGE
Line_5113	WELL IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCIENCE
Line_5114	UM I DON'T KNOW YOU WOULD PUT THE WATER IN THE SYRINGE AND WE WOULD SPRAY IT INTO SOMETHING TO SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	WELL I AM SEEING FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_5116	WELL SYRINGE CAN UM CAN MMM
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS FILL UP A CUP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH IT CAN TAKE HOW MUCH IT'LL HOLD BUT IT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP AT FIFTY MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES REPRESENT UH HOW MANY IT HOLDS
Line_5120	IT IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_5121	I THINK IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN HOLD HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER IN OR LIQUIDS IN IT
Line_5123	WELL THERE'S MORE GRADUATED CYLINDERS THAT ARE FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5124	WELL I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT
Line_5125	WHEN WE PREDICT YOU COULD MAKE AN ESTIMATE AND MAKE A LINE AND SEE IF IT'LL GO OVER OR UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING IS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN EST
Line_5127	TE WE COULD TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM MARK SEE
Line_5129	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDIED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M OBSERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS AT ALL
Line_5132	THE CUP ON THE LEFT HAS MORE THAN THE CUP ON THE RIGHT
Line_5133	WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY STUDIED CAPACITY SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A C WATER IN A CONTAINER AND YOU FILL IT UP AND IT'S CAPACITY
Line_5135	IT SAYS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSEL
Line_5136	S THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL HOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIGHER FATTER SKINNIER AND THEY COULD JUST ALL HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	THEY WELL EVERY ONE EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU PUT IN IS A HUNDRED AND EQUALS TWO TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLD THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5139	MASS WEIGHT
Line_5140	CAPACITY IS UM WHAT THE WHAT THE UM CAN CAN POSSIBLY WHAT UM WHAT IT CAN PO WHAT SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY
Line_5141	IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_5142	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND UM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
Line_5143	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY I'M SORRY
Line_5144	THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CAPACITY
Line_5145	UM YOU COULD POUR TO THE BRIM
Line_5146	YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND POUR ONE WATER TWO WATER AND SO ON AND SO ON UNTIL YOU GET
Line_5147	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT I DON'T
Line_5148	H UM WITH THE SYRINGE YOU COULD ADD YOU COULD ADD FIFTY A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THREE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED AND THEN
Line_5149	YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND DO IT I GUESS
Line_5150	MASS ACTUALLY VOLUME OKAY
Line_5151	UM MILLILITERS ARE UM A TYPE OF ALRIGHT I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY I'M SO SORRY
Line_5152	OKAY UM UM AND IT SHOWS YOU WHAT
Line_5153	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS INSTEAD IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED
Line_5154	IT'S HAS MUCH AS THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_5155	IT'S THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_5156	IT IS NOT PUTTING AS MUCH AS IT COULD
Line_5157	VOLUME IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY HO
Line_5158	UM IT DOESN'T HOLD AS MUCH AS WELL THAT'S HOW MUCH IT COULD POSSIBLY HOLD IT'S NOT WELL IN REAL LIFE IT'S PROBABLY NOT HOLDING AS MUCH AS THAT
Line_5159	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5160	UM I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT WITH MY LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE NOT SAYING THAT I'M DUMB
Line_5161	VOLUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PICTURE
Line_5162	CAPACITY IS HIGHER THAN THE VOLUME
Line_5163	THEY'RE A BEAKER A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND A SYRINGE THEY ALL MEASURE UM VOLUME
Line_5164	IT WILL MO IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE THE SYRINGE HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_5165	MEASURE MASS AND THE CAPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLUME
Line_5166	THE SYRINGES ARE FILLING UP THEY EACH HAVE FIFTY OH BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH FOR FORTY TWO SO IT HAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY
Line_5167	THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_5168	THE TWOS OR THE UNITS I
Line_5169	EVERY TEN MILLILITERS
Line_5170	YOU COULD USE SYRINGES AND JUST MEASURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY BE EASIER
Line_5171	YOU COULD JUST USE THE SYRINGE AND SUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD POUR IT OUT
Line_5172	IT SUCKS UP WATER AND THEN IT'S IT OUT THEN YOU PUSH PULL SUCKS IN PUSH S
Line_5173	IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY MIL
Line_5174	YOU COULD SQUIRT IT INTO A BEATER BEAKER NOT A BEATER
Line_5175	OH WELL THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
Line_5176	UM WELL EVERY SINGLE MINUTE THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED WITH THE WITH THE CUP WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_5177	I FORGOT DANG IT
Line_5178	WELL IT SHOW ME THAT'S COLD AND IT CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
Line_5179	WELL WE DID UM EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD CHECK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT ARE THING WERE
Line_5180	UM WE PUT UH HOW MUCH CELSIUS
Line_5181	IT SAYS FIFTEEN
Line_5182	WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AT FOUR
Line_5183	WELL WHEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IT MMM YOU PUT THE THERMOMETER
Line_5184	WE OBSERVED TEN MINUTES
Line_5185	WELL IT CHANGES BECAUSE THE ARE COLD AND IT'LL FREEZE
Line_5186	UM IT GOES UP GOV AND IT GOES DOWN
Line_5187	TEN CELSIUS
Line_5188	IT WILL CAN TELL YOU
Line_5189	WELL YOU SHOULD AND THEN IF YOU COUNT YOUR WAY UP TO WHERE THE UM THERMO
Line_5190	AT BELOW ZERO IT'S CELSIUS
Line_5191	ONE OF THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS
Line_5192	WELL WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GAS IN IT AND THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO UP
Line_5193	IT'S CALLED UM MILLERIA AND WHEN IT GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
Line_5194	LO MY NAME IS SARAH UM I'M REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
Line_5195	YES AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO START
Line_5196	WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_5197	UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE
Line_5198	UM LENGTH IS UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
Line_5199	THEY MIGHT COME UP WITH A DECISION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT STANDARD
Line_5200	IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE METER IS AND UM HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_5201	METERS ARE USED IN SCIENTIFIC STUDY FOR LIKE REALLY LONG THINGS OR REALLY SHORT THINGS AND YEAH
Line_5202	HOW LONG THE DOOR KNOB IS FROM THE FLOOR
Line_5203	THEY ARE PART OF THE METRIC SYSTEM OF THE WORLD
Line_5204	WELL WHAT OUR TEACHER SAYS IS USE YOUR PINKIE FOR CENTIMETERS AND YOUR THUMB AND PINKIE FOR A DECIMETERS
Line_5205	HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW
Line_5206	WELL THIS IS AN OLD SAYING PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT
Line_5207	UM PRETTY GOOD
Line_5208	WITH LIKE A METER OR A RULER OR A YARD STICK
Line_5209	TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS OR REALLY SMALL THINGS
Line_5210	YOU GET A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE
Line_5211	UNDER YOUR ELBOW TO YOUR WRIST
Line_5212	ROBBIE'S NOSE IS ONE PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIE'S FINGERS FINGER LENGTH
Line_5213	W I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT A REFERENCE IS
Line_5214	UM I DIDN'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER BODY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONES I'VE TOLD YOU
Line_5215	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE STANDARD SYSTEM AND OTHER S UM SYSTEMS
Line_5216	WE UM I COMPARING MASS WE DO MASS
Line_5217	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE METAL'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE HEAVIEST
Line_5218	WELL YOU COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND OR ANYWHERE
Line_5219	UM MEASUREMENTS MORE ACCURATELY THAN YEAH
Line_5220	EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHTS
Line_5221	TWO GROUPS OF PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIP
Line_5222	HAS THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5223	YOU WOULD GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5224	THEY'RE THE SCRAM GRAM UM
Line_5225	S IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN
Line_5226	BLOCKS WE USED GRAM BLOCKS
Line_5227	UM GRAMS UM O
Line_5228	ONE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM BLOCK
Line_5229	THAT THE PAPER CLIPS ARE ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF A GRAM AND THAT THE ME THE UM PLASTIC DISK IS FOUR GRAMS
Line_5230	EIGHT GRAMS EQUALS ONE METAL DISK
Line_5231	IT'LL BE UM IT'LL BE LIKE RIGHT
Line_5232	UM THE STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS
Line_5233	THE STANDARD UNITS AND ALSO INCHES AND UM FEET
Line_5234	WOOD CHIP I'M SORRY FOR THE PAUSE BIG PAUSE
Line_5235	WEIGHT WEIGHING
Line_5236	WELL YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE SOMETHING
Line_5237	UM SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRAMS SOMETHING IS
Line_5238	UM I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5239	GRAMS ARE UM A UNIT OF MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_5240	THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
Line_5241	HELLO
Line_5242	UM THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THERE AND THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THERE
Line_5243	UM YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5244	IT'S A SMALL GRAM I'M GUESSING
Line_5245	OH IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_5246	WEIGHING HEAVIER THINGS
Line_5247	IT IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5248	O EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
Line_5249	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UM DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND MASS
Line_5250	DRY SPONGE WET SPONGE SOAKED SPONGE
Line_5251	UM IT'S REALLY DRY AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WEIGH THAT MUCH
Line_5252	UM IT'S GOING TO WEIGH A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE SOAKED SPONGE
Line_5253	UM I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IT'S THE SOAKED SPONGE OR WET SPONGE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
Line_5254	SO YEAH
Line_5255	THE DRY SPONGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	UM NOT MUCH
Line_5257	THE DRY SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5258	IT SIXTEEN GRAMS IS THAT CORRECT
Line_5259	UM YOU CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH UM
Line_5260	HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGH HI ROBBIE
Line_5261	GRAMS GRAMS GRAM
Line_5262	BYE MIRACLE
Line_5263	GOOD
Line_5264	THE SANDALWOOD BOX AND STUFF
Line_5265	YOU COULD WEIGH THE WATER
Line_5266	GRAM PIECES ANOTHER CUP A LOT OF IT'S
Line_5267	UM YOU COULD GET IF YOU PUT UM THE WATER THAT YOU COULD HAVE
Line_5268	ISN'T IT VOLUME MASS AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVEL YOU CAN MEASURE A LOT OF SMALL OBJECTS WITH US
Line_5271	MULTIPLYING IT BY A HUNDRED
Line_5272	SMALL DISK
Line_5273	THIS THERMOMETER'S UM COUNTING BY TENS THIS IS COUNTING BY ONES AND THIS IS COUNTING BY HUNDREDS
Line_5274	UM THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN SORRY
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR LIQUID
Line_5277	COOKING BAKING I'VE USED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5278	UM THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT LITERS EIGHTY EIGHT MILLILITERS
Line_5279	SMALL OBJECTS OR LIQUID OBJECTS
Line_5280	IT'S A MINIMUM IT'S SMALLER THAN THE METER
Line_5281	VIAL A MEASURING CUP A MEASURING SPOON
Line_5282	A BALANCE
Line_5283	I CAN'T WHAT'S IT'S CALLED BUT IT'S USED FOR MEDICINE AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED A PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TEST LIKE THAT
Line_5285	THE MILLILITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBERS THAT THE SYRINGE HOLDS IT WAS REALLY FUN TO SCROLL UP
Line_5287	YOUR VOICE IS LOUD TODAY BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	WE USE A SPOON BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW ONE TWO THREE
Line_5289	THOSE ARE MILLIMETERS
Line_5290	TWO HEATED CYLINDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR UM SMALL OBJECT
Line_5292	IT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONE'S TO B AND ONE'S TO D
Line_5295	ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS AND THAT'S HOW THE SPACE THAT THIS CUP CONTAINS
Line_5296	UM I DESCRIBED I DESCRIBED IT UM LIKE THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING CONTAINS
Line_5297	COULD USE A SYRINGE YOU COULD BUY A SYRINGE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL IT UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT IF IT'S I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING'S TALLER BUT SKINNIER AND IF SOMETHING'S SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT'LL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM
Line_5301	THEY ARE EITHER TALLER BUT SKINNIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZERO
Line_5304	ONE MINUTE THAT'S ALL IT TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN IT'S HOTTER DOWN WHEN IT'S COLDER
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER IT GOT TWENTY DEGREE COLDER
Line_5307	THEY UM GO DOWN IN UM TEMPE
Line_5308	I STAND EXACT
Line_5309	SORRY I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU REPEAT
Line_5310	I NEED STAR BOURS BURST SOR
Line_5311	UM IT CHANGED REALLY QUICKLY I GUESS
Line_5312	WE DREW IT ON GRAPH PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE TO UM
Line_5314	LE X'S OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WELL YOU PUT ON IT TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UP UP ALL THE WAY UP
Line_5317	HOW MUCH TIME HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY DOING GOOD
Line_5319	IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES AND THEN UP
Line_5321	IT GOT IT WAS STARTED AT TWENTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MUCH I GUESS BY FIVES OR
Line_5323	JUST BY COUNTING BY TENS OR FIFTY
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF IT'S WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IF IT'S HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY'RE DIFFERENT UM TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE IN THE UM T
Line_5328	GOODBYE I'M REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT GOODBYE
Line_5329	HELLO MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH RULERS YARDSTICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
Line_5332	WE WERE MEASURING UM OUR DESK AND WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT THE PERIMETER OF IT
Line_5333	I USED A YARDSTICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DESK
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH THOSE AND I THINK THEY'RE STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YARDSTICK OR A RULER THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVEN NO IT IS TEN DEC
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DEC DECIMETERS IN A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WE MEASURED THE CAMPA CAPACITY OF A CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE CAPACITY
Line_5346	WE USED UM THE CAPACITY OR
Line_5347	YOU COULD POUR IT IN A DIFFERENT CUP OR A GRADUATED CYLINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLI MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PRETTY MUCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACITY CAPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP OR A WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	THE CUP THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5354	YOU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER IN THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S YOUR IT'S HOW IT'S THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSELS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS IN CAPACITY
Line_5357	THE TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE CAMPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER
Line_5361	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH CAM WHAT THE CAMPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE CAMPCITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITER DIFFERENCE IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLUME AND THE CAMPACITY ARE THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENCE
Line_5367	THE CAMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLUME
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAMPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5369	THE CAMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VOLUME OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LITERS AND A S THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLILITERS
Line_5372	THAT TELLS YOU THAT MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_5373	IT'S LABLED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDERED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE MMM THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THE ELS
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINUTE
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARM
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY AT THE UP UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE IN JUST A MINUTE
Line_5380	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT ST UP HIGH AND THEN IT GOES ALL PRETTY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOWLY MAKES IT'S WAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRAPH THEN IT GETS WARMER
Line_5382	I NOTICED THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FULLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	OURS IT WENT FROM TWENTY ALL THE WAY TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND LENGTH AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO AND THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
Line_5389	TO FIGURE OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UM THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND DES
Line_5396	UM NO
Line_5397	THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM A HIGHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM DANGIT I JUST FOR
Line_5400	WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NO I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE THE NOTCHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF
Line_5404	WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	THIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BOTH ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N NET THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOMETIMES
Line_5415	THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY'RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START T START RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT WILL START GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE SINCE YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU J D HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T START WORKING
Line_5446	ALL THE RIGHT PLACES IN THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	INK THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINUS PLACE AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE ON THE PLUS PLACE SO IT WILL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT EM
Line_5450	TODAY I MADE POSTERS PEACE POSTERS
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPER IN THE MIDDLE AND THE MAGNET BELOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS ON ON THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY IN THE M M IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONE
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TODAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PEACE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PEACE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THOSE OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WAR IS BAD TOO BUT PEACE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE P POSTERS A FOR PEACE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHTBULB SO THE LIGHTBULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS IT THE IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	CAUSE IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH SO THE LIGHTBULB WILL LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL THE ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING IN ON A BATTERY THE BATTERY WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINUS
Line_5465	WELL SINCE I CLICKED ON THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL I I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	C OR A B OR C D
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BATTERY WIRE AND A LIGHTBULB WITH THE LIGHTBULB KIT
Line_5469	AND A AND B AND AFTER YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT WE HA WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TWO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE'VE BEEN MAKING S THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR E THE LAST TIME THE LAST TIM WE HAD SCIENCE WE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPIN
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHTBULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HA UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHTBULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THEN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE WITH ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIAGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE UM DONE IN CLASS
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAVE A PLACE TO GO
Line_5479	THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	H HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHTBULBS WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT IT'S GOING OUT OF IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL S CURRENT WOULD GO IN A OPP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL F CURRENT WOULD F FLOW THROUGH LEFT UH NO FLOW TO THE LEFT
Line_5486	WE PUT EM IN THE CUP EITHER BY DROPPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPPED EM ON THE RIM OF THE CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
Line_5487	TIL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT WHAT'S THAT CALLED WHAT'S THAT CALLED
Line_5488	AMOUNT OF WEIGHT BREAKS THE MAGNETIC WAVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC WHAT ARE THEY CALLED
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WAVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS IN BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURNS THE ELECTROMAGNET ON AND OFF
Line_5492	UM I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINDS IT HAS UM THE MORE THE MORE THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY IN THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT THE ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	UM W IT IT BUZZED IS AND AND PART OF IT SPUN AROUND IN CIRCLES
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU BY A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF THE LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY'S CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ON IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON AND OFF
Line_5499	THE ENERGY FROM IT YOU CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTOR OR A LIGHT RUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY IS UH CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TURN ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE AND AND GOES INTO AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULB
Line_5502	UM UH WHEN WA TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UM IT MAKES IT SO THAT THERE'S ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT IN A CIRCLE
Line_5505	UH NO WE RUBBED A PAPER CLIP ON A MAGNET AND THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5507	UM IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN START PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO MOVE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN'T DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT TO DROP IT YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLD US BUT UM YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE'S TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS A G I D I JUST DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAP
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FAST TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE THE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	BECAUSE IT'S STILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM WHAT DO YOU EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAID IT JUST SWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTOR'S FLAP RUNS
Line_5522	INSTEAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT'LL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEIGHT TO LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
Line_5525	WHY DO YOU WANNA DO IT LIKE
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS A WHAT'S IT CALLED A
Line_5529	WAIT WHAT'S IT CALLED PARA
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	UM DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND IT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	THIS IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT SAYS ENABLE HARDWARE ACCELERATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY S THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICED THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERIES THEY YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	CAN'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD THAT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE AND ONE HAD I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL CAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE P UM ELECTRICITY CANNOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULB'S BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
Line_5548	I THINK IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNETS
Line_5550	AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOX AND TAPE IT THEN USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS COPPER
Line_5552	AND UM SOME I FOR
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM CAUSE OTHER GROUPS HID EM SOMEWHERE IN THE CARDBOARD BOX AND WE TRIED TO FIND IT
Line_5554	WELL WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPASS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX SO THEN WE SEARCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	THE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_5556	THERE'S METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THE ME A METAL OR UM LIKE A S ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO F E SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER UM MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TECHNICALLY FINDS UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIND METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WITH MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUP
Line_5561	BY USING LIKE A NAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOX AND FIND IT TIL IT S FEELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY UM STICK TO CERTAIN KINDS
Line_5563	WELL IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHEREVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NO IT DID NOT IT JUST UM KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLATE
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5566	THE ME THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LEAD INSIDE THE PENCIL
Line_5567	YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEY'RE NOT AS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT AS STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER CAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUITE SURE
Line_5571	I THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MA A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I THINK AND THE
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON AND TURNS OFFTTU
Line_5575	IT'S IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO UM MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD THIS UM PLAY AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UH UM WHAT
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE CAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	THE ENERGY F UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	UH WE PUT IT UNDER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY OPINION I I I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE THING INSIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THESE LITTLE SYMBOLS AND WE SAW UM IN A KEY AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH WHAT THE BATTERY WAS AND THE LIGHT BULB AND ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	E UM THE DRAWINGS RELATE BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED BUT IT GOES AWAY FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	UM IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE A LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY IN THIS SLOT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TOO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE NA THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HOOKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLATE
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HOOKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN'T GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE OR ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL ONTO THE PLATE
Line_5602	UM WELL AND SINCE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE WAS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THEY ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICED THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT AT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO THE OTHER ONE AND COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE F IT THE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE'S UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS THESE SYMBOLS AND IT THE WRONG DISC
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM I'M NOT S QUITE SURE
Line_5616	WE MADE A MAGNET THAT CAN S TURN OFF AND ON
Line_5617	ER WAIT WHAT
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE POW UM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE THE RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAD TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NOTHING'S HAPPENING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAG THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS UM A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I'M NOT SO QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S A SPECIAL METAL BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIED THAT AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE'S NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE USE JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I'M CORRECT IT'S JUST IN MY OPINION
Line_5629	WELL IF ER THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WE ALSO JUST WAIT I FORGET IT
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIED UM THE WIRE TOUCHING INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
Line_5632	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVETS SO THEN IT CAN'T PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE ASKED FOR HELP FROM MR MARCINI AND HE TOLD US TRY WRAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT UM THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM ON ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE L MAKE THE LIGHTS TURN ON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FORM OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGHT MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THEN YOU WILL NEED MORE YOUR
Line_5641	NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE MMM NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	ES YOU CAN STILL MAKE UM A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGHTER THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN IN THE WRONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE IN
Line_5648	IN THE WRONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE NE
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I TH I YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WOULD WORK TOO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BO UM THE
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRE SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5657	THEN IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL M TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THEY'RE
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE A SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	UM SO THE NE SO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME WA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5662	UM YES IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	MMM NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THIS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAINST
Line_5670	YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CANNOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORKWITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YES SCIENCE IS VERY COOL
Line_5674	UM WE'RE SEEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	CHIPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHER'S GOING INTO A CUP SEE IF IT UNHOOKS THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	UM IT'S SEEING HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UNHOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	THAT IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY'RE BEING DETACHED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY'RE BEING DETRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PRESS THE ORANGE WASHER THE ONE WASHER JUST SEPARATES THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GRAPHS WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YES IT DOES TELL US
Line_5686	WASHERS IS TAKES TO BREAK THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHERS IT TAKES TO BREAK THE FORCE
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHERS THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_5689	I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HAD THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UPRIGHT IT SPUN
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BATTERY THE BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DID IN SCIENCE WHERE WE USED UM THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HA
Line_5697	I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE THAT WHATEVER'S IN HERE IS THIS A LIGHT BULB AT TH
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A UH S IT L IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A SQUARE RIGHT NOW
Line_5700	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY I THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPENING
Line_5704	NO IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT AT THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND A PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	THAT THE MAGNET CAN GO THROUGH THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT COULD GO THROUGH
Line_5708	YES I HAVE ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5709	UM WE BUILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEWHERE WHERE WE DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT
Line_5710	WHEN IT THE METAL SHAVINGS FOUND THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE UM A MAGNET'S ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF A THIN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARDBOARD
Line_5713	UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIGHER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	THERE'S SOMETHING BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNETS IT'LL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT'S STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STAYS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNET'S THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE ON AND OFF SWITCH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON AND OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ON AND OFF SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR'S NOT GONNA RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR WILL RUN
Line_5721	IF THE MOTOR'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRE'S AREN'T CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DID WE DO I FOR
Line_5723	IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	IF YOU WOULD PUT BOTH WIRES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SINCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCHING UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM YEAH CAUSE WE TRIED THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED
Line_5731	UM NO ALUMINUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	NO THE WAY WE DID IT IS OUR SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UNCONNECTS UNCONNECTS IT SO THE ELECTROMAGNET CANNOT SO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5734	CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET UM IT'LL GO THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE OF THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	THE ELECTRICITY'S FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	POWER IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS WAS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	UM THE REASON IT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT STARTED TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH THE NA UM THE ELECTRICITY'S GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MORNING IN SCIENCE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP UM WASHERS VERY EASILY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT IT MAKES THE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5748	INSULATION MEANS LIKE THE COPPER WIRE IS INSIDE OF THE GREEN COATING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN ON A SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS DOES STAYS MAGNETIC
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERYTIME I CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN'T TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN'T THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I OBSERVE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CANNOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NO WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON A CERTAIN SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LET'S GO APART
Line_5760	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WILL UM A THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN 'EM
Line_5762	ROCK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL IN THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL NAIL HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL IS ALUNIMUM ALUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE A BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPEALING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POOLS ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING APART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGANETS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	YOU KIND OF SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK T FOR UH THE MAGNET T TISE THE MAGNETS TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THE NINETEEN WASHERS UM BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TOO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROBABLY SEPARATE QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACES IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FORCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASH
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACE IS TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACES IN YOU GET A HIGHER NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACES IN YOU GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
Line_5776	YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND UM JUST SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND BE CREATIVE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF EL ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THEY'RE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	UM I FORGET ITS NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN S AND IT USES SYMBOLS TO TELL YOU INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE DETAILS
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	THIS SHOWS YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN'T RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NEW WIRES
Line_5785	YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TODAY WE DID THIS FUN MYSTERY THING WITH FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	THERE ARE NO WIRES CONNECTED TO B
Line_5788	HI MY NAME IS JONAH
Line_5789	HI MY NAME IS JONAH WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS
Line_5790	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM IN SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORK
Line_5791	WELL THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BRAD ON A AND THE BRA AND THE ONE ON D
Line_5792	WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECT KEEPS THE IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRADS THAT THE WIRES ATTACHED TO OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
Line_5794	WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORK
Line_5795	UM THE CONDUCTORS
Line_5796	WELL GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UM WORK
Line_5797	WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTACHED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD BY A WIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
Line_5798	WELL THAT SHOWS THAT UM THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD ARE CONNECTED FROM A AND C
Line_5799	WELL A CIRCUIT IS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S UM MAKING SOMETHING WORK
Line_5800	UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU JUST ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
Line_5801	UM THE BAT UM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5802	UM WELL JUST M MORE ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIGHT UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5803	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5804	I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5805	UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5806	WELL E WELL IT'S ALWAYS COMING IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE INTO THE INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5807	WELL IT ALWAYS COMES IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5808	IT UM IT ALWAYS FLOWS OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND ALWAYS COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5809	WELL IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY FROM THE PLUS SIDE SO YEAH
Line_5810	WELL IF THE B CUP IF IT'S TOO HEAVY IN THE B CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THEN IT'LL BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5811	UM IF YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER IN OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
Line_5812	WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FORCE IS PRETTY STRONG
Line_5813	WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAK THE FORCE
Line_5814	THEY'RE GETTING SPREAD APART
Line_5815	THE DISTANCE INCREASES
Line_5816	THE MAGNETIC FORCE SLOWLY WEAKENS UNTIL IT'S NOT MAGNETI UNTIL IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5817	WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO SPACES ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE
Line_5818	GROUP A GROUP B GROUP D THEY ALL GOT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT GROUP C JUST KIND OF THREW THEIR WASHERS IN IN BAD ORDER
Line_5819	WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5820	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING S UH THIS CIRCUIT IT IS ONE BATTERY AND IT'S POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT ONCE
Line_5821	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5822	AND UH YEAH
Line_5823	WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAS ONE
Line_5824	EACH WA EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_5825	YEAH EACH COMPONENT HAS THEIR OWN PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE OR THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5826	WELL THE BULB IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5827	WELL UM THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5828	WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN UH PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5829	TWO PATHWAYS I THINK
Line_5830	THIS REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5831	IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5832	THAT UM THERE'S MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PA
Line_5833	WELL UM THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
Line_5834	UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S PROBABLY A MAGNET IN IT
Line_5835	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE UM MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAY IT'S GOING
Line_5836	WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISM IS UH LIKE WHAT THE FILINGS ARE GETTING PULLED TO
Line_5837	UH I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM CORNER
Line_5838	THE PAPER CLIP FLIES TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS IS PULLING IT IN
Line_5839	UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND AS YOU DO IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
Line_5840	WELL WHEN YOU GET BY TO THE MAGNET IT'LL START POINTING REAL HARD THEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING AT IT SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MAGNET
Line_5841	WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WORK LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5842	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP AROUND THE CORE THE UM THE STRONGER THE THE UH MAGNET WILL BE
Line_5843	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5844	THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_5845	WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AN IRON CORE IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP UM LIKE WASHERS
Line_5846	UM WELL UH I'M NOT SURE
Line_5847	THE UM CORE WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE UH WASHERS
Line_5848	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
Line_5849	WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW SO THE UM THE CIRCUIT THE AND THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5850	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT WILL PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5851	IF THE UM S UM SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL OP THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
Line_5852	UM THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT UM THE ELECTROMAGNET WORKS
Line_5853	WELL THE CORE'S MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO FOLLOW THE M UH WASHERS AWAY
Line_5854	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED AROUND IT AND IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5855	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5856	WELL WE HAD A LATTER A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE A L AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_5857	WELL YOU HAVE TO USE IT UM THE D CELL TO GET THE UH ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5858	IT PRETTY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN SPIN AROUND THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_5859	I THINK THE REASON IT'S UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IT IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOURCE USED BY A LIGHT BULB
Line_5860	WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GUIDE IT THEY GO THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GUIDES IT THROUGH
Line_5861	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULB LIGHT
Line_5862	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_5863	ELECTRICITY
Line_5864	I'M NOT SURE WHAT CONTACT POINTS ARE
Line_5865	UM YOU CONNECTED 'EM TO EACH CONTACT POINT AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
Line_5866	WELL UH WELL UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THE SIDE
Line_5867	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5868	WELL A D CELL GIVES THE UM GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
Line_5869	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
Line_5870	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING THERE SO IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
Line_5871	UM THE CIRCUIT UM UM IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STARTS UP UP AGAIN
Line_5872	WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PART WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE FLAG SO THE FLAG'S SPINNING AROUND
Line_5873	UM THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_5874	IT'S MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_5875	UM IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING LIT
Line_5876	LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING ATTACHED TO THE CONTACT POINT SO IT'S GETTING LIT
Line_5877	UM THERE'S A MOTOR AT THE BOTTOM
Line_5878	H UM IT HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND A CORE
Line_5879	WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE CORE MORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BATTERIES IN
Line_5880	UM THAT'S SHOWING THAT WE PUT ONE HUNDRED WINDS THEN IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5881	ONE HUNDRED MI WINDS MEANS IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5882	WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5883	UM IF YOU UN IF IT'S NOT AS WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
Line_5884	THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5885	WELL THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AROUND THE CORE THE MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5886	WELL THE UM THE MORE WINDS YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5887	WELL ONE WAY TO STRENGTHEN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINDS AROUND A LOT MORE TIMES
Line_5888	ER YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES
Line_5889	UM SOME OF THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY
Line_5890	UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST INC KEEP INCREASING THE MORE WASHERS YOU ER I MEAN THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT
Line_5891	BECAUSE THE MORE UM IT'S TOUCH THE MORE IT'S BY TO ELECTRICITY THE ER THE BIGGER THE UM THE MAGNETIC FIELD IT IS
Line_5892	IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD BIGGER
Line_5893	WELL ER THE MORE UM WIRE WRAPS YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THE MORE ER WASHERS
Line_5894	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT LIKE THE MORE ER WRAPS YOU DO THE ER MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5895	WELL THE MORE ER WRAPS THAT YOU DO THE ER HIGHER THE GRAPH GET UM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WHERE THE WASHERS ARE
Line_5896	UM THE FARTHER YOU GO TO THE RIGHT IT IT INCREASES TEN WRAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIGHER
Line_5897	WELL WHEN THE NUMBER OF WRAPS GET LARGER THE UM THE DATA THE UM WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP
Line_5898	THEY'RE ER INCREASING UM HOW MUCH UM PICK UP
Line_5899	WELL THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU GET THE MORE WASHERS WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5900	WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP THAT MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THE WHEN ITS NOT AS STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
Line_5901	IT MEANS IT'S STRONGER
Line_5902	BECAUSE ER NINETY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE BOTH FIFTEEN WRAPS
Line_5903	WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCTOR IT IS
Line_5904	AN OPENS C WAIT AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_5905	WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKE IT SPIN
Line_5906	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5907	WELL IF YOU HAVE AN INSULATOR THE MOTOR'S NOT GONNA WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONDUCTOR THE UM MOTOR WIS RUN
Line_5908	WELL WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO IT IT WILL JUST STOP WORKING
Line_5909	WELL SOME TYPES OF METALS STICK TO MAGNETS BUT NO UM PLASTIC WILL
Line_5910	WELL WELL THE NAIL ON THE RIGHT IS A STEEL NAIL AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS ALUMINUM AND S STEEL STICKS TO MAG MAGNETS BUT NOT ALUMINUM
Line_5911	WELL THOSE ARE STEEL AND UM IRON THEY WILL STICK TO AN A MAGNET AND CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_5912	WELL WE'VE BEEN BUILDING CIRCUITS
Line_5913	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIRES ARE IN THE LITTLE BOARD IT'S A PRETTY COOL EXPERIMENT
Line_5914	THERE'S THERE'S A WIRE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT D
Line_5915	WELL IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT FROM THIS SET UP
Line_5916	WELL HERE WE HAVE A BATTERY WIRES
Line_5917	WELL THE WIRE MUST BE FROM GOING TH THE WIRE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD MUST BE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT B
Line_5918	YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE BRADS DON'T YOU
Line_5919	THEY'RE CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
Line_5920	THEY'RE MADE OF METAL AND ARE GOOD CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
Line_5921	YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE WIRES TO THE BRADS THAT ARE CONNECTING THE WIRE
Line_5922	THIS WOULD BE A CLOSED OR COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_5923	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5924	ENOUGH SO I'M NOT SURE
Line_5925	I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I CAN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THAT
Line_5926	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DIDN'T OBSERVE THE THICK STACK
Line_5927	IT'S PROBABLY NOT BE BEING ABLE TO UM ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP VERY WELL SO THE PAPER CLIP IS JUST FALLING OFF
Line_5928	IRON AND STEEL UM CAN ATTRACT A MAGNET
Line_5929	DON'T REALLY KNOW I'M STUMPED
Line_5930	THE NAIL MUST HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY TURNED INTO A MAGNET SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5931	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5932	THROUGH A PATHWAY TO A RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN
Line_5933	WELL THE PATHWAY IS A CONDUCTOR OR A WIRE
Line_5934	A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE OF ELECTRICITY BASICALLY
Line_5935	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRONS AND THERE ARE ONLY LIKE THREE OF THEM IN THE LIGHT BULB AT A TIME
Line_5936	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE
Line_5937	IT'S FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5938	WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING FASTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER
Line_5939	THE ENERGY IS GOING FASTER
Line_5940	THE LIGHT BULBS GLOW BRIGHTER
Line_5941	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER
Line_5942	THE BULBS LIGHT UP BRIGHTER SO IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL YOU GET MORE LIGHT
Line_5943	WELL WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE D CELL THE
Line_5944	WELL PLUS IS AGAINST PLUS AND MINUS IS POINTING OUT
Line_5945	WELL WHEN YOU ADD MORE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5946	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS ABOUT TWO TIMES FASTER
Line_5947	THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5948	THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5949	WELL IN THIS SHCEMATIC THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5950	WELL UH BYE
Line_5951	UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COOL
Line_5952	IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
Line_5953	WELL IN THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE PULL OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5954	WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC PULL BECOMES WEAKER
Line_5955	WELL THE RESULTS WERE DIFFERENT RIGHT
Line_5956	NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE
Line_5957	GOOD HOW HOW ARE YOU
Line_5958	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5959	I THINK YOU'VE MADE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5960	WELL WHEN YOU ROLL OVER THE LIGHT BULB THE UH WIRES UM GLOW GREEN
Line_5961	THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS FLOWS FROM THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5962	IT GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS OR POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5963	EACH SYMBOL REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB A BAT
Line_5964	IT REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BASICALLY
Line_5965	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE
Line_5966	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MEANS THE RECEIVERS EACH HAVE A SEPARATE PATHWAY TO THE BATTERY
Line_5967	THERE'S ONE FOR EACH RECEIVER
Line_5968	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5969	THERE'S A MAGNET INSIDE THE MYSTERY BOX SO THAT'S WHY IT'S S SO MYSTERIOUS
Line_5970	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO IRON
Line_5971	WELL THE MAGNETIC POLES OF THE MAGNET UH YOU SEE THE MAGNETIC POLES OF THAT MAGNET THE POLES ON THE MAGNET UM OH GEE WHIZ HOW DO I PUT THIS LET'S SEE SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WHEN YOU PUT THE PAPER CLIP BY TO IT UM
Line_5972	GREAT HOW ARE Y HOW'S YOURSELF
Line_5973	WE'VE BEEN UH MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5974	ELECTRICITY I CAN'T EXPLAIN VERY WELL
Line_5975	BECAUSE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THERE'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5976	YOU TWIST IT AROUND A CORE
Line_5977	WELL IF YOU HA WRAPPED THE CORE WITH WIRE A MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED
Line_5978	WELL THE SWITCH HAS TO BE UM CONNECTING THE TWO WIRE CLIPS
Line_5979	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE SWITCH IS ON
Line_5980	ELECTRICITY MUST BE IN A CIRCUIT OR FLOW IN A CIRCLE
Line_5981	AND MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED PICKING UP WASHERS
Line_5982	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE COMPONENT THAT UH
Line_5983	THE SWITCH PLAYS THE ROLE OF CIRCUIT BREAKER IN THIS ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5984	THEY ARE CONNECTED BY A WIRE A K A A PATHWAY
Line_5985	WELL THE ROLE OF A SWITCH IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS UM
Line_5986	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5987	IRON THE CORE HAS TO BE MADE OF
Line_5988	YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE CORE IS ALWAYS IRON
Line_5989	THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5990	WELL IT'S A BATTERY TWO WIRES A LIGHT AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5991	GOOD HOW ARE YO HOW IS YOURSELF
Line_5992	WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5993	WELL ONCE THE D CELL BATTERY UM THERE'RE TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5994	THEY'RE WHAT GENERATES THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS AROUND IN THE CIRCLE
Line_5995	I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU MORE ABOUT IT
Line_5996	WELL IT MEANS
Line_5997	A D CELL AND A SWITCH
Line_5998	THIS COMPONENT IS CALLED THE MOTOR OR RECEIVER
Line_5999	WELL IT'S THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY FOR THIS WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_6000	WELL THE D CELL ER THE D CELL WELL THE D CELL SENDS THIS THE GIVES OFF THE ELECTRICAL SPARK
Line_6001	THE WIRES
Line_6002	WHEN IT'S CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT
Line_6003	WELL YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY THEN TRANSMIT IT THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE BACK TO THE SOURCE
Line_6004	WELL THE CIRCUIT CAN'T BE BROKEN BY A SWITCH
Line_6005	UM CAN'T REALLY
Line_6006	A WHITE BULB
Line_6007	IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB
Line_6008	WELL IT REPRESENTS A MOTOR
Line_6009	IT SHOWS A A CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH IN IT A SWITCH OR A CIRCUIT BREAKER
Line_6010	THEY ARE UM MAGNETS POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
Line_6011	IT MUST BE A COMPLETE OR CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6012	WELL YOU JUST WIND THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE TIMES
Line_6013	IT MEANS THE WIRE THE WIRE HAS GONE A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE CORE
Line_6014	WELL THERE ARE TEN WA THERE ARE TEN WINDS HERE IT ONLY PICKS UP THREE WASHERS
Line_6015	WIND UM WIND THE WIRE AROUND THE
Line_6016	THE NUMBER OF WASHERS YOU PICK UP GOES UP
Line_6017	WELL THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6018	THE MAGNETIC FIELD CREATED BY THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GETS STRONGER WITH THE MORE WRAPS YOU HAVE
Line_6019	THE ELECTRICITY IS CREATING A STRONGER MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_6020	I WOULD DISPLAY MY DA DATA UM
Line_6021	BY RECORDING THE NUMBER OF WRAPS AND THE NUMBER OF WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_6022	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU HAVE THERE ARE MORE WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP
Line_6023	I THINK AGAIN THAT IT WOULD PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6024	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_6025	WELL THIS IS A CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH IN IT
Line_6026	THE BRASS RING IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_6027	NO NOT ALL OBJECT WORK THE SAME SOME OBJECTS ARE CONDUCTORS OTHERS ARE INSULATORS
Line_6028	WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_6029	IT DOESN'T SPIN
Line_6030	WELL UM IRON AND STEEL ARE
Line_6031	THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL METAL LIKE BRASS OR SILVER OR COPPER METAL IRON STEEL ALUMINUM
Line_6032	WELL THERE ARE TWO CERTAIN METALS THAT ATTRACT MAGNENTS IRON AND STEEL

Line_0	I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CONNETIC ENERGIES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DIVISE OR LIGHT BULBS SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK I NEVER MIND
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_7	CONNETIC ENERGY AND AN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND THE LIKE IT
Line_10	ONE NEG THE OF A T UM
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE T SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING THE UP OF COLE
Line_14	EARRY OF THE IT
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_16	THIS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT THE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES BASING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THIS THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY OBSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE IS THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORBE ENERGY FROM THE UM AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGIES
Line_25	WE METAL OR A COPPER OR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUMKIE STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING TOUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE WERE IT'S NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE PAPE THE S THE WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT A METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT WE JUST ESTABLISHED IN IT
Line_30	MAD OF MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THEN NADE NEADS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN MADE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	ILLITERS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL A TALL
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CON CONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE NOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAXIS ME
Line_38	THE WICK WHICH IS THE THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SEND LIKE ANYTHING
Line_40	IS BEARNING AND FLAMING AND
Line_41	UM USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS IN GOING ON A HITCHCK BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	UM THUS PRODUCING OFF GIVING ET ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HERE SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT
Line_44	IT ALL IS WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS A KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	WILL BEARN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UN LESS IT IS THE SOLAR POWER CAL
Line_47	IT WILL COMPUT THE SUN TO THE SOLAR POWNDOR TO THE SOLAR ENERGY D CELL AND IT WILL GOT THAT TRANSFERING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	OKAY UM WE SKIP THIS
Line_49	NON REUSABLE
Line_50	IT IS ONLY UH ONE TIME USE AND COAL IS JUST AND CALL IT'S IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONG TIME
Line_51	THEEARY WILL NOT GETTING YEAI I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	DON'T GETS AND WE DON'T GET
Line_54	I DO THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS A CUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT'S GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S VERY BAD IT CAN'T
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IT IS RELY COMPROCATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICAL WAY
Line_59	R ER OR BE ER CAN COMPLUCATE AH
Line_60	THAT'S I DO NOT KNOW FER
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	OKAY I DON'T KNOWTHE PATHS ARE GOING IN
Line_65	IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
Line_66	EL NO AS
Line_67	NOW
Line_68	I AMER BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPERCONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	UH I AN DON'T NO
Line_73	UM SOARY AND BISY AND I DON'T WEIGH HAVE TIME FOR A
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BISY REALLY BISY YEAH
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE LEST
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINIUM WHITCH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS ALUMINIM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END
Line_78	I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE TO LET ME HURRY UP
Line_79	STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS
Line_80	I'M COLOR BLIN I'M COLOR BLINE SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH IS GRAY
Line_81	MATALLIC I IUMS
Line_82	THEY ARE VARYMETIC AND VARY MATALLIC
Line_83	MAGNETS
Line_84	THEY WOULD REPEL OBVIES LIKE
Line_85	UH I
Line_86	ITS SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
Line_87	THEY ARE SIMILAR B IT ALL NEVER MIND CAN WE MOVE ON
Line_88	SOME ARE REPELLING SOME ARE ATTRACTING AND THEN THE STRAR DEL THINK YOU VERY MUCH
Line_89	A PERSON WITH THE COMPASS
Line_90	BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISED
Line_91	IT IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_92	BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
Line_93	BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE IT PULLES AND UP SO IT PULLS ATTRACT
Line_94	MAGNET IT'S HARD FOR MAGNETISOM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK
Line_95	IT IS NOT STICKING
Line_96	BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_97	THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
Line_98	METAL AND MAGNETISM

Line_134	RAPIDIS TE
Line_135	A THING
Line_136	I'M GOOD TO DAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT SORTS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	FER WIRES AND THEY TRO THEY TRANS FOR ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UM TO LIGHT THE BATTERY TO NO TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE WE CAN JUST LIKE A LIGHT BULB WITH OUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY AND A CIRCUIT B
Line_141	THEY TRANS FORD ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMS INTO LIGHT IN
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IS GETTING SUCKED BY THE POSIT
Line_146	THE ENERGY FLOW TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REP ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BOTH WEIGHTS EVEN THO D THE SIDES ARE SWITCH
Line_149	I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASING AND THE BULB CAP
Line_151	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES
Line_152	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE MOTORS
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED FROM SORED ENERGY TO CONETIC ENERG
Line_155	IT COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	THE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BORD
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECT ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FASING THE SUN LIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SO SHELLS COLLECT
Line_165	WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T
Line_167	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THERE IS WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENUFH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT OF THE
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THINGS
Line_171	A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
Line_172	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
Line_173	ALL METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_174	ALL OF THE METALS AND THE LIST ARE CONDUCT ARE TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_175	ALL METALS CONNECT ELECTRICITY
Line_176	THE CIRCUIT RUNS
Line_177	I MAKE A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_178	ALL ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_179	A CIRCUIT WITH THE INSULATOR INSULATES ELECTRICITY THERE FOR THE INSULATOR THE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_180	INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METALS THERE FOR THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_181	THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_182	WHEN I ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
Line_183	CLOSED
Line_184	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_185	THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
Line_186	GOOD
Line_187	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHA HOW EN ENERGY IS PRESANT
Line_188	IT IT POWERS THINGS LIKES TOSTLIER THAN COMPUTORS
Line_189	I SEE THE CANDLE BEARNING AND THE WAS MELTING
Line_190	THER CAN THE MOUNTS
Line_191	IT FELT VERY HOT
Line_192	THEY HAD NO SOWND
Line_193	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL TEN ENERGY SOURCES
Line_194	POWERS EVERYTHING FROM FARCE TO COSTURS
Line_195	I SEE THE CANL BEARNING AND THE MAXWELL MELTING
Line_196	THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THERE FOR THE AXIS MELTING
Line_197	THERE IS NO SOUNDS
Line_198	SINCE THE PERSON IS PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUMS IS MAKING SOWND
Line_199	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THERE FOR SHE O ED ENERGY FROM THE APPLE TO EAT
Line_200	CANDLE APPLES WOOD IT STICKS GO IN THE FELD

Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO MUGO THROUGH MANYMORE WIRES
Line_221	HORCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES
Line_222	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE THE POLES
Line_224	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER

Line_261	IT'S NOT A UH OH A
Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTOR
Line_263	THEY'RE COMPONENTS AND A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRE
Line_264	THES HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWERS
Line_265	IF THE D CELL ARE ANT THEY'RE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EAVINENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANS OR AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILLMANT AND THEY'RE GETS SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_277	EN THE ELECTRARAMS FLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_279	WELL IF YOU FLIP T I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULBBLS STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT PINT WOULD NOT GET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN IT OFF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	INCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT UM SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IS HAPINING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THE BAT THE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSFER ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS SEEING TRANSFERD THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT PAIN
Line_289	TRY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	IT STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	THE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUN LIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR SHELL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR FOR TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS BECAUSE NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	MIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SUMMER CONDUCTORS SUMMER INSULATORS
Line_306	ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE UM THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UM IF YOU PUT AN INSULLATORUM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE SPOPSICAL SIT DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	INSULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS TRY TO ACT LIKE AND LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NOW ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	OTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_313	THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY LIGHTING LIKE A PATHWAY
Line_314	ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS INTO MOTION OR LIGHT OR SAL
Line_315	YEAH CANDLE BERNING SET
Line_316	UH BEARNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO SEE WAX MELTING
Line_317	SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING S CAN A SISL
Line_318	THE HEAT IS MIN FROM THE THE WICK AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
Line_319	IT IS FLIKERING GIVING OFF HEAT AND MAKING WIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A MER SOME KIND A NOISE THE THAT SAYS ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE DRUM TO MAKE IT RELEASE A SOUND
Line_322	WELL THE PERSONS BEARNING CALORIES WALKING UP A MOUNTIN
Line_323	WOOD GASS FOED AND CANDLES
Line_324	IT WILL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND THE EVEN WATER
Line_325	WE IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL THE ENVIRONMENT LE
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I AM NOT SHURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH EMVIRONMENTALLY FRENLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUT DOOR THING
Line_330	THEY WILL PULLUTH THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CREALLY SMOG
Line_331	THEY POLL THE ERTH LUSL OR PANELS DO NOT PULL UP THE ERTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLO
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUME DOS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT THERE IS NOT ENOFF ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE IS MORE POWER TO LET THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FASCE THE THE SAME POLARY
Line_344	YOU PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSIT
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WAS AND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEN FLOWS IN TWO WAGS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S ON PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULB
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED AND THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS RIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BAD THEN THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE OF THE
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THERE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BERRUNS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF UM THE THE FILLIMENS IS BURNED UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALL OF THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILLIMENT IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TWO
Line_368	A FILIMENT BRATES AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN THE BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW STOPS
Line_370	THE FILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORK IT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT SO YOU CAN EASALLY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAR AND AND IT STAYS ON
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BERNCT WHICH IS LIKE AND OPEN
Line_375	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND PATHWAYS
Line_376	WELL UM
Line_377	THE FILLIMEN BROK SO UM SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S A SERY
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILM IT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRCUIT LIKE AN OPEN SWIT
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARND HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S ETHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON A NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	OKAY SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NOW IRON IN IT OR AN AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DAS
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOFTHING BECAUSE IT IT'S IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL ONE IT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	I THINK IT'S ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EN TO WHAT HAPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A WRACKT
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGENST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGENST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THE BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSED TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPRESS SHOWING NORTH ON THE ERTH
Line_402	SOMEONE USING A COMPRESS TO FU WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FALLS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTED METAL THAT IS STEEP INSIDE THE ERTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRO
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPOST POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MO
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TO THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE MAGNET PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSE FOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THE LEAN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZES EVERYTHING AS A TEMPORRARY MAGNET
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BREAKING WITH WEIGHT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN STA
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENUFF ATTRACTION FORCE BECAUSE IT IS TO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AWAY
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKANS THE MAGNETIC F
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	AND IT MAKES THE FORCE WEA
Line_427	WELL THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DIS
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACE
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAKE THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WROP THE CORD WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZES THE COLE
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETING TOT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHITCH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAIN IGE BECAUSE ELECTROMAGNETS USE A TON OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE THE SWITCH MAKES SHURE OF IT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER
Line_438	IT MAGNETIZES THE COAL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COIL TO MAGNETISE IT
Line_440	THE THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THAT COILETO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	IT HAVE TO BE RAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETISE THE RIVET
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	BOTH THESE ARE WIYE RES
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB FLIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
Line_448	IT IS A SOR
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	BUT THE WIRES ARE A PATHERAY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
Line_455	I JUST CARRY ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY LIGHT AN THESE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE BULB LIGHT
Line_458	IT
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	TIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_461	IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS TA BUM ON IT
Line_462	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY PROENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRIC THE FLOW GOES THE ER WAY
Line_466	UH JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOUS
Line_467	CTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AND I NO THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES AND THE HAN IN ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	I DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH AND THIS PIXTURE IS AND
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT IT'S THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR SITS RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL LOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR SITS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THEY ACHING ANY AND
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I CRICK ON IT GA
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR STOP THE MOTOR RATS SPINNING
Line_492	SOLAR SALT DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR IT WILL NOT R
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR STAND
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANELS
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS STUDYING
Line_498	THE NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPER CLIP BRIGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPICAL STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	UM MEAL
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSED I SO IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WEEVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	I THINK THAT UM THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE MAX THE WAX IS MOUNTED
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAXIS NON
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT HAIN
Line_517	I SEE A FLAME
Line_518	ITS IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	UM SOMEONE IS DRUMMING
Line_520	SHEE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEAR IT UM YEA
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHEE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WA
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFFLD
Line_525	THERE GETS THERE GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	HOKAY
Line_528	UM THE SOLAR THE ARE NOSE
Line_529	STUFF
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NON RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTDED
Line_532	UM THE COAL GASSPROLUTS THE AIR
Line_533	CO AN GASSWOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	UM THE ELECTRICITY IS GLOWING AND IT IS CLOSE
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN STOP
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND A ST CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULB
Line_541	YOUR ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_542	LU DOT THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY S HELP THE ELECTRICITY FLO
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERYW DO
Line_544	ONE
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WE'LL MEAN MORE WIRES
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET RIGHT TO E
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT R
Line_548	YEAH THAT THOSE RIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT TO AN RIDES
Line_549	I SEE THAT
Line_550	THEY HOW YOU A THE POST LADY IN THE W
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	ET
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULB WILL BE BED ER
Line_556	BOISE GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE C THE POSITIVE MOUNT THAT ER IS NOT
Line_557	THAT IS VALY BECAUSE IT RACTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES AND THROUGH THE THEY AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE ELS READ
Line_559	THERE ARE TO PATH W
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAY
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THE VERY QUIL
Line_562	NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_563	THEY ARE A BRIY TIN
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IF IT DOESN'T GO A THO ONLY GOES ON Y E E
Line_565	UM THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RI E
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_570	THEY THERE ARE TWO LIGHNS IN THEME
Line_571	THERE ARE IS ON BULL THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULB
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OR PATHWAY THERE TWO PATH WAY
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR M CAFFWAY
Line_574	THEY RE THEIR ON POWER
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DAM
Line_576	I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOM BRIGHT A
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE BRY TO YOU THE FIST E
Line_578	UM THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY YOU HAVE
Line_579	THEY ARE ELECTRIC FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOWING
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSIT HAVE EN OUT THROUGH THE D
Line_582	THE IT JUST GOWING AND THROUGH THE POSIT S AND OUT THROUGH THE IS
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THE WITH THAT NO
Line_584	I DID NOT SHARE YOU SO PLEASE IT AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO WHOLL UP THE WEIGHS AND THEY ARE JU
Line_586	THEERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_587	IT LASTS THE H
Line_588	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BEURNING OUT QUICK BE
Line_590	UH THE TOP ONES ARE RIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM US
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE WA
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D CELL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND BOTH OF THEM
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEAD A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE Y SO WE NEAD THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SEARY IS A CIRCUIT
Line_596	AM GODED HOW ARE ARE YOU MY PULL LADY
Line_597	I FOUND OUT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND THE TRELLIX THINGS OBVIAUSLY BUS MORE AND A
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE REFREL WEIGH TALL
Line_600	BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETICK
Line_601	THE NAIL FAN IS STICKING ONTO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT AND S MADE OF I NOT
Line_603	WOOD YEAON PLASTICK YEAH
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS AND EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLO DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND STEEL ON IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT SO IT DOES NOT A CHA
Line_607	THEY BOLBE ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL YOU THINK THAT
Line_608	THEY ARE B MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_610	I TOLD YOU I MAGNET STICK TO IRONON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE PUT IS STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT MY HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I RIGHT TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FIN HA YOU
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND CORES
Line_623	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WELL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE UM IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY REPE
Line_628	THE SAME SIZE TIRE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPASS AND IT IS A NOITHE AND THE SOUTH SAME ON ERTH AND NOISE L AND A SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WEE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAD
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASE
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRENTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THE CON STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THEN YOU CAN NOT WILL DON'T LIKE J
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	I DON'T KNOW
Line_642	ELL IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS IN THE NAIL I MEAN IT IS AT THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BO STUFF MEANS THAT IT HAS
Line_646	I TO NOT NO
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	IVE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE E
Line_650	THE THERE ISAN'T ENUFF COW
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON B SIDE THEN THE END MA
Line_652	THERE ARE WASHER NO THEY'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO IN TO THE B CUP
Line_654	UM THAT YOU CAN PART THE SPACES
Line_655	IT S THE AMAGNET FORCE ME WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENDS THE FORICED
Line_657	I DO NOT OW
Line_658	I PUSH AND PUSH A
Line_659	YOU PUT SPACE THERE
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND A
Line_662	WELL IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IT FLOWS WEAKER
Line_663	GOOD
Line_664	WEAIVE AND SAN HOW IT WILL RRIVETS AND PICK UP WASHERS
Line_665	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WALL UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STES
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE WOODS SHOW FLOW HERE
Line_671	IT'S NOW AL
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MAN
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTRO MAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	THERE IS ALSS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	THATS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RAVIT
Line_676	OR ELECT TRICK ELECTRICITY AND THE STEEL RIVER MAKE A MAGNET AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_677	UM I CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THIN AND IT CAN PICKLE STUFF
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT DIS ROLES THE STEEL MRCUEIT
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BILAND TIME
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_687	THEY POPERCLUM
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRES WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM THE STEEL
Line_691	THAT HAD TO BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEAT OP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU'RE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CAN THAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK
Line_697	WITH OUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD NOT LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_698	IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM WHAT YOU MADE ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND AND OF THEM
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP AS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECT THE ELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WHEN IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVER REALLY STOPS IT JUST CEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE LU BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS ER BULBS REP THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO I THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	IT THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE NOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR A A ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	L ER THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTILL YOU DISTACHTO ONE F THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WON'T BE ABLE FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BASE CIRCLES SO DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND NO MATER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DON ANYTHING BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN A THE ENERGY FROM THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BAT
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW THE WAY
Line_714	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING THE SPAN AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES IT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WILL LEARN ABOUT YEST
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCH IT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE BO
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY CAN WORK THE SUNS ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY THAT YOU CAN U
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WERE IT WOULD NOT HERE AND THE DISTHE SUNS
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUD BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET UM AH
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREW
Line_727	ONE IS A SCREW IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PA PAPER CLIP IS COMPLEATING THIS CIRCUICUIT
Line_729	ECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRAH STICK IS MAKING DIFFERENT STEEL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRAPED STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT OBSORBES ALL V IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL AND IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR WELL METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS SO IT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT NECTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT'S STEEL NOT COMPLETE
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARALL PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	THE FAR BELL THE LIGHT BULBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT IT'S A SUM SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A CLCOMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	AS THE THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY GOING THE DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GETTING ITS ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOULD UM CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	IT COMES FROM THE ORAN ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE AND WEIGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING THE D CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT S I CAN BULB ON THE OTHER
Line_751	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEM SELVES THAT ART EV USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS THAT ARE TO HELP USE SOME OF THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL A VERYLEL AND PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING AH
Line_754	HUH GOOD
Line_755	THEY THEY'RE NARALLY USED A CRISMEC TO DECORATE M TREES AND HAPES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE HOLE STRING IS TURN OUT DIPENDING ON WHAT ITS
Line_758	A PARALL A PARALLEL CICIT
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF A BULB GOES OUT THE WHOLE LIGHT GOES THE WHOLE THING GOES ON HAVE TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB TURNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULBS WENT OUT IN THE MIDDL AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL BOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE ER BULBS SAY UH THAT ONES STEEL AND WHEN THAT TURNS OUT UNLESS ANOTHER IS TURNING
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEY'RE GOING AND IN AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST MS THEY W
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILL MA AND THE FILL IN THE BULB WITH THE FILLED BROKEN
Line_769	THE ELIMENT IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT'S FLOWING
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RING THE BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR COLEAR THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YEARON COPER AND SOME OTHER CINDS OF METAL
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL SCAR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK IS A EVEN
Line_777	STEEL IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE
Line_778	IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCK IS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULES IT TO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TEN AND THE OTHER ONE'S MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE IRON
Line_783	IT WILL STICK AS IT HAS TRACES OF L IRON
Line_784	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS TO GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK DON'T SIDE THAT YOU ME THE BLACK RC
Line_785	IT REALL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR A STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIP
Line_786	IS IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST REA FORCE
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WILL OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD STA ATTRACTING AND THEY WOULD REP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PLUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN COMPEL THE MAGNETS IT JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OPERCIS ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES REPEL
Line_791	GOING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE IS SIN COMPASS TO SEE WHICH HE IS GOING IT RIGHT NOW SHE IS GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE ERTH NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT SICK FOR MAGNETS AND WHAT HANDS WHEN THEY INTRACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECT
Line_797	MAGNETISM ONLY HAS A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BE ON THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TWO IT'S TWO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE MOTOR TAKES STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM THAT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	SO IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW AND IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY THEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONES
Line_802	IT'S IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL WHEN IT COMES OFF AND THE NAIL STOP BEING A MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DRAKE THE MAGNET PROFFIT STOP ING A MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING OFF THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_807	TAKE THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	TEA MAGNETISM TIRE
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SOL STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	ESY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP FRO THROUGH SUCH STICK STACK
Line_814	LEALING HOW STRONG THE FORCIF MAGNETISOM IS
Line_815	A BAGIT
Line_816	THERE IS ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISOM BRAKES BECAUSE IT'S TWO STRONG TO HAVE A WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY ADD A OTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THE MAGNETISM IS WEAKER CREEK TH THAT TO THE SPACERS
Line_819	IT MUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIGHT SO
Line_820	THE FOR FRIES SAW MAGNET TO D CELL UH
Line_821	I NOT IS UM
Line_822	MAKES IT WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY
Line_823	BULLIDS
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DCREASES IT
Line_826	YOU MAKES THE MAGNETIC PULL WEAKER
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT IT STOPS BEING ELECTRELECTRIFIDE AND THE MAGNETISM IT IT DISAPERES
Line_831	THERE'S A D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH IS RIVET AH THE WIRES AND THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT WORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE THE THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE METAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU WRAPPED AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGNETISM GET
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE POWERING A MOTOR IS ONLY IT HAS TO BE FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND IN CIRCLES SO IT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH ESALLY CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW UND IT CARENT BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIIDE AND MAGNEPIDE
Line_840	THE SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT MAGNETED UP TO THI THE RIVET
Line_842	AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISOM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AND STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THE IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	IT MEANS
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THERE CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIP THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINGING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SO SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_864	THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SMAL
Line_865	THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TWO MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	THE ENERGY WON'T THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VISE OCA
Line_875	I AM WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_877	IT IS THE CANDLE IS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASAN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING BECAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKE
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE A UM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM
Line_883	THE APPLES THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DILITSHIAS
Line_884	THERE WOULD BEE SMELCK OR STEEM
Line_885	IT GETS FOLGY OR SMOKY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP MY
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR IVE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT IT WOULD POLLUT THE AR
Line_889	I'M NOT SHURE BECAUSE YO HELP MY WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_894	I'M SARY UM THERE'S ONE D CELL AND TWO BULB
Line_895	IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TOGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	IT'S FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UMIGOS DO NOT GET THE CONCEPT
Line_900	H UM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK AND
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THEY IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE BASE END CASING THEN IT'S THERE OCAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AH
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND ONES THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRE
Line_905	THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING M THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY WEAR THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES ONE FOOT IT STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METTALLE
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE A POWEN
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THAT IT'S NORTH THE SOUTH OR SOUTH THE NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXCEPT FOR THE BOOM THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLD
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPRESS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS TICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHER
Line_930	IT IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY THIN THEN IT SHA GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY THICK THEN IT CANT
Line_932	UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	S UM THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THE
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP UM THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	IT TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS UM TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WELL THE NAIL IS ON THAT IT ONLY NO ALL THE MAGNETS ON IT
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFERING INTO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISOM IS TRANSFERING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT'S
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUFF ATTRACTION IT'S TWO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WHAT WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROK THE MAGNETIC
Line_947	THERE ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FOR SWEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SIX SPACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER LCUICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FOUR WEAKER AND THERE'S MORE SPACE THAN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT BEAKER
Line_952	YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MAKES THE FORCE WEAK ER THE FORCE AND BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU CAN FIND HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT H
Line_956	I SEE CANDLEI TICK
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SHERE REALLY WHAT'S HAPNING
Line_958	THAT IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	THE FIRE BURNING IS PROUF THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRIGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUT METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRINGH
Line_964	REFRIGERAT US THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON AN POSIABLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS STEEL NAIL WAS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THERE RE BOTH MADE AS STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WIGHT ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PRY HAW PR HAS LIKE METAL ON THE OUT SIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INS SIDE
Line_971	THE IRON IN IT OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNEY
Line_974	IVE BEEN LOWNING ABOUT HOW CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THERE'S A WASHERE A BATTERY LIGHT
Line_976	WAISHIERE BATTERY AND E
Line_977	THE WIRES THEY THEY BRAKE ALL ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FORM AND OTHER UM SO
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WASHER UM UM CARL
Line_980	IT PROVIDES HOW THE
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKE A
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_983	IT WILL SHUT OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL UM M
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CALL ELECTRICITY SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN LG
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITIES BATTERIES CAN THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECEIVE THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE ENERGY FROM THE
Line_988	IT'S FLOWRING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND T
Line_989	THE POINT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLIN OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS POS UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_991	IT SLIPED OVER IT SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU FLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BAT
Line_994	LET YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BUG
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULB LIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BIG BY UM THE D CELL
Line_997	THE ELECTRICITY IS BREAKING BO TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY US TO BREATHE THE BATTERY BRINGS THE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR FROM THE WALL
Line_999	CAN REPEATED I
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PATURE IS SO LIKE IT BUNT IT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTOR STUTS UM SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLO OPEN
Line_1003	I NOTICE THAT UM THE UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM IT SPINS AND UM
Line_1004	IT CAN YOU REPEAT
Line_1005	UH IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE MOTOR GET BUT WHEN I CLOSED IT IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T MAN IT DOESN'T MAKE ELECTRICITY UM FLOW UP TO THE MOTOR MY R
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GGON OUT SIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLAR POWNDOR IS CONLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WAIRS TO THE MOTOR SO HAT THE MOTOR CAN
Line_1009	ONE BRING ELECTRICITY INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIC
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPANS TE
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO COMPLETE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE METAL UM
Line_1013	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1014	
Line_1015	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARTS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	WE'RE KIND FIVE MORNY O IT JUTS THAT YOU HAN A
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	I DON'T YOU ASC ME ABOUT HOW I'M FIELING
Line_1020	UM YOUR JUST MEAN I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES D CELL AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD YOU'LL GO
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW UM LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND UM PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND OERELEC TROIS AND IT HAS L
Line_1026	I SEE OF THE MIDDLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELTING CLUMTHE FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	MI ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DON'T HOW LIKE ANYTHING YOU JUST WHAT
Line_1029	I CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS PUTTING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAHYE
Line_1030	YOU MAY PI DOWN AGIN
Line_1031	WHE UM ACTUALLY DOING PERTY GOOD
Line_1032	UH WE'VE BEEN DOING UM POWER
Line_1033	IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOTS ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UH CAN YOU BE PICKED OUT AGAIN
Line_1036	CAN YOU PICK UP LIES
Line_1037	THERE HAS TREE UM UM
Line_1038	THE PULBS ARE GETTING DAMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU HAVE MORE D CELLS THEN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AS THE TIME YOU ADD MORE D CELL
Line_1040	UM ONE BATTERY ONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHERAND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU HAVE A POAGE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECT TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE I HAVE A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUITS
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NO
Line_1047	IT
Line_1048	IT'S A IT'S JUST THE USCE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY UM WON'T WILL DON
Line_1050	THEY SCIRVE YOU LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO LIGHT
Line_1051	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINES SINE
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWS IN THE UM PLUSS SHINE AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINE I
Line_1055	MOLECULES OR ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE METTAL BULBS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKAY HAS UN FINE
Line_1057	THE MINRES SINE
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MARNEY
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T STAR IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	ETHER WAY YOU CLICK ONE WIR OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TO
Line_1062	I WAS BILDING A CIRCUIT STEEL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND INTO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND IT IT IS ON AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NO RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT MEXED TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S A BULB IT'S THE METAL AND IT IT'S LIKE ELECTRIC FING TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	IT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I I CLICKED IT IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE IS THE FLAG STOP SHLOWING IT'S AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEXIGOMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE WHAT CLOSE NAME
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BAL AND THEY AND THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WON'T SERVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S ON
Line_1080	IT TS IT'S OFF IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY AND THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND THEN TO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOFTHING IS HAPPENING
Line_1084	YOU TWO MARNEY ST YOU LATER HAVE A GOOD DIE TWO BYE
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
Line_1087	ELECTRIC UM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I SAW THAT IT WOULD WORK
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM HAVE BEEN REALLY BEEN DOING ALU JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT WON'T IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTICK IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD E THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THEIR CONDUCTORS ARE Y THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTORS STARTED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND A SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE L ENERGY IT'S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE WE AND TO PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE THE STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE THE PLASTICK AND IT'S SON
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALK SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTON
Line_1111	BAPPLES
Line_1112	THE FUEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE ARE BEING EK AND E
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE AIR HOT AND SMOK COMES WAS BIGGER
Line_1115	THE SOLARD PANEL
Line_1116	GASS BOING WINDMILS SOLID ADNELES
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BOTH STIR ENERGY
Line_1118	THEY BOTH HAVE ENERGY IN UM AND BOTH TIRE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BOTH ARE CUL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SCERVE ENERGY THEY JUST GIVE ABOUT SMOLK AND THE GASS MAKES THE CAR
Line_1121	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLID PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GASS DOESNRT
Line_1123	THEY SEARVED THAT SMILKANMALBIE AND THREE
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE FLAT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IS LIGHTING UPT
Line_1127	THEY ARE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILLIMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW EANYWEIRE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT'LL WORK LIKE A SWITCH ON THE CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	UH IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET MECER
Line_1134	THEY BULL THEY ONE GETS BRIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FASING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN I CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLIPED IT AGAIN THEY STOPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF STUFF AND MAGNETS
Line_1140	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONSEARNING EMERGY
Line_1143	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE IT IS ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FIL MAN
Line_1145	UM I WEALL KNOW
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING UM GO THROUGH THE BATTERY AS UM MEN THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON SIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FOR WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT UH AN INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRE
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DED
Line_1160	STRINGS LIGHTS RE I DON'T REAL IN THEM
Line_1161	IT'S TRY NO LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE B THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DINE
Line_1163	WIRES AND A BATTERY AND
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEVEL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DING
Line_1166	THE FILLIMENT DIDE
Line_1167	THE FILLMENT DIDE ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILMAN DIES AND THE RIGHT AND THE WIGHT
Line_1169	A FILM IS DING ON THE BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CONDESSENT CIRCUITS AND I CAN REMEMBER THE REST
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NO THE BATTERY THE FILLMENT ISN'T DOING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPENS IS THE FILM BREAKS AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GRAY AND IT STOPS M
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINES SIGNE AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AN AN COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	H THE FILLIMAT IS DING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT'S T
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CONDESS AND CIRCUITS A MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW YOU
Line_1180	I'VE BEEN WELL DON'T NOT LAFF MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH SO THERE GO HAVE TO BE US IT SO THAT I CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE TRACTING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	BECAUSE IT'S STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	WORM THE MAGNETS STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THEN NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WOOD IS BECAUSE IT'S
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPER NAIL AM P DOES
Line_1187	BECAUSE BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD DOES NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL THE IT WILL FIT IS AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS LETS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TOMES
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	TIMSTIN
Line_1198	THESE RE MAGNET THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNET THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY ON THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT DOES STOPS AND IT DOES FALL AND IT DOES F
Line_1205	NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BILLD UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED TO HAVE ALL THE SOPLIZE I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETSTHREE WIRES AND A BATT
Line_1209	IT GOES FUEL E
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIE
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVETS STOPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPS AND THE MAGNETS S
Line_1212	UM MATOLTIRENT
Line_1213	OPEN MEAN CLOSED
Line_1214	THE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNETS BY THE RIVET
Line_1215	ELECTRICITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	RAN MIRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BO MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB BUL
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS THE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE A TURNEL
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOKED TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GOING THROUG
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1226	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE WHAT'S EATS THE POWER COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THIS D CELL TOWARDS THE NE THE POSIT THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS EN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF HE
Line_1231	I WAS ABSENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PARALLS AND HOW A SOLAR PANEL ON AND DING FRIEND HE AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR AND MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICE THAT ALL THE PIECLS ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	ININSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THESE THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTICK AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS ON ER INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS CONDUCTOR
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOES IT WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRIC
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND EL AND ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYSE FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORK AND WITH OUT ENERGY IT NOTHING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS HAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS
Line_1242	YEAH YOU HERE LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLAND TYPE OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BEARNING
Line_1245	WHEN WHEN THE HANDS POUWED ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EACH HIS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOOD SO SHE CAN CEEP ON WASH
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEARE NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRLS EATING AND JUST GIVING HER ENERGY SHE CAN CKEEP ON WAKE
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTS THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PUTS THE AIR THE AIR GETS ALL DIRTY AND NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO BREATH IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKY
Line_1252	THEY ARE SMLAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STOR IT
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COR SORE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BEURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND GLASS WILL POLLUTE THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BEURN THE
Line_1255	COAL AND GASS WOULD HAVE A BADD EFFECT ON THE VIRONMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BRA
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES ARE THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	THE ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FOR THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVEMENT ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE WIRE
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1262	THE DOTS MOVING REPRES THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT ITS CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE ARE IS ONE PATH THE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIES IT
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH
Line_1265	BYE MORE
Line_1266	FARY WELL H
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE IS TWISCE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOW GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAY
Line_1274	THE END IN THE BATTERY WIRE ELECTRICITY LEEIDES IT JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE C OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB AND GOES INTO THE POSITIV
Line_1276	I NOTICE THAT THE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB INSO A THE OTHER ONE
Line_1277	I US HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BUB WIRES AND WIRES AND ALL AND A BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY RIGHT THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOARCE IS THE SAME THING
Line_1281	WELL IT'S A SAME THING
Line_1282	ATE
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHIGHT DECES
Line_1284	WELL THEY LINED UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THERE IS W THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT UP AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE IT DO
Line_1286	CAN D SEE THEN AGAIN
Line_1287	UM IT IS GOING TO LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING LIKE THE SAME
Line_1289	THEY ARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENTLY
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST WE AND THEN IT TURNES ST YELLOW SWITURNE
Line_1291	I LOOK AT NICE STU
Line_1292	WE HAS NON DOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GO
Line_1293	WELL THE UHM GREY CHEEK IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATT
Line_1294	IT IS BULB BECAUSE MOTOR THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLIGHT MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE AROUND AND
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DO THAT
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE IT ENERGY FROM THE BATTE
Line_1300	THE THE FLAG MO
Line_1301	THE FLA AIRS MOVING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN ST THE FLAG WILL STOP
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH HIT'S WIRE UM THE FLAG STARES
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG STAR
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DO IT YET
Line_1306	THE GREY PIECE WHEN IT'S SUN
Line_1307	WELL ON A CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU CLIP THE S
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVIN
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS LOCKING THE FLAG STUPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UM
Line_1312	I SEE THE FLAG MEAN
Line_1313	THE THE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTER
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRE SO LESS MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THEA UM WIRES AND THE SWITC
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSED
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE THE STICK
Line_1319	IT IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	OH I DON'T ONLY KNOW BECAUSE I AM WON'T LEARNING T
Line_1321	O CASE SO THE PWASSTICK
Line_1322	THE STEEL MET THE STEEL THE
Line_1323	YOU'RE TO BYE MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A CIRCUIT
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE AND THE FLAG IS ALEUING BY THE R
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND ROUND AN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH AND THE WIRE
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1329	IT STAPS IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UM
Line_1331	YEAH MANE
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANL AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STAY IT'S GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MILK THE CAN
Line_1334	BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WOULD TO BE ABLED THREE
Line_1335	IT MELTS BECAUSE OF FIRE IT CAN IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IT'S LIKE MOVING SO THAT UM WE CAN SO THAT IT'S IRE
Line_1337	NOB I COULD NOT S THINK
Line_1338	IT WAS A SALAD I DON'T WAIT I IT WAS FIRE
Line_1339	IT IS CICULAR ENERGY OFFHONUH BE YEAH I
Line_1340	IT MAKES DOWN SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GASSBUTDLE APPLES AND A FIRE
Line_1343	MEAL WIRES APPLE WOOD BULAX STUFF AND A G
Line_1344	IT GOES ON AND ON
Line_1345	THE SOLAR PARALLEREY ANE
Line_1346	EST
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT IS
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN LEARING MATE
Line_1349	UH THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STRAIGHT ONE IS CURVED AND THE ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	IT IS UH CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IT
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIGOER REFRIGERATOR
Line_1352	WELL IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE UH MIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNIC AND SO THE REFRIGERATOR IS BAD
Line_1354	WELL THE THE THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE RE
Line_1355	THEY I BECAUSE THAT THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MAGN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE THE SCREEN
Line_1357	WELL ATTRACTRITY DOAUS BUT IT DOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1359	DOL
Line_1360	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ARINER
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1364	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON T
Line_1365	I
Line_1366	IT'S WILL
Line_1367	ENTERGY HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BAG
Line_1369	THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO A LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WAIST THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THE WIRES JUST GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO IT'S NORML SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSH
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SOPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SOPOSED TO BE EACH END
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MATING IT'S LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED OF
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN NOT PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IS STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AND NEEDS METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR A TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ATRICITY FOR A PIECE OF AND TE
Line_1381	ON ONE SIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
Line_1382	INSULATORS RE ARE HELPFL
Line_1383	IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ER
Line_1384	SO
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN BE PULCKED ON
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT IT'S MELTEN
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS A NOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND TROPT I HER THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
Line_1390	IT'S HEATING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING UM
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUT YOU'RE ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOKISS UM THE SOUND AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HER FEET
Line_1393	UM SHE IS GETTING N THE ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS
Line_1394	THE APPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PAN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE GASSISAN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	FRBECAUSE THE COAL HAS BEEN BEARNED AND THE GASS HAS AND I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MELT THE ERTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE THES IN EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	IT WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT RENEWABLE
Line_1400	IT IS A COMPLETE THE FORM MA FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
Line_1401	WEELL UM I THINK THAT THEY LIKE THE DOT OR THE ENERGY AND THAT'S WHAT IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB WIGHTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE B THERE IS FOR PATHWAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO U D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK GO WEAR MAYBE
Line_1405	E IF THE THREE UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS A NOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLAS OF THE WIRES AND THEY AREN'T POS TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS STWORD AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE NOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES IS A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR A S WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UHM I KNOW
Line_1413	THAT WHAT THE LIGHT BULBS BROK
Line_1414	L THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE I SEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1416	B IS SWITCHE FOR A NO ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT THE BATTERY
Line_1418	GOD BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHEN YOU WARE TOLPY AND M I
Line_1419	BULB STORED TO WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	FOR I TRICK LIGHT ISE PARTY
Line_1421	THE WIRES HOLDS LIKE ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1422	WELL IT WILN'T WORK ET MORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE THE ENERGY IS HOLD BATH
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANG OR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALL READY TRIED OUT AND STU
Line_1424	I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SO THE WAR
Line_1426	OH BARE Y AND CAN LIKE PLEASE IS FIT
Line_1427	I BULB ROLE AND THE
Line_1428	IT BILLE BRROK SO I DO THE WORK SO IT IN T HAS TO CHANE TE FOR I
Line_1429	WE SEED A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A ALL
Line_1430	THE WORK GETTING MORE BECAUSE IT'S THAT IT'S T
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THE ELECTRICITY'S GOING TO ALL THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UH N IT DON'T WORKS ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER E
Line_1433	FROLKIT AND IT DOESN'T LIGHT WORK
Line_1434	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERY'S
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A CUPLE OF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE SHRYING BE
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO WEAR WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SOM POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY DULL THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP THE POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING
Line_1440	UM POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASH LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEVES POWER AND FROM THE UM WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND EM
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYSE GOES FROM TOP TO B
Line_1445	UM WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN AND DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHIY IT'S I DIDN'T ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN SEE THE PIXTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MO
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING US POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1453	A SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	THE THE PERSON WHO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER SOR POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN FOR
Line_1460	TALE HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DIS CONNECTED
Line_1461	WHENTEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO IT WON'T
Line_1462	ITCH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHTWAY
Line_1463	WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY EARN ABOUT THE MA BECAUSE THE PA THE WE GOT THE LIGHTED BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG I
Line_1466	WE'RE TRYING TO MIXTURE IT'S WITH DIFFERENT E
Line_1467	SWITCH OND ME ALUMINUM NAIL
Line_1468	UH YOU SEE OF ANIUM THE DOLL SWITCH TIL LONGER
Line_1469	SWITCH THE METAL E
Line_1470	TH IT'S TOUCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METAL OF IT MA HE
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	IT'S NOT THEN ERLLY ELS TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST WAL
Line_1473	IT'S MAKING IT WORK NO
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS A LIGHT BETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF
Line_1477	THE FLAM GLARS OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND PAT THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_1478	IT BURNS IN THE WAX IT MELTS
Line_1479	UH IT SOUNDED IT'S COMING LIKE POPPING A LITTLE T BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOME OTTER S HITTING THE BOMGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVING MANERS
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EVING CARRYIING ANDTHAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DISC FAND THREE BRANCHES RAISENS AND STEELE
Line_1483	IT GIVES MORE AIR BECAUSE OF THE THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE C THE FIRE CAN POLLUTE AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT FLICS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S NON AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HIDE
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A FAMINAMOTE
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT OUR SELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	UM THE FRUNT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINES
Line_1494	CLOSER THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND THE
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FILL THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF IT GETS STUCK WORK
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHT AR
Line_1497	IT 'LL GET REALLY LIGHT AND WAY
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAY BE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNS BATTERIES REALLY QUIP
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHER
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWISCE ON BOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRAG
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERY SERIES CIRCUITS HAD MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE M IT'S NOT A COMPLETE SHUR
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT WHATCHS THE BULB I THINK IT HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE SUN
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILM BRAKES IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND YE
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTCH OF THE CIRCUIT BREAK
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS STOPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE'S SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE UM BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON A DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STAY
Line_1513	THERE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1514	THATHING HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO E
Line_1515	BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHEN ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT AMALTIPLE CIRCUITS SOR IT CAN FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
Line_1516	TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO POWER UP
Line_1517	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL GOING UH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER OFF AND PASS THROUGH THE REAR END OF THE D
Line_1518	FOR ENERGY'S GO DIRECTLY TO LIGHT BULB AND MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1519	THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE IT THROUGH THE BATTERY BACK TO THE NEGATIVE SD
Line_1520	THAT THERE'LL BE MALTIMALY PATHWAYS IN THE SERIES AND INSTEAD OF A
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER UP BOTH OF THE LIGHT
Line_1522	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE UH LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BEE THAT THAT D
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT
Line_1528	THAT THE D CELLS DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY
Line_1529	BYE
Line_1530	THEY'RE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH END EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT SHAKE LIKE A DON'T
Line_1531	WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH GO ON TO EACH OTHER THEY CONNECT BUT IF NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH TRY TO CONNECT IT WON'T WORK
Line_1532	UM IT'S ALL ONE BIG SIDE
Line_1533	THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THEY'RE ALL ON THEIR END
Line_1534	THE STEEL STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DOT BRING MAGNE
Line_1535	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MAGNETIC
Line_1536	WOOD YERON AND CARPET
Line_1537	THE ONES THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET YOU STICK TO IT THE ONES THAT DON'T IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT STICK TO TO IT IT WILL JUS
Line_1538	THE WIGHT NAIL ISN'T A MAGNETIC THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT'S NOT STICKING TO IT
Line_1539	THE ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A MAGNET THAT ISN'T A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT WILL STICK TO A MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
Line_1540	IT HAS TO BE ETHER METAL OR IRON
Line_1541	MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED AND STEEL
Line_1542	I THINK THEY HAS SOME KIND OF OR IN IT
Line_1543	FOR AND IRON
Line_1544	THAT THERE IS ONLY
Line_1545	THAT THEY ARE BOTH WRIGHTING
Line_1546	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE ONES ON THE ONE ON THE
Line_1547	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT MORE OR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO I DON'T
Line_1548	THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE IT WOOD LIGHT
Line_1549	THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS TO POWERS THEM UP AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D
Line_1550	THAT THEY ARE POWERING UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1551	THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_1552	TO
Line_1553	THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS THE KEEPS BEURNING OUT
Line_1554	THAT THERE ARE UH MORE THAN ONE D CELL
Line_1555	THAT THEY ARE MORE RIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_1556	THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THERE IS JUST
Line_1557	THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT LIGHTING AND
Line_1558	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE CIRCUIT
Line_1559	THAT SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
Line_1560	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONE
Line_1561	THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1562	THAT THE BULBS ARE BEURNING OH
Line_1563	THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE WATERS SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1564	THAT THE FILM IS BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT
Line_1565	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1566	BUT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1567	THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINYOW
Line_1568	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1569	THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH THEY NO ONE THEY DON'T WILL ER QUICKLY
Line_1570	THAT WHEN THE ONE FILM BREAKES THE THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBWIL STILL C CONTINYOW
Line_1571	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY UH
Line_1572	THAT THE FILM BRAKES AND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
Line_1573	IT'S IT WAKES IT IT'S LIKE SO LIGHT BALL
Line_1574	A THE UM FILLOW AND BREAK
Line_1575	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
Line_1576	ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
Line_1577	THAT THEY ARE A MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH CON SELLS
Line_1578	THE THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE WOLD BREAK THEM APART
Line_1579	THAT THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FOR SPRINGS THEM TOGETHER
Line_1580	THAT THE MAG THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIVE
Line_1581	BECAUSE IT IS METAL AND IT'S STICKING TO THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF A MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THAN NAY
Line_1582	THAT IT IS METAL
Line_1583	WOOD GRASS DEREK
Line_1584	THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NAIL WOOD STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1585	I DON'T
Line_1586	BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT UH METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT THE MAGNETS STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER R OTHERS WILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE IS STEEL R ONE STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I DID
Line_1591	THAT IT STICKED
Line_1592	STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1593	THAT IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER IT CAN NOT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1594	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1595	STEEL OR METAL OR I
Line_1596	THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT IT COULD STICK AND NOT STICK ON TO THEM AND THE NORTH POLE SOUTH POLE
Line_1597	CAN YOU REPETE THAT
Line_1598	THEY HAVE THER METAL IN THEM WHITCH UH MAGNET CAN ATTRACT TO
Line_1599	THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL ONE
Line_1600	THAT THE MAGNET AND CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1601	THAT'S THE MAGNET MAGNET MAGNET I DON'T KNOW
Line_1602	THAT ONE SACK IS BIGGER THAN OTHER SO THE MAGNET CAN WHAT NO WAS ABOUT THEM
Line_1603	MICARL
Line_1604	THAT THE MAGNET CAN NOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNETS TO THAT STICK PAPER
Line_1605	THAT THE MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE UM MAGNET
Line_1606	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE IT IT WILL IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THEN TELL THE MAGNET GETS TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIVE FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET RAY
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS IN
Line_1611	WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	THAT WHEN IT GETS NINTEEN WASHERS AND BAGNETISOM BREAKE
Line_1613	THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	THE SPACERS WERE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY TIRMES I NEED TO SA HA
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER
Line_1619	IT TOOK NIN SPACERS SO RING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO RAPID AROUND THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1622	THAT'S THE WIRES RAT WRAPPED ABOUND THE RIVET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE LIKE WOOL STICK TO THE RIB
Line_1623	SO IT PRODUCES THE ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRYS EL MAGNETISM FORCE SO IT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METAL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET CAN CARRYED METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THAT THE ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IT IS NOT AN ELECTRO MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IF THIS ELECTRO MAGNET IT COULD IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS CLOSED
Line_1631	IT SORTS TO PICK UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1633	THE RU SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	THE BE WRAPPED ABOUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BLB
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT ALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELL UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TOOL TO USE
Line_1639	UM I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE UM IT'S A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1640	UM I THINK WHAT TRAVELS AND WIRES AS ENERGY TOOK HER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROME ORE ANY THING THAT NEEDS LIGHT AND DARK NESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINEST SCINE BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN
Line_1645	IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SINE AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE P
Line_1646	I THINK THE PLODOS REPERT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINES SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONE COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHAT IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BYE MARNEY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE A GREAT HEL
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES
Line_1652	ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO THE CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	UM IS GIVING THE CELL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAGS
Line_1660	I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WAIST ENERGY ANDWELL IT DOESN'T WAIST
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPINING IN THIS CIRCUT
Line_1664	THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS TO THE WIRES INTO THE TO MAKE THE FLAG
Line_1665	YOU TWO MARNEY THANK BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN AROUND AND
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE DIFFERENT STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND AN
Line_1670	I H'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN NO
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE MOTORS SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPAN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL NOT WORK
Line_1674	AN SI ING TOPEON MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DISCRIVE IT AS CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1677	CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE ANYTHING METAL ACORN CAN CREATE OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
Line_1679	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASST RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNEY I HAD A REALLY GRATE TON
Line_1681	GOOD GOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW YOU W
Line_1683	UM HOW DO W WELL I FORGOT BECAUSE I IT
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT
Line_1685	I FORGOT IT SO
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY AND THEN LIKE IT LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND MAY BE INTO EVERYTHING
Line_1688	IT'S FOLLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WEAK
Line_1689	DIBLUE LOTS OR D UH ELECTRICITY
Line_1690	THEY CONNECT OMY BUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THE LITER REINS MY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	THE BHEFRION IS THAT IT GOES TO D CELL IT GOES A MAGNET LIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE WAR
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THAT METAL IN THE AND
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THRRY FOR FIVE SIX AND A NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULDN'T BE MORE ENERGY AND THEN LIGHT BULB L LIGHE
Line_1695	UM MORE BULBS UM MEANS LESS THE LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILLN'T GET BOTH ARE AND DOESN'T NOT VERY GO
Line_1697	I THINK THAT LIGHT BULBS WOULD LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WITH ONE D CELL IS NOT VARY RED BUT THE ONE WITH DO THIS IS Y Y
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT ATTAL
Line_1700	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GET
Line_1702	WITH LS I I WOULD MIXED
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT IT S NOT ACTUALLY U NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WIRES AND WIRELS MATING SPRAY LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	I HERE DRIMING DON'T NO
Line_1707	I THINK THAT THE BOUT I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB BULB DEM
Line_1708	I NO ABLE TWENYBERDS AND S ROLLING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE FORE PATHWAYS MAY
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK UM IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	I REMEMBER THAT IT GOES OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1713	UM I THINK IT IS SWALLING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_1714	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHWAY
Line_1716	UM I DON'T KNOW OW ALLY
Line_1717	I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PIXTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER MIXTURE HAS A WIRE
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE I WELL I DON'T KNO
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'R DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	I CIRCE THE THE TOP OR OR
Line_1721	IT THINKS THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT THIS ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S THEIR BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I AM MARNING H
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT UM THE SWITCH IS NOT OMINORVIERAYSO IT'S NOT MIGHTY
Line_1726	BECAUSE OF THE TWITCH IS NOT PROECTED THEM
Line_1727	UM I THINK THAT ON THE BUB WOULD NOT LIGHT TO YOU
Line_1728	I DON'T UM WE
Line_1729	UM THA LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT T AND T
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THE THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER IS NOT LIGHTING OFF CLO
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULB MAYBE
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILLIMAND BRAKES THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT THIS BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILM IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS LIGHTING BECAUSE OF THE ONE IS BROKN
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT BECAUSE OF THE FIULMARILLP SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGH
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLEATLY STOP
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT HAPMS WHEN THE BULB BREAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T PULL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	UM A PARALLEL MANE
Line_1738	WHENEVER ONE BREAKES THE OTHER IT'S LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HASE IT'S ON WIRES
Line_1739	I NOTICED THAT WHENEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILM BRAKES BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON THE BULB UM THE ENERGY COMPOLE LE STOPS
Line_1741	I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BRAKES THE OTHER ONES STEEL W
Line_1742	THE MIXTURE HAS TO DO WITH THE BULB BURNING OUT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES FACED
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE ARE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TO THE LIGHT BULB B
Line_1744	I THINK THEM BULB IS LID UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS
Line_1745	WHEN EVER ONE BULB BERNS THE OTHER ONE BREAKS OUT
Line_1746	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER A ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM D US A LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BUL ONE FILLIMET IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	VE WHENEVER THE FILLIMIT BREAKES THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STUP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILLMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	UM I THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN WIRES
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDER BULBS UM WHENEVER ONE FILM BREAKES THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS
Line_1756	ELECTRICITY STOPS THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT REALATS TO THE LAST ONE I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILLIMET IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
Line_1760	I THINK THEY LOOK THAT ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILMIT BREAKS AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	I KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UM I NOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB IS LIT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	I THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	B WHATEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANY THING WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRIDGE IS ETHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IT MORDERS FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET AND IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY RIVER MADE OUT OF UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	IT THEY HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TYPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS ER FOUL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE EITHER MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE ITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERIES WIRES AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MEADE THE WOOD
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILLS LIGHT UP THE
Line_1787	THAT IS USE TO LIGH
Line_1788	IT IT'S LIGHTING UP THE
Line_1789	YOOREH
Line_1790	IT FLOES BY IT HAS LESS OF ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE BULB TO MAKE IT ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN IN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO HERE
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWMING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE FL
Line_1794	IT'S MOVING TO THE MINEST SWITH
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINES
Line_1797	IT'S GIVING LESS OF ENERGY
Line_1798	UM TOE
Line_1799	IT DOESN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	IT GIVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING POWER
Line_1802	ITS
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN IT TURN ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER SO
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SISTOM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOP
Line_1808	IT'S GOING AROUND THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR ME
Line_1809	LEARNING H
Line_1810	THE MOTOR S MOVING
Line_1811	AN STINING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER IT INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT SINK
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SONG ON IT IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1814	D CELL WIRESMOTOR
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY AND A
Line_1816	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T STIN
Line_1817	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T GIVE ENERGY
Line_1818	THE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1819	THE SPOUNGE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1820	THEY ARE DIFFERENT CAUS SOME ARE METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S A METAL IT'S CELL THAT
Line_1822	IT FLVED THAT WHEN YOU PUT METAL ONTO IT WHEN IT WAS
Line_1823	IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1824	IT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WON'T MITE
Line_1825	THE NOT THE SPIN COULD IT'S METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE CALLED THEY ARE MAKING THE UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I CAN'T NOW
Line_1827	I HA
Line_1828	TO RIGHT CANDAL FROM
Line_1829	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU
Line_1830	IT'S A CANDLE AND IT WE LASED SCIENCE BECAUSE
Line_1831	IT'S MILSTING
Line_1832	BECAUSE IT TO GIVE IT AND
Line_1833	PUT
Line_1834	THE LIGHT
Line_1835	THE JEEMS
Line_1836	CHE IS EVEN CAP
Line_1837	IT'S GIVING COUNTERS
Line_1838	IT'S DOING ENERGY
Line_1839	THE GIRL IS GET HER ENERGY AND YOUR BODY
Line_1840	I MEAN
Line_1841	HER ER BODIES
Line_1842	YOU SEE A CANDLE SOM
Line_1843	ND APPLES
Line_1844	IT WILL ESPERECUED
Line_1845	IT IT'S IT GIVES HEAT
Line_1846	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1847	DON'T ER
Line_1848	THEY'RE ONE CHULE
Line_1849	TYOU LI
Line_1850	BECAUSE GUESS WILL GIVE THE COAL ENERGY
Line_1851	BECAUSE YES ONE HAS NOT A TRAIN ONE DOESN'T
Line_1852	I CAN NOT KNOW
Line_1853	E DO NOT KNOW
Line_1854	ME HAD MERKEN
Line_1855	A NET HOW IT'S APSANT
Line_1856	LEARNING HOW TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND MAGNET
Line_1857	TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELL GIVE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT UP THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING A PATHWAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BATH INTO THE D CELL
Line_1862	CO DOCTS
Line_1863	IT'S BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TH THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1865	THE ENERGY
Line_1866	MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERG
Line_1867	WHEN WHEN YOU ADD ENOUGH OR D CELL IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
Line_1868	A A D CELL TO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT LIGHTER SO IT GETS B SO MORE
Line_1869	ONE THESE ONE LIGHT BULBS HAS A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY OF T GOE A WILL PASS THROUGH
Line_1872	AND THE D CELLS ARE TO STU TOGETHER
Line_1873	GOOD
Line_1874	MAGNEATISOMS
Line_1875	WHEN SAT AND NOISE GO TOGETHER IT WILL
Line_1876	IT'S REPELLING
Line_1877	IT' BECAUSE THEY ADD THE SAME
Line_1878	BECAUSE STAND THEY'RE THEY'RE DIFFERENT
Line_1879	MAGNET MAGNETISOM
Line_1880	THEY
Line_1881	WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN MAN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING AND E
Line_1882	IT'S IT'S GOIN
Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN IT YOU TURN IT ON IT RILL TURN ON THE LIGHT WON'T
Line_1884	THEN YOU MA HAVE TO SPILL IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT RONG
Line_1885	IT WELL WEIGHT UP
Line_1886	IT THAT IT WILL BEURN OUT BECAUSE IT BROKEN
Line_1887	IT'S FILL IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT SPROK IT WILL CIRCLE ONE
Line_1889	IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ON TWO LONG PROPERLY
Line_1890	ONE LIGHTS RAN OFF R AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT
Line_1891	IT'S ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WEILL STOP THEN
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY FOURCE
Line_1894	IT'S WHEN IT IS RAN OUT
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT LIGHT CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL STA
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WILL STUFF ON MET
Line_1899	BECAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NOTHING CHAPONING
Line_1901	IT'S COST
Line_1902	CAUSE IT THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS AROUND OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND RE
Line_1904	WHEN YOU D NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT WHEN SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON ONE SIDE AND THAT OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	IS WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I NO
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRA
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MAG
Line_1909	IT' BECAUSE IT HAS IRON INSIDE OF IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACTS TO HAS IRON IN SIDE OF IT YOU DOESN'T HAVE IRON OUT OF
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPETE THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIND HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
Line_1913	TER HAS IRON AND THE MAGNET US IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS
Line_1915	MAGNET STICK TO IRON
Line_1916	BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE IS IT
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON AND NE
Line_1919	THE EL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NO METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACT IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DAN
Line_1927	THAT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE BEEN CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_1929	THEN D CELL IS IT A CIRCUIT IT'S THE MIX
Line_1930	BECAUSE WHEN WON'T GO THE WIRES IT'S SLOLVIES OUT AND OTHER ELECTRICITY AS LIKE THE MAKE THE
Line_1931	THAT ELECTROCITY S DON'T GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	A SAL HAS TO BE APTULLTDENWIRES TO GO RE TO BOTH MA LIKE TRICITY TO ED
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GO BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT DROPS RE CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLATTER A
Line_1935	METAL AND H REAL TO THE E OF SO I MAKE THAT YOU'LL I TO GET FLY E
Line_1936	IT'S NOT C TOUCHING METAL SO WHEN ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WON'T MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WILN'T GO THROUGH A D CELL AND IT WILN'T TO THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH TRIPY UH
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE IS SHAING THIS THE THAT IT IT MORE BUT WHEN IT COMES THEN IT WILL WORK AND THE FLAG BO
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT ER
Line_1942	IT WOULDN'T COULD THE HAS TO CEMTY AND IT HAVE TO MAKE IT ER
Line_1943	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE TRACT AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOES
Line_1945	PRODCIL ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MEAREBING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT AND IT IS A HEAVY ELECTRICITY WHICH WE CAN NOT VE
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL THE WA TO THE MOTOR AND LIKING THE FLAG R
Line_1949	IS HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING A FLAG HUH
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HUKED UP TO THE SWITCH
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WILN'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	LET THE SWITCH A B OFF
Line_1953	IT DOSN'T A
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR STUCKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL ARE THE WEIGHT TO THE STEEL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN GOES AT HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1956	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNY
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BENT UP THE CLOUDY DAY IT IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1958	IT DOUS IT WA
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	IT MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATE ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING THE CICUITS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG UM
Line_1963	ELECTRICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECT TO TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR Y TO LIGHT
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	IT HAVE TO MAKE A PASS WHEN YOU CONNECTED IT
Line_1969	IT LIKE HE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT UM IT GOES BACK
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTOR TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE POSIT
Line_1974	NO IT'S GOING THE S WEIGH BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TREND ON IT WOULD BE GOING THE POSIT A
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWASE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH A LITTLE LIGHT BULB
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE THE TWO BACES OF THE BULB I DONT WANT O WORKECASE THE WIRES S TO CAL UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOULD WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FIND WE'VE MET THE FOR
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOUVE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AN ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT A PAY
Line_1981	YOU SHU PUT A NAIL IN THEIRE IT'S IT'S LIKE WEIGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFOR
Line_1983	YE GOOD HOW ARE YOU I NOW YOU'RE MET BEFOR B THE I DON'T WANT MAKE YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
Line_1985	SHING THE SH UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO YEAH NO
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO S METAL SO HAS TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_1988	METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING S METAL THEN IT IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL AND THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE STHINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILLD NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO LO
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL AND THE LITTLE MY THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIPE RIER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART BUM
Line_1997	UM SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIX
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS IND YOUR FOOD
Line_1999	ALL OF THE THE DIFFERENT FOD MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BULBE BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP ON THE FUEL
Line_2001	THE WATER IS FILTERING
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STADE IN THE COPY FILTER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILTERIN
Line_2004	SO THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALVETD WE CALLED THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE NOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU MIX SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHAT YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIF JUST DIDE AGAIN
Line_2010	SOIL PROACTS
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DIPENDING ON THE AREA
Line_2013	THEY SAD THAT TH THERE WERE THERE IS THE ES THINGS IN SWATHERE IS THOSE THINGS IN SWA
Line_2014	THERE IS HOME GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN IT
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	UM GRAVLE CLAY AND SILK
Line_2017	HOMES SCRALE CLAY AND SILK
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DEL MOUNTS AND AND FARM LANS HAVE MOR ORGANIC CARBON
Line_2019	DEL HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MITDTAL
Line_2020	THERE IS A LOT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL AND THAT THING BECAUSE IT HAS ILCLAY HUM GRAVEL AND THAT'S STUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUM SCRAPFLE CLAIND SILT AND THIS SAIL
Line_2023	ALL THETERCACE WITH THE PUMPED UP CIT
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PLANT MY LIKE CAP AND CA AND BOUSHES AND MORE CACIZE
Line_2025	THE LE HAS TO LOT MORE SANDS THEN IT DOES
Line_2026	GOOD B YEAH
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLY
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES AND THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT AS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S PLAIN ONE OF THE MIXED
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLASE REPETE THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THO THE SALT DISOLVETHE DISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEEN IT'S BULB TO PLAT AND NOT IT'S BEAN BIGGIESH
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_2035	YE
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	IT CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTE
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FIRST GOT THE E
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAIND ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED IN TO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU CAT IT HOW
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLID
Line_2044	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPERE
Line_2045	UM TIME LOTS OF LOTS OF TIME
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLUTOLVEN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THE THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITH OUT A SOLVENT OR A SOL IT WOULD NOT MAKE ACLUTIONMIXTER
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER IT WILL
Line_2053	THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOWER MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTION
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IN THE COP FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE SO MIX
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THE SKY OR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPORA
Line_2065	YOU PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAISE A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS
Line_2068	SPONS ARE FLOTING
Line_2069	E
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEATER OR BITTER
Line_2072	THEY ARE GOING TO BE UM HARD SWEATER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEATER AND THEY LOOK DENSER
Line_2074	THEY ARE DILUTED
Line_2075	THE LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU RE PEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATER OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD ETHER TAKE OUT FIFUM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY TICKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	L OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES A TASTER AND ONES OBSERVE
Line_2083	WHEICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON A SCAIL
Line_2084	ONE'S TEN GRA TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN OTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	UM SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION ON A SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENSITY HAS IS THE COR CAT IS LIGHTER THAN THE PONY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLO
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT THINKS
Line_2096	BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MAY HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THAN THINGS WOULD FLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THEN WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIXED
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A AM FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED AND GOT BACK
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRAM IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THEN THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BUT THE GOE BYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE SHOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ACID
Line_2109	BECAUSE UM IT
Line_2110	MOUNT HEAR
Line_2111	THE SAME CARE AND OUR SCIENCE AND NO BULBS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE I SAD
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SPIKE
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S LIKE
Line_2118	SEE AT AGAN SO WAS WHAT WAS YEAH YEAH HOW I DU
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SEAD THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NO
Line_2122	WE'VE BEEN DOING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANTS AND THEY REACT OFF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS A CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTEDS
Line_2126	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	ET'H TWO
Line_2128	THEY ARE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM DE NOFTHING THRONG M
Line_2130	IN SODA IC CALCIUM CAR ON EACH TO BE
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT'S A PRECIPITATES
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'RE AREA BE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO IF THERE IS NOFTHING HAVING JUST IS GETTING PUT IN IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWAT
Line_2135	THE WATERS CHANGING COLOR
Line_2136	IT'S PITY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS BUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIZZED AND I DON'T KNOW WHIE
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE ER
Line_2141	YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECAND ONE HAS NOT METAL
Line_2143	IF A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIX OR IF IT TURN HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	UM CALCIUM CLORED WATER AND SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY ER BLUE UP THE BAG AND THE FILED
Line_2147	THERE IS GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCE IS WEARED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CEMICAL REACTION ON SCAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE IS HAS MORE SALT
Line_2152	I MIS I TEN RATELTER AND RACHEL
Line_2153	I TOT ONE
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THEIR TWO AS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A TOPING STEEL
Line_2157	WELL FIRST THE VE SHICKE IT UP SO AND IT'S GONNA MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GO TO SETAL AND IT'S GO TURNED DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY THE SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT WAS MY FRENDY SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SE
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNET YING ON THE BOTTM OF THE SCREEN
Line_2164	DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES ARE ON CALLED
Line_2165	NO FARNEY YEAH
Line_2166	THEY'RE ALL HUNGER PROPERTIES SHOW AND THAT ALL
Line_2167	WE'RE LEARNING METER THE OT CON COR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNT OR A FORMIMANT OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	BYE BYE LESS
Line_2171	WIND WATER YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILLED THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STOWN AND THEN IT STARTED WEATHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF DRUM TO THEN HIT A CUP OF ROCKS AND TH SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
Line_2174	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVER TON AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A RO UNTO
Line_2176	THE BULBERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE
Line_2177	THEY HAVE TO GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE L HAS BEEN IN THEIR WEIGH MORE THAN THE BULBERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING PAMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN THE STREEN
Line_2179	CLUE ANYBODY THERE ARE DOL HADE AT ALL
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CEMICAL WEATHERING FISICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHAINGE DROPS
Line_2182	UM LET'S GO COM ON D YOU L
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER ASODRAIN THAT'S HITTING THE LIME STON AND DISCINEGARATING
Line_2184	FORTH WHAT IS WHAT IS A
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ASSID RAIN IS COMING DOWN SHIFKING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE LI
Line_2186	RAIN AND PURCIT
Line_2187	THE ROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT'S TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SAND STON THE RAIN FEREESE DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMIDGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIME STON AFTER ACSIRDRAIN AFTER A ER STEEL HAD
Line_2190	IT DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HELLO ANYBODY THERE
Line_2192	IT UBRAGED AND IROTED
Line_2193	ACSIDRAIN AND ALSO EROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CUT BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE WROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CUP BANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS KILLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ILONDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITON
Line_2199	THE SCREEN TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING MS IN CLASS
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND IRUION
Line_2201	EVERSION AND IT'S IN A AND A CANON
Line_2202	THE WATER CAME OUT AND LEFT THE TRAIL OF WATER I MEAN MUD
Line_2203	IT'S THE D
Line_2204	THE S TI I IM
Line_2205	POSITION DEPOSITION
Line_2206	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
Line_2207	IT'S A VALLY AND UM WHEN WE HAVE THE FLOW
Line_2208	I DON'T GO W
Line_2209	THE ROSION AND ERTH MATE CIRCUIT CARED AWAY
Line_2210	DOT DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT THING THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREEM TABLES
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS UM ALL THE WAY DO UNTO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE IS NOT A FING CLOSED TO THE BULB
Line_2213	THE FLAT IS MEANDERING AND THEN STEEL IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEE SLOP IS GOING VERY FLA FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOW IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND CORNERS
Line_2215	THE FLOUD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY UM DIPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GON UH
Line_2218	IT'S HIR IN THE FLOD
Line_2219	IT GOES FASTER
Line_2220	THE WATER RAISES EN EN THERE IS A FLOD
Line_2221	ERRQUI
Line_2222	PLAIGHTS IND THE ERTH MOVING
Line_2223	VBOALECINE RAPSHON
Line_2224	LANDS LIDE
Line_2225	IT'S THE AL ANG SLOW
Line_2226	ERE SLOWLY
Line_2227	I THINK SLOWSL
Line_2228	MINERALS
Line_2229	THE THEY ARE NOT ROCKS
Line_2230	MINLRILBES
Line_2231	WE USED THEM
Line_2232	MINERALES GO INTO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MANE
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCAIL TO SEE HOW HARD UM R ARE WE DID THIS AND CLASC
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPPANS HERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIMAND CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WIRES IT ALWAISE MAKE A MARK
Line_2237	IT DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	I KNOW NO WHEN SHE LIVES
Line_2240	THIS IS SO SAD I KNOW WHAT YOU LIVE
Line_2241	ONLY STUMBN PARENTS
Line_2242	LO AND SCRATCH THE TILE YEAH
Line_2243	IT MAKES JET A BATH
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH THE SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS MIXTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	DON'T
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GREP TA STICK
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WAHE
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LIGHTS UH
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T LUSE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST ADDS
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHAN
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOGH YOU CAN SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LUSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION IN THE END
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOL OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS SO
Line_2258	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT OT AND THE COPY FILE
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIX
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET HOT IN THE SO
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPE
Line_2263	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPER AND LEFT THE SOLED BEHIND THE CON
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE THE
Line_2266	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PRODUCTION AS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASHES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWISE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE T
Line_2270	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO SOLUTE CONE
Line_2272	THAT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
Line_2273	IT MEANS BYE
Line_2274	THE PANY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE COR
Line_2275	THE TENTY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTE
Line_2278	SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWED ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LITER IF WE ADD THE LITER SALT SOLUTION WAT THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON TOP
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION BE IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	USE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2286	THAT'S SO
Line_2287	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE EACH T
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SHOGER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_2295	FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THERE FOR IT WEIGH
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT AND THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAM
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UM
Line_2299	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH IT'S SOLUTION WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I TELL YOU THAT
Line_2303	THEY SATURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	ITN'T DUSE SCIENCE TODY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THERE IS BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORY
Line_2308	SOLVENT IS SOLUTE
Line_2309	THEY ARE LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICED THAT THE MOLECULES ARE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFERE
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT IT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE SALLITHINGS
Line_2314	THERE IS A PERIES CIPIT THERE IS A PRE CIPATE LEFT
Line_2315	YOU MIXED SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WATER AND THE HIDROLIC CORICK
Line_2316	THE SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE IS ALL ONE MOLECUL THE WATER IT HAS TWO TYPES OF MOLE
Line_2317	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE ICE
Line_2320	UM THERE WARE BUBS
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCT OF SHISING AND THEN IT SETALED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOW AND ON AND IT'S GETTING RUFS STEE
Line_2323	THE GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS THE CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2324	THE REST ON THE BIKI DON E
Line_2325	THE GLOW STICK STARTED GLOWING
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FILLS A LOT AND THEN THE SECUANT ONE DID FILE
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FIZZES AND HAS A PRECIPTAINE
Line_2329	YOU MADE IS THREE UHM
Line_2330	THAT BOTH THAT D
Line_2331	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEIR MOLECUES LOOKED
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LIRES IN THE BAG
Line_2335	A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND THE GASS
Line_2336	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA
Line_2337	A SOLID LIQUID AND THE GA
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE
Line_2339	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2340	THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BAG WEIGHS LESS
Line_2341	BECAUSE ONE OF THE BAXIS OPEN WHICH LET OUT ALL OF THE GASES
Line_2342	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL RMELAND
Line_2343	THERE IS HUMAN GRAVEL CLAIN AND SILT
Line_2344	HUMINS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILL
Line_2345	THEY ARE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2346	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2347	THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2348	L
Line_2349	UHH
Line_2350	THE
Line_2351	SOILS AND ROCKS AND LAND FORMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_2352	THERE IS WATER AND THEIR CRACS AND THE WATER E
Line_2353	A WAY THE RING HER I THINK IT WAS
Line_2354	FREASING AND ABRASION
Line_2355	UBBRATSON
Line_2356	THE WROLTS BREAKED PART
Line_2357	T I SAD WILL YOU MARY ME AND SHE SAD YES TREATS CAN BREAK RACTS APART GOOD THINKING
Line_2358	THE TREE IS GROWING DOWN AND LOOKING FOR WATER AND THE ROCK IS IN IT'S WAY SO THE TREE ROUGH BREAKES
Line_2359	THE THE THE ANDS FAVER
Line_2360	WHEN THE WATER FRAMSS IT EXPANS
Line_2361	THEY WERE LIKE ROLLED DOWN EVER AND THEN THEY LIKE BROK UP AND THE SMALLER PIECES
Line_2362	AS THEY GO DOWN THE PIECES GETS MORE
Line_2363	THE T GRAB
Line_2364	FING EXTREEMLY TERABLE TO DY SO YOU DON'T KNOW ANY AT
Line_2365	CCMICAL WEATHERING AND STUFF THINK THAT I GUESS
Line_2366	THE WIME STON IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE OF THE ACID
Line_2367	THE SALT IS MEN TO THE VINEGAR BUT THE LIME STONE CAN BE
Line_2368	U
Line_2369	BECAUSE OF TREMICALE VERY
Line_2370	I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY
Line_2371	WELL MUFTHING THROUGH BE HAPUNING TO THE STRACI SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_2372	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2373	IS FORMING THE LIME STOWN INTO IT
Line_2374	ONE YEAH
Line_2375	THE WATER IS WEATHERING WEIGH THE LIME STOWN TO MAKE THE CAVE AND SE YOU A LINE
Line_2376	TO ICE WETHERING I LEANING AND MORNING T TEN
Line_2377	YOU SHOED ME THIS LAST TIME AND I EXPLAIN IT ALREADY IT OR NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT AGAIN
Line_2378	DON ROW
Line_2379	OH I DIDN'T T HOW WON'T
Line_2380	AND IF THEY YOURE MADE OF BEES THAT MEANS
Line_2381	SPAN AND ER IBROWSE LOOK LIKE BA OF THE ROCK IS
Line_2382	THERE IS SCREEN BUT AND NTHERRING
Line_2383	AND THE WEATHERING HAVE BEEN THERE AND YOUR IYBROWUSE QUICK BY THE AS I SAID
Line_2384	BUT NE ANT NO WEATHERING E
Line_2385	BANANA WEATHERING HAS HAVE BEEN TO THE BANANA STATCHE WITH BANANA IBRAWS SO LOOK LIKE EARN IBROWS AND YOU'RE BANATA
Line_2386	I'M GOOD I'M VERY GOOD TODAY EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO DO TE CAP AND THAT'S NOT GO
Line_2387	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EROSION AND DEPOSITION
Line_2388	THE ONE ON THE SLOP GO DOWN MORE FARTHER THAN THE ONE ON THE NOSE SLOP T
Line_2389	WATER IT GOES MORE FASTER IF THERE IS MORE SLOP THAN IF THERE IS NO SLOP
Line_2390	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS LIKE THE WHERE IT'S STEEP THE WATER IS GOING MORE FASTER
Line_2391	THE WATER WENT THE SLOWP R
Line_2392	ON THE FLAT THE WATER IS FALLING SLOWLY AND ON THE STEEP SALTED THE WATERS AN
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FLUDTHINGS THAT WE DIDN'T STUFF
Line_2395	THE EROSION AND DEPOSITION AND THE FLAT WATER SOLUTION IN A BIGGER BIGGER IS GOING MORE FARTHER
Line_2396	ONE WITH FLOWED CONDICTIONS THE ERUION GOES MORE FARTHER
Line_2397	HEFLUD WATER IS MUOLTING FASTER
Line_2398	THE FLOUD WATER IS THING OF FUSST
Line_2399	THE FLOW OF WATER AND THE A CREEK IS MOVING A LIGHT FASTER
Line_2400	THE WATER WILL STU LOWING FAST
Line_2401	THERE'S THREE ROCKS AND AN ARDER THIS PURSON ISOM WHAT
Line_2402	UM WELL LIKE THE THE TWENTY FORTH SECANT I THINK THAT
Line_2403	IT'S UM SIDE WE DON'T HUH
Line_2404	DID YOU JUST SEE SOMETHING
Line_2405	THE SLOW CHAINS MADE THE OF IT
Line_2406	AND IT SO
Line_2407	YEA THE ARE
Line_2408	YOU DON'T LIKE TO HAVE BEN IT HAVE BEEN FASSALLY OR ALL THAT'S WHY WE T
Line_2409	HER ALL T
Line_2410	IT'S WAT YOU'RE CABIN VERY FACTALLY IT'S HABNING THERE JASALY
Line_2411	ESALLY THE VOLANIELS RING FASSALLY IT'S GOING MEA FASSOULY AND I BELIEVE IN AN OLD COLOR
Line_2412	FI BUT MARONEY SEE I DON'T LIKE YOU BUT WILL METAL
Line_2413	GOOD WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO
Line_2414	THEY I'VE ON IN POSITION HAPPNING AT THE THE SAME I
Line_2415	IT'S ARE AND
Line_2416	YOU HOW I'M DOING TODAY THAT'S MY BISNESS MIND YOUR ON
Line_2417	ROUGH WEN AND T BULSED SHELL
Line_2418	E LIKE STREEN TABLES AND STUFF N
Line_2419	LOVE TRAINEO LIKE THAT
Line_2420	IT AND UM BOTH RE LIKE
Line_2421	A VALLY MAY BE THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_2422	RELUTON YEAH
Line_2423	LIGHT UP
Line_2424	IT'S DTLUVUMI DON'T NO DOT
Line_2425	BUBLB AND DIS POSITION THE C IT MAKE THE
Line_2426	THE CLOSER SHARLV
Line_2427	'S UFF THAT OTHER STUFF AND THEN THE OTHER STUFF HAPPENS AND THEN WHEN THAT OTHER STUFF HAPPENS AND
Line_2428	ALL STUFF AND IT DOES STUFF TO MAKE VALLY BALLS ARE CREATE THAT'S
Line_2429	THAT WE ARE CREATED BY STUFF STUFF STUFF THAT LEAST ARE CREATED BY STUFF THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_2430	IT WAS NITHER ELUSION OR A DEPOSITION THAT CREATED THE STEEL IT WAS YOUR ACTUAL
Line_2431	THE ICIMORROWSE
Line_2432	THE POSITION
Line_2433	IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ERALLIER TO DAY ABOUT THE LIKE STUFF THAT LIKE BRO
Line_2434	THE DIMAND DISLO SHINY MORE SHINIER THAN THE IPSOMR
Line_2435	MINERALS ARE MORE LIKE MEINERALES THAN ANY MINERAL AND A BARBER MUCH E
Line_2436	I DON'T KNOW I KNOW I'M BISY WASCHING FROM
Line_2437	I DON'T AND I KNOW I AM I AM LOWING THE FROGS
Line_2438	I NOM
Line_2439	IT'S A MO HARDNESS
Line_2440	THE THING AND THEN I THINK DIMANS RIGHT AGAIN
Line_2441	E
Line_2442	THE DIMAND DRAW A WIN ON
Line_2443	THE HARD MIS
Line_2444	I JUST DRUM ON YOUR FACE WITH THE SHARP BEING SORRY MANE
Line_2445	THE BRIGHTNISS WELL THIS CONNECTS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CAUSE WE MADE FLASHLIGHTS
Line_2446	THE SALT WANTS TO S TO DO AND IT WENT WE WILL BE MADE OF LIGHT FLASH IT'S
Line_2447	UM I SA SO YOUR ROCKS AND IN FOOL
Line_2448	BRIGHT NES
Line_2449	THEY WOKE AN MORE DIFFERENT OR
Line_2450	IS ON ONE TWO
Line_2451	AND HOW LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS AR THE SHADOWS ARE IN THAT MINERAL
Line_2452	LIKE BRIGHTNESS
Line_2453	SOMEBODY CREACT TO A ROCK WITH THE PICK AX
Line_2454	OUN'TERALLY MA AN YOU EN ANE THE METAL JUST HAVING F PLAYING WITH YOUR
Line_2455	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTUNCH AND I WAS DIS PLAYING WITH YOUR ER A PROGRAM
Line_2456	IT'S MARKAN
Line_2457	MIC TILE GOT IT'S D ON IT
Line_2458	IT CAME FROM THE MINERALE
Line_2459	THERE THAT I NOTICED THAT THE IS TO RIGHT HAND IT'S CREEPY F
Line_2460	YOU WOULD NEAD THE LUSTER THO BREAK THE STREAK THE HARDNESS
Line_2461	IT DID NOT ROLL OUT ANY OPHIONE
Line_2462	THIS MANTEXIBITED A CLEE
Line_2463	THAT IS A STREEK TESC
Line_2464	I THINK THAT IT IS JIPSOM
Line_2465	YEAH M
Line_2466	THAT IT DID NOT SCRATCH
Line_2467	BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY BOTH SCRATCH
Line_2468	IT TELLS US THAT THIS MINERAL CAN BE GRADE OR JIPSO
Line_2469	THE MALIDES MY BULECALCIE FLORD GALENE AND GOLD
Line_2470	BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIT WITH DISCRIPTION
Line_2471	YO YEAUHM
Line_2472	IT FRACTURES
Line_2473	BECAUSE THEY CUEIVE INSTEAD OF FRACTURE
Line_2474	BECAUSE THE ROCK WE HAD FRACTURED BUT THOSE ONES DID
Line_2475	WE CAN CROSS OUT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR A QUART TO Y
Line_2476	YE YEAH I GUESS
Line_2477	WE HAVE QUORTS
Line_2478	THEY HAVE NEARATOUR OPTIONS DOWN THE QUORTS
Line_2479	ABSOLUTLY NO THING
Line_2480	EAMSOM
Line_2481	DEFORNATLY E
Line_2482	I ME NOW
Line_2483	CAR I'M JUST LIKE WACHING THE COAL THING IT'S SO IGMEIES ROCKS YOU KNOW IT'S IF
Line_2484	YOUR METORALRIROCKX I'M JUST PLAYING WITH THE ARNIE S RA SO HOT
Line_2485	IN AND STUFF MORGAY
Line_2486	IT RELATES TO SOME MENERAL STUFF
Line_2487	A MINERALE PROPERTIES TABLE
Line_2488	MINERAL IDENTIFICATION SHARES
Line_2489	THIS WAS USFAL I DENTIFYING MINERALS LIKE
Line_2490	I YOUN'T ME THAT R
Line_2491	UM HARDNESS I JUST SAID THAT'S ARE YOU ASKING ME AGAIN BUT YEAH I JUST SAT HARD
Line_2492	YEAH BUT SOME OF IS FINGS DON'T WORK
Line_2493	HOW ESALLY OUT DONLL GET CILLED TO DETH ARNEL THAT'S THAT'S TESTING THE BREAK
Line_2494	YEAH MAN
Line_2495	UM UM UHM THE COLOR
Line_2496	NOW
Line_2497	JUST NO ON
Line_2498	IT'S IN D TIL IM IS
Line_2499	MU THINGS THE FINGER NAIL DIDN'T SCRATCH AT YOU
Line_2500	NOT LETTING YOU PRESS THE GREEN AROW
Line_2501	MEANS THIRBY CURENT YOU KNOW ARE THAT S
Line_2502	AL THEY DIDN'T BUT THE HOW WAS SOPPOSEDO
Line_2503	THAT THEY THERE ARE TWO SOFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT RE LETS OFF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BALNCSING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BALUNSING OFF EVERY THING AND AND AWAY
Line_2509	REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BALANCING OFF ALL THE METERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT AND THE MITAL
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WIGHT LIGHTS
Line_2515	IT'S WIGHT
Line_2516	EVERYWUARE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISUM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLACS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BE BECOMES BLUE
Line_2520	THE R HEADING METL IS SWIGHT AND THE RAYS COMING OFF THE BULB ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBSORBED BY THE BLUE BULBE
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECT IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IT IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BUBLB AND THEN THE
Line_2524	I THINK IT GIT'S OBSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BULB
Line_2525	THE BULB IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPERE TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNGREEY
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE ONES BEHIND IT BERNS OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TWO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WRK
Line_2537	CAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE IS FER
Line_2539	IT'S CLIVED BYE IT IT'S NOW
Line_2540	EACH ANIMALE HAS TO PLACE IN THE EGEOR SISTM AND THEY ARE P
Line_2541	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCING THE FIELD FOR FOR T
Line_2542	POLATS UM
Line_2543	BEING A PRODUCE ER MEANS UM YOU PRODUCE THE ENERGY HEAR SO
Line_2544	A PLANT MAKES THE SODA ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND UM DIRT
Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE PRODUCED
Line_2546	IT MEANS IT YOU EAT OTHER THINGS TOGEHE
Line_2547	ANIMLES EAT OTHER ANIMLES AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN STILL THE ENERGY TOGETHER
Line_2549	WE GET THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DED ON AND ANIMALS THEY CAN
Line_2550	YOU ALL MIGHT EAT PLAS AND ERB
Line_2551	POLANSE
Line_2552	PORES ONLY YOU P
Line_2553	AMBALBS BEER LINES PULL THE HUNTEES YEAH AT MOST
Line_2554	PRIMARECAON
Line_2555	AND OM THE R
Line_2556	EARBEVORIN
Line_2557	THEY ARE DCAMPOSER
Line_2558	A TEACHRID
Line_2559	THEY TURN THE LE S IN SIDE
Line_2560	THEY TURNS INTO DARK
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARND HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAIN THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SALT
Line_2567	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID IN THIS MIXTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES IS DISSOLVING
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND THE RESULT HAS ALL OF THE S REASONS AND AIM
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWES THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIX DRORE
Line_2578	BY BUTTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILLTE ABOUT A SOLUTE AND A A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WAIT NO IT'S A SOLUTION SARY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED UP THE WATER GREAP TA STICK IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCAIL TO TELL WHITCH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO N
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	THEY WOULD TAKE SHIGRIER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAD SO
Line_2593	THE TAIST IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS S
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COLD BY HOW MUCH WATERS IND THE COLD
Line_2597	I AM HAVING A BAD DAY MARNEY
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TYPE OF GASSWAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK STEEL OR TWO ISN'T CREATED
Line_2601	CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TURN IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDAL IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE REACTIN
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THEERE IS A BUBBLY ME
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING AND WA WATER IS MICING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MAUSSE OVER THE THINGS MOLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE S
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APART
Line_2611	THE REACTANT MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PRODUCT MOLECULE
Line_2612	REPEAT THESE
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE A MOLECULE AND THE SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING MOLECULES FROM THE HIDROLICK ACID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT SO
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEARE AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FIZZED UP AND THEN CALMED DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SCTRAN PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A TEMICAL REACTION HERE I NO THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT F
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ON TO THE PANE RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NO THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BYE MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FIND MAKING SAMBWAGHES RIDING ON COINS AND PLAYING MORE
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2627	THE SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFOR T WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATED
Line_2630	THE TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED AND THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAID ON THE TOP
Line_2634	ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THINGE HEAR IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATE
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DOES
Line_2638	ALLEN MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM UM NOT QUIT SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE WA
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	UH PARDAN ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE OUR PET THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALTS IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT I'M IS IT A QUARVLENT S
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED ERBLE
Line_2648	WELL THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	ONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY
Line_2650	THATS TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	GOOD BY YOU'RE MY BESTIEST FEREND
Line_2656	WHAT YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	UM THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICAL SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALLED THEM TOOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SHURE MARNEY UM BALANCE ON IT
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BAD
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MAGNET
Line_2661	I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WEE HAVE BEEN STUDIING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS AL MORE GRIP TASTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE DARK COLORD SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORD SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAST REALLY GROWS AND JUST REALLY DISCUSS THING AND YEAH THIS REALLY H IT REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAST PRITY LAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION OUT IT MIGHT TAST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLANE AND A LOT MORE TASTLESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GRAIN MARNEY HOW ARE YOH I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND AN OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YO UM KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WON'T YOU YOU CAN UNLESS YOU TAST IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THES SOLIDS IN IT THEY ARE DIFFERENT PROPER
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND A SE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZE
Line_2685	TO TACK THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEE AND THE STONS STAYED ON TO
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES HAIR THAN THE COLES AND THE SEE THE WROCKS ARE LARGE
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COPY FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COPY FILE
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS TROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPALT THAT SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOU ARE PUTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
Line_2692	TODAY MARNEY WE LEARND HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUT A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PRODUCTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW H UP
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SEE IS THE MOST DILUTE AND BE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2698	I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2700	THE PEANY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORT
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THE PANEY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOW
Line_2703	I'M OKAY UN CRUCHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPEAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY'RE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE H
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT UM I'M NOT SHURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTALLY WE'VE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2723	IT BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVAN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGTURED THE SALT BY WAY
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHIGAERER MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH A SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAN
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE SE IS SALT AR MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WEIGH CRYSTAL
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPUMSALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
Line_2737	I'M DOING GRATE HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST CAN AVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CEMICAL REACTION IS HAPINING
Line_2740	CEMICALE REACTION
Line_2741	REACTANTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE EEN DOING IN SCIENCE EVE IN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILE DESS I CAN'T GETS A REACTANT
Line_2745	SOLVAN
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS LOTS OF WEARED STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAASS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASS
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GASS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERY FOLGY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKE BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED OFF AND FIT A LOT
Line_2754	THERE IS SOME LITTLE WIGHT STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY ARE MISSING SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WITH HI DRAW
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECUMES REALLY BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A LITTLE A FYOU OF THEM TURNED PURPLE
Line_2757	IT'S A UM THEY'RE MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NO SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACT THING
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PAIN
Line_2760	THE FINEL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ON CANT THAT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFFINETLY A REACTION HAPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FIZZING
Line_2763	THE WA THE BUBBLES AND THE CARBON WASHER ARE CARBON B
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOLKING INTO ITS BONE
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST RE
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPINING TO THE PIPE
Line_2768	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPINING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ACURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE EVENTRAL MASSIS
Line_2776	THIS TELLS US THAT
Line_2777	IT I'M REALLY SIDED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNEY
Line_2780	MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MIX THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE S THE RASONS AND THE EMINEMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PINS RAISONS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO OTHER OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPANS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT MOST TOTALLY DISINEGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH TE
Line_2786	A SOLUTION
Line_2787	SOLUTE
Line_2788	A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN BECAUSE IT'S EARLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR STICK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	MARNEY I AVELUT OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYEL YOU IN YOUR WORST
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GOING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMIL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLACE A SOLVENT A L E ALL GET ALL
Line_2797	SARY MARNEY HAVE TO GO CAN S YOU BETTER BY
Line_2798	I'M DOING GRAGHT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE ARE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH THE FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TWOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE SAM IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCK SO THE ROCK DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DUS
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEVLES ARE BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THROUGH THE SPAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE WHOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT TAN PROPERTY IS PEBLES ARE GETING STUCK IN THE FAN TAP MARNEY
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPERCLIPS
Line_2807	UH SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCK CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBLES THE SMALLER PEBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU CAN PICK THEM AND THAN IT TAKES A WIRE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK ON TO THE
Line_2811	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET SO WORKED ON TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WAS BACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALIZED THAT THE PEBLES GET STUCK IN THE SCREEN
Line_2814	USE THE SEEM SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBBLE
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPAND WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBBLES GOT STOCK AND THE FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT WILL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VEAPPERY SHINE
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNEY
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU MA
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TO DIFFERENT RE SOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GREAP TAC STICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	THE ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAS MORE SLAVER
Line_2827	ONE WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	IT HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	SWEATER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER SWETER AND GREAPIER
Line_2832	ADD MORE GRAPE TA STICK
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN CAKE BYE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE'S R
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SHIGER
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPNING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE STAIEL
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE E IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE IS CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION TURN
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DISCRIPION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PIXTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFY SALAD BEAMS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARET AND TO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARET GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLE
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPEN S IT WENT BACK TOGETHER AND THEN IT IS PORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALTS WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALLED THEM A SOLUTE
Line_2863	THE SAND STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLE THE WATER IS FLOWING AND THIS MIXTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW ONE'S SARY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE ROLES PLACE AND THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WASHER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WEIGH MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE MA
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREIGHTER
Line_2877	A MIXTURE
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MAIN
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MAM
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE MEY MAM BUT WHY DO YOU CEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWING AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO AN UH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	M HORABLE TO DAY THINGS FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINDY GRAMS AND THE FER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAVE AND IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PRODUCTION MY PRODUCTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SARY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECUAND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SOARY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST THAT'S THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DITURNMIN IS BY TASTING T
Line_2900	WE ARE SEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND THE OTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASSES
Line_2909	YOU I DENTIFIDE THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUB ITS
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLE
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING ATEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CEMICALES
Line_2917	IT'S A EDITION PROBLUM
Line_2918	I'M I DON'T KNOW I'M SOARY
Line_2919	THE BACK CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MOR
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER IS AND I NO THAT QUASTIRON OP TO THE WATER
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A MIXTURE
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE THEY ARE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS A CREEN
Line_2927	THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURAE AND IT'S WARE TO A MALE OBJECTS OR TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE THE TWO ALL MIX OR
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING RAISANS AND MANMS OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR ON PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER
Line_2934	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SANS STAID ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SOL DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAM
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SAL SOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE POWRT NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	WE CALLED THAT A SOLUTE
Line_2944	BECAUSE THE GRAPE STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED IN THE OTHER AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THE SAME PROPERTY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE GREDIANT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE OF A SOLUTE
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE
Line_2953	THE SOL E THE SOLID SOL
Line_2954	E IS WE ONE INGREDA THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVENT
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURE
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LUSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_2958	THEY CEP THEIR SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NETHER THE WATER OR THE SALT LUSES ANY MA
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SOME CRYSTAL
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX STRAW AND THE SH STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF IT'S PRODICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX ST
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2965	SAPORATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF A SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SEPARATE TH
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE WAY TO SEPARATE THE SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	R IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEIR PROPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILLS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MA THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ALL PARNICAL SIZE IT'S CAL THEN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	THE PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN AS PARNICAL SIDE
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	POTICAL SIZE ANDMAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PARTICAL SIDE AND MAGNETISOM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOLES FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WEIGH WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNET IN
Line_2981	I NOTICE THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS STAYDED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILL WHEN THE OTHER THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY THING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STADED ON TOP
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BES FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	IT DON'T GO FARD BY
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE A
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PUPLE STU
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MALL THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATI
Line_2991	THE LIGHT LOW SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLEGRA POWDER WOULD TA SMALL LIKE CREAM AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TACE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRA
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UM ONE WITH LESS GRAY POWDERWE'LL TAST MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TAST IS NOT AS THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WA MAR
Line_2998	BY MARTY
Line_2999	BEAD
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU COAN'T TEL IF IT'S MORE CONCANT SHAKATED IF IT'S DARK
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3003	M PARDICION WAS RAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRACTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRAST
Line_3006	BYE THE ARE WEIGH IT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRACTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS SO IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	UM THE ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONE
Line_3009	HI
Line_3010	WE LEARNED ABOUT SATEWATION
Line_3011	THE COLK IS LESS DENSED THAN THE PANY AND THE PANY IS MORE DENSED THAN THE COLE
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	IN THE SOLUTION THEY WOULD THINK AND THEN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	U CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRACTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
Line_3016	THE MORE ONE WILL STINK TO THE
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WE'LL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS STANCE WILL GO INTO THE
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYS AT THE DOOR
Line_3019	THE ORDENCITY CAME THAT THE ORDICITY BECAME THE SAME
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SONK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHT ONE
Line_3021	IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREEN HAS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS GRAMS THEN IT
Line_3022	SEE YOU THEIRS DAY
Line_3023	UM WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTIN
Line_3024	IT'S FOLGY AND THIS IT'S OBLNDED INTO
Line_3025	THEY ARE TWOS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP MY
Line_3027	THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	TREACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP MY
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN
Line_3031	THEY HAVE TO PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THEN LOOK AND MALE A
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FULL SCOOPS IT IT AT ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF ESOM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING ALUMIN SOME HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD AND THE WAR
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DCITYE'S STUFF
Line_3035	DENCITY YEAH AND CONSALE AND SATURRA
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUFF SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBSITANT NUMBER AND
Line_3040	I'M DOING O UM
Line_3041	IMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	YEAHREON S
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDL IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLED THESE REACTANTS
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM C THEY'RE SAME PROD
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW IT PLEASE HELP M
Line_3049	I DON'T H
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORA
Line_3051	ALL OF THEM MOLECUES AND THE DIFFERENT UM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UM
Line_3052	IT CAN BE SEPARARTED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE ERTH WILL ALWASE BE UNTERRTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPER MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE COMFERENT BASON AMOUNTS
Line_3055	THE L I TIPS ARE FLOWTING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FARTHER
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLBE
Line_3058	A CUMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	IT'S NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTING TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BE WHICH MAKES THE CANNLICREACTION WHICH ADDS RUS TO THE
Line_3062	A CEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE LOW STICK IS UM COMING FOLDED AND HATE
Line_3063	THE CLOSE STICK IS BEING IT GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
Line_3064	YES THE MICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FILL IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDCATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	CONSULVATION
Line_3066	A CMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPEND HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPINING WHEN THE GRAM TEST IS ADDED TO THE WATER
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK THE CEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	IN ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CAM IF CEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING F OR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE UM NOTI SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE U
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THE MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW A
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKING APART
Line_3075	THE THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING M
Line_3076	IT CAN YOU REPETE WHAT YOU
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FILTER
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULLED ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT'S LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED
Line_3080	UM WE CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPERES AND GOES INTO THE MOLECUES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NO D
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	H I ONES CENTENTS M
Line_3085	COULD HIT YOUR FACE WHY U SO A
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3087	THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPER
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPEARE AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT WAS AFTER BEING MIXED WITH COU F WATER
Line_3090	IT'S SOLVENT
Line_3091	EVEN THO THE SALT DISAPPERES IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE UM
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	I CAN FIRE
Line_3095	HOLDING UP STANDS THERETHEARIN
Line_3096	THIS SALT DISAPPERED AND NO IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER
Line_3097	A SOL SHIN I MAKE PLA INTO GET HE'S RATHER MORE THAN RIGHT
Line_3098	IT IT MAKES GUESS AND A SOLUTION NOR
Line_3099	THE CITRIC ACID DISAPPEARED INTO THE WATER
Line_3100	WE CLULED THE NOIAN
Line_3101	WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_3102	THE SALTS GET YOU
Line_3103	SHE IS REALLY CREEPY
Line_3104	AKERS INSIDE THE MELTING OF THE RA
Line_3105	YEAH THE ARI BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING ANDY
Line_3106	RE
Line_3107	CAUSE IT IS A SOLUTION IN SCIENCE IS COAL AND A P
Line_3108	THEY ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MOLTIPLE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY WO
Line_3109	BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE RUSH TO THE MIXTURE
Line_3111	THE GRAVEL'S TWO BIG TO FIT THROUGH US
Line_3112	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL GOES THROUGH IT BUT THE WATER WILL
Line_3113	THE SAFETY PAS ARE MAGNETIC THES OTHERS ARE NOT
Line_3114	MAGNETISM AND MAGNETS
Line_3115	A SCUEEN

Line_3117	SODAY I GET UH THE SAFTY CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC AND THEY ONLY METAL AND THOSE F
Line_3118	BE CELLS HI
Line_3119	I WAS SOLUTE
Line_3120	YEAH
Line_3121	DRY MIXTURES AND HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3122	ADIOS NOT SO AMEGOS
Line_3123	GRIP TA STICK STUFF GETTING TORED AND MIXED WITH WATER
Line_3124	DON'T NO
Line_3125	ONE IS IS URCER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3126	THEY WAS TRANSEPARRENTY
Line_3127	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR C
Line_3128	E ON MUCH WENTS PA WENT AND
Line_3129	THERE WAS LESS POWDER AND THE ON THE WATER AND YOU A ERGY BALANCED
Line_3130	IT'LL BE SWEATER
Line_3131	THE TAST OK I NOTICE SOMETHING WELL THERE IS A THREE SPOONFULS FOR THE SIX SPONES AND THERE IS A SIX OMFUL SO THE EE SPOON
Line_3132	THE LEAST D PUT LESS WATER AND ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THAT A
Line_3133	THE WATER

Line_3135	MIXTURES AD SOLUTION ONE'S DISSOLVE AR SOLUTION AND ONE'S A GRAM SOLUTION
Line_3136	THE DENSITY AND THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT NESS OF EACH
Line_3137	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLID ONE HAS TWENTY
Line_3138	THE GRAMS SOLID WEIGH MORE THAN THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE

Line_3140	THE ONES TO THE RIGHT ARE GETTING DENSER
Line_3141	TO DO IT'S NOT FONECA MORNERABLY
Line_3142	THE THIRD ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE SEC
Line_3143	I THINK THE SEC ONE IS THE LEAST GOT
Line_3144	THE SECUANT IS THE MOST DILUTED OR AT LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3145	I HAIGHTE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE A
Line_3146	SYO LIKE ON BILE STEEL

Line_3155	THERE STEEL SOM SOLIDS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR
Line_3156	THEY'RE DOING THE EXACTAIM THING BUT JUST WEIGH SHIGAR
Line_3157	IT'S GETTING LIKE IT CAN WELL THE SHIGER ANY LONGER
Line_3158	THE FLOW BE SOME YOU CAN GET EVERYONE IN THE WAR NO NOT THE SAME ABOUNT
Line_3159	YOU MIND THE BE C O ONE'S FIFTY IT QUE SHIN AND WE ALL LEARN THAT IN COUNTER E
Line_3160	WE CHEIES AND THAT AN WE FORGOT ITS I S IT
Line_3161	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T ONE VERY SMALL AND I UM WHEN YOU C
Line_3162	BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MASS O
Line_3163	WE HAD A WE HAD A SO EACH TIME THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT IT'S LIKE LIKE LIKE WHICH FORM WAS WITH
Line_3164	E FORGET I DON WAN'T THAT I I GO
Line_3165	YOU'RE PULLRING THE VINEGAR AND THE RLUTINE BAKING SODA INTO A WATER THAT
Line_3166	A CHEMICAL REACT
Line_3167	I FORGOT MARNEY
Line_3168	THE VINEGAR IS REACTANT THE BAKING SODA IS REACTANT AND THE AND THE WA LIKE THE CUP IS A PRODUCT
Line_3169	IT SHOW HAVE BEN REPETE THAT ER SHA
Line_3170	A TEMICAL REACTION
Line_3171	REAPUTAM
Line_3172	REACTING
Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK BUT I THINK I I THINK THEY'RE WIRES
Line_3174	I SEE IN THE VINEGAR I SEE OCIGIN AND
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCROAGIENE AND H ATTUMS AND A VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEANS THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT POWDERS
Line_3177	THE ATTOM IS HAS TO BE DIFFERENT
Line_3178	IT'S FIZING FOR LONG RONG RONGED
Line_3179	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER

Line_3181	IT'S BASIN BAKING KING IN A DIRECTLY CO
Line_3182	PARTICIPATE AND THAT A IT'S CA
Line_3183	UH HERE WOULD BE D
Line_3184	IT WELL E EM RE BLUE EM RE BLUE
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE E GAS THAT'S SO
Line_3186	THERE WAS REACTION NO BUT THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS BEL REALLY COAL AND I LIKE OH
Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SOBSTANCEIS POURED INTO THE MIDALE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FASED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NO WITH KHE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BULB
Line_3190	IT STARTED FING SO AND ONE IS FING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE K HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE ER
Line_3192	IT GUETS TURN GREAN TEL IS GRAY T
Line_3193	EEMICAL REACTION EXCURED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNS GREIN WITH THE TRIP OF CURRENT FLOW
Line_3194	IT IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TURN
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER TURNS PURPLE IT USE TO BE BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THE RATS CAUSE I DIS TURNING PUT THE WATERS TO NING PAPE
Line_3197	IT DIDN'T WELL NO IT DIDN'T THERE WAS TO MUCH IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST LIKE STAYED WHERE
Line_3198	WE COULD EVA
Line_3199	THE WA YOU CLOSED IN IT WHEN OU
Line_3200	THERE IS REACTION TO THE CALCIUM CORIDE AND THEE
Line_3201	I THINK UESS I SHE LIKE ON TO A SALAD
Line_3202	I SEE B I SEE GRAY AND I SEE SILVER I THE GASSES A OVER THE LIQUIDS YELOW
Line_3203	THEY'RE WEIGHING TWO ON TWO DIFFERENT SCAILES N
Line_3204	THE THE ONE WITH THE BACK CLOST IS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN BECAUSE IT HAS AIR IN SIDE IT TRAPS IN SIDE OF IT
Line_3205	THE AIR MOLECULES OR TRAP INSIDE THE CLOSED BAG BUT LET OUT AND BALANCED INSIDE THE OPEN BAG
Line_3206	WE'VE BEEN MAKING HUHMS FORRRIGLARS
Line_3207	OUR HUMAN BODIES T
Line_3208	THIS IS A PART OF THE SISTUM
Line_3209	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_3210	EVERYTHING SOPORTS THE CAR
Line_3211	THIS HOLE BODY IS A SICTAM
Line_3212	IT'S TELLING YOU WAT WHAT PART OF THE SISTOM IT IS
Line_3213	IT TELLS THINGS THAT THEY IT
Line_3214	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SOUPPOURT THE SHOMAN BO
Line_3215	ER BRATING MUCH EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT A SISTAM
Line_3216	I THINK IF DOES AS COUNTRIES IF AND MIXIS

Line_3223	THEY ALL HAVE THEY ALL HAVE LAND
Line_3224	IT LOOKS LIKE UM Y UM HOW FOR CHAIN
Line_3225	WE D THEN GETTING THE LIKE ANIUMLES EATING OTHER PLANTS
Line_3226	I NO AT THIS THAT UM BOAT'S BUBS CAN HAVE LOTS OF ATER
Line_3227	THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME BUT THE ANIMAL SAME IS
Line_3228	AT I'M LEARNING ABOUT CATERPILLRS AND PER THINGS COMPOSER
Line_3229	THEY IT COMPOSERS D C POSES AND CIRCUANDARY O
Line_3230	COMPOSERS DICOPOERS AND ICE GLASS ACID
Line_3231	BAR OFF IT'S ICY LIKE ARE SO
Line_3232	I GOT YEAH
Line_3233	W THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
Line_3234	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCE
Line_3235	BEING A COMPOSERS YEA EAT THE PRODUCER SO THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEI'RE IN
Line_3236	COMPOSER IT'S THE COMCUMARY
Line_3237	THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUMER
Line_3238	THE CAT HAVE TO BONY AND THE AND UM THE BEARAIDE AND THE SIR

Line_3241	IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING M
Line_3242	FINISH I STOPED TO FINISH IT THE CARNOVARS UMLERS CLOSED WA
Line_3243	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIJUEST
Line_3244	THEY THEY ALL GET A
Line_3245	THE PRODUCERS AND THIS THE COSUMARS AND MUSIC A CORE
Line_3246	THE PRODUCORS THE COMPOSORS AND CONSUMERS
Line_3247	THEY GUE THEIR OWN IN
Line_3248	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY GIVING THE UM THE PRODUCE ARE IX THE PRODCITS THEY IT'S TEGY IT NEEDS
Line_3249	I CO SUMMERATS THE ONE THAT EATS TO PRODUCE TO GET IT'S ENERGY
Line_3250	THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE CONMTBCAUS IT CAN MATES THE PRODUCER
Line_3251	A SOL THAT EATS PLANTS
Line_3252	AH SO ON THE EATS PLAS AND
Line_3253	SICSTUMS
Line_3254	CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_3255	IT IS ABOUT THE FODWEL AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_3256	THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM
Line_3257	ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THE GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PROTY SOME M
Line_3258	A D C COMPOSER IS ALL ABOUT D COMPOSERS
Line_3259	THEY'RE IMPORTANT IF YOU DO WILL BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO D COMPOSE THE DED ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
Line_3260	WE TALK FIRST SECUANT AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMERS
Line_3261	AND OUR REOR IS THE HERE IT EATS PLAIN
Line_3262	A CARON OF WAR IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AND OTHER AND OTHER BARIES AND MEAT
Line_3263	THEY MEAN IN SIDE OF THEIR AIR
Line_3264	OTHERS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_3265	THEY WOULD EAT DEDD PLANTS IN IT
Line_3266	THIS IS A D COMPOSER OR RED LAR WARM IT D COMPOSES DED PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN IT INTO SOIL
Line_3267	THE RED WARM IS A D COMPOSED
Line_3268	D COMPOSERS CREATES SAIL RITCH AND SOIL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR SPECIES AS RITCH AND SAIL
Line_3269	THE WAIST MATERIALS TURN ON THE RICH AND SOIL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEAKS

Line_3284	HAM ARNEY HOW YOU DO WON'T F
Line_3285	IT'S A SITTHAT'S BELT TOGETHER
Line_3286	WELL YOU'RE A SISTAM BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A COMPOITER THAT'S RIGHT
Line_3287	I WON'T HAVE A SCIENCE CLASS BUT IT IS A SISTM I MEAN ELLIMENTRY NOT NO MIDDL SCOEL
Line_3288	MAM HA ANA LLIS VIAL LUIS ILLULISE
Line_3289	IT IS STOP BBOCXING MY MARNEY CAN HEAR YOU
Line_3290	THAT IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SELL SOMETHING
Line_3291	IT IS A SICTOM AND IT IS HEA
Line_3292	IT IS SHOWING THE DIJECTIVE SISTM THE RECPRATOARY SISTM AND THE SELLS
Line_3293	THE RESPATORY SISTOM
Line_3294	THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE HARDEST PART OF THE REPRTORY SISTOM
Line_3295	THAT ONES AGAIN WE'RE WRONG PART RESPOTORYUT
Line_3296	IT IS SPILLED UP OF MANY GRAVEAND POLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE ERTH T
Line_3297	IT IS A SISTOM GOD I DON'T HAVE TO RIGHT THIS DOWN BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT ERTH
Line_3298	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ERTH GRAVETACIONAL PULE MOVE
Line_3299	YEAH SAME THING OR PLEASE WANT YOU LIVE ON AN THE MAIN LET'S GO
Line_3300	EST DOES NOT IN A HUMAN HEAVIER
Line_3301	THEY'RE ABOUT A MILLIAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MANYI DON'T THINK WE EVER LEARN ABOUT
Line_3302	BILE ER IS ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE INFACT RIGHT NOW I'M ON THE BE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE CECUANT FLOOR
Line_3303	THE BYBLES FAR IS MADE OF GRASS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER LIKE ON THE ARML THING
Line_3304	THERE IS A DESERT A BAR FOREST AND
Line_3305	THEY ARE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THI
Line_3306	THE REST OF THE BILES FAIR IS MADE OUT OF LIKE NOT LIKE WHAT LAMS AND STUFF I DON'
Line_3307	YOU'RE NOT MY FREND ANYMORE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
Line_3308	FOR AS I AM HOW TO COMPUTOR
Line_3309	LE WHAT'S
Line_3310	THES STUDY THING WE CAN'T MUCH AGAIN
Line_3311	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE EST IS BRAKING IT'S STORM AND SEE
Line_3312	THAT THE E IS BAKING IT'S DORMANCY I JUST SAID THAT YEAH
Line_3313	IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS E
Line_3314	THAT THEY ARE YEAH I ON'T HEAD ES FOR MY EXIPBOCKXSE
Line_3315	HOW DID YOU DON'T PUT IN THE TRACH AGAIN
Line_3316	THAT THE E IS ER THE
Line_3317	THE ONE WE PLANT DIDN'T GET ENUFF STUFF
Line_3318	THAT IT GRO THE PINTS STURED OUT AS THE SEED AND THEN TURN TO THE PLA
Line_3319	IT MADE WATER SUNLIGHT AND STEEL TWO
Line_3320	SPACE FOR HIM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SORVIVE CONCUMANTS NEED WATER JUST EVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WAIR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUID
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUD
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AR BUT MATTERS ON IF IT STEEL TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON DO NO SIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OCXIGION FORUS
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF THE SISTOM
Line_3327	YES BECAUSE IT COULD DRY THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBERGER I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBERERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOD SO NO
Line_3330	IT SHOWS PLANT WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR THE FOM AND THE SIROME
Line_3332	THOSE ARE SINGAL CELL ORGANISUMS OR E
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH MIS BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	BUT THEY'RE IN MUSL SELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE THE EXERCSIZE
Line_3337	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS FROM MUSSLS
Line_3338	THAT THEY ARE A PART OF THE BARNEY
Line_3339	I SEE SKIN SO
Line_3340	THAT THEY MAKE UP YOUR SCIN
Line_3341	L AND RECPERATL MADE THE THE SCILLTOLE DIJESTIVE NERVIS MUCULAR AND REPRTORIO CISTOM
Line_3342	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE OUT OF FER
Line_3343	HOW YOU PUT ON CIPIAT OUR TRIOMS
Line_3344	THEY ALL FORM THE CEPRATORY THEM
Line_3345	IT LONG THE BROWNKIDE THAT E FLAM IS THE BROM KILA TICKS A MOUNT
Line_3346	IT CEPS HOUR A BODY AND HIDE
Line_3347	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE RED HUMAN BODY BREATH YEAH
Line_3348	YOUR NAME IS ABOUT PARTY WITH LE
Line_3349	TO PROVIDE YOUR HOT BODY WITH OCXIGNE IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR BODY WITH OCXIGIN YOU'RE BOY WILL
Line_3350	ABOUT THE HUMAN MESPRATORY SISTAM
Line_3351	THAT IS THE AVL WITCH IS
Line_3352	THIS IS U THIS IS THE HUMAN DISSPLAY OF THE HUMAN ER
Line_3353	L IF YOU THE UM UM DRAK MOUTH NOES BEAN
Line_3354	THE RECPRATORY CSISTOM ALLOWS A HEUVEN BODY TO BREAT
Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECAND WALLS BREATHING
Line_3356	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR SELLS TO GET OCIGEN AND CARRY THEM TO HERE
Line_3358	THE BIG GOWNE
Line_3359	IF THE SWELL CAN CUCK ON IT SO

Line_3366	UP FINE
Line_3367	ABOUT THE HUMAN RERATORY SISTOM AND WHAT WE USE TO FOR WET FOR US TO BREATH
Line_3368	IT IS A WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOM AND THE SILOM
Line_3369	IT CH SHE
Line_3370	THE SMALL SCAXS DAM THE BOMILELEST AND THE OH WELL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN WHAT HAPENS AND E
Line_3371	UH WE'VE BEEN UM
Line_3372	THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE ERIN EGOCISTOM
Line_3373	UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE ER IT'S ON THE COM
Line_3374	BECAUSE THE WELS AND THE AXL ARE BOTH PART OF THE SISTOM TO MAKE THE CO WROL
Line_3375	A TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS IN THE CAR
Line_3377	I SEE UM THE AXLS AND THE WELES WHICH HELP THE ARM
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBIUMS AND THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE MAINS THE LUNGS AND THE HART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNGEROED SUM
Line_3381	IT HAS THE ER IT HAS THE WHOLE BUNCH CISTUMS LITTLE SUB ISTUMS
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE UBCISTOMS IN IT TO HELP THE ERTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNT TREES HOUSES AND AN OTION
Line_3384	THEY'RE PART OF NATURE AND HUMANS
Line_3385	I THINK THE BYBL SPEER IS MADE OF OF THE ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND THREESE AND NO HOUSES AROUND
Line_3386	I SEE THAT ALL THE EL CISTOMS AND THE ERTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BUL FOR FOREST THE WIGHT LANDS AND THE DESERT
Line_3387	THINK THERE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP RE HOLE KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3388	BYBLE PER IS MADE OF OF SAND AND LIVING CREACHURES
Line_3389	S ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND WHAT THEY CIL
Line_3390	THE FOOD MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF EOCISTUM THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT IN
Line_3391	
Line_3392	A
Line_3393	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3394	WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
Line_3395	WE HAVE BEEN BEEN LEARNING THE

Line_3397	IT GETS NOSING FROM THE SUN
Line_3398	BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON SIDE THAT GOES INTO THE AS A CRANE L
Line_3399	GETTING ALL THE FOOL FROM THE THING THAT EATCH THE PLANT TO GET THE SUNS ENERGY AND WHAT NO

Line_3402	I DON'T THE
Line_3403	SUMERRR THE CONSUMERS EAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_3404	THE DER EATS THE RAT AND THE RAT EATS THE GRASS

Line_3422	IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF WARMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
Line_3423	HELP THE PLANTS OND THE GROWND LIKE THE ROUT
Line_3424	A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS UM
Line_3425	THE LIVING CELLS AND OTHER PLAN
Line_3426	WHEN I CLIPPED AT MY LEG I NOTICE A WHO BUNCH OF LITTLE BUBS INSIDE A
Line_3427	MUSSLE ALLS ARE THE MOST PART OF THE BODDY SO THAT YOU CAN RUN THE WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
Line_3428	THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THE
Line_3429	I SEE THAT THE BRAIN IS NROMS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE THE PERSON SMALL
Line_3430	THE BRAIN SAYS WHAT THE RUN IS COMING OUT OF THEM
Line_3431	THAT THEY HAVE A LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF ONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NO AND NO ANNUMION COMES OUT
Line_3432	I SEE SOME SOURT OF DISSIN BUT I CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS
Line_3433	IMPORTANT OF THESE KIND OF SKIN CELLS IS HOW WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HELP HARKED
Line_3434	THAT THEY HELP PULLED THE SIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
Line_3435	THEY ARE MADE OF THAT FLASH IS THAT THE S CELL IS CONNECT TO
Line_3436	UH YES BECAUSE UM THE ANIMAL A MAGNET MAMBLYS UH HAVE THE SAM SKIN SELL
Line_3437	I NOTICE A BUNCH OF LITTLE SELLS AND THE E AND AND THE SKIN CELLS
Line_3438	M I THINK THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PART OF SELVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS HAD
Line_3439	I SEE SOME SORT OF WEARED LITTLE CELL AND THE UH PAINT CELL THAT'S DIFFER DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
Line_3440	THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW MEAN THAT DIFFERENT TYPES A SELLS EACH ANIMLE HAD
Line_3441	WHAT IT TELLS MEY ABOUT ERMANSAM SELLS IS UM ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
Line_3442	THERE IS A BLINK SCREEN INFRUNT OF ME
Line_3443	ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS DJESTIC ISTMONTHEHUME

Line_3446	TIGERS LEADS THE FODS TO UNDER THE STUMICK
Line_3447	THE LIQUID ACID
Line_3448	THEY THE BIGGEST PART OF THE DIJESTIE SISTAM
Line_3449	THE ALLOWED IN STINTS FOR THE WEST I AND THE SMALL INTESTINES FOR THE FLOWD TO GO DOWN
Line_3450	WELL THAT IT'S JUST FOOD IT SHALL GO INTO A BLUB SCREEN
Line_3451	ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND A ALL OF THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3452	THESE ARE UM TH ELL
Line_3453	IF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL SELLS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_3454	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING CELL INSIDE OF IT
Line_3455	UM THEY HERE MAKE BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEIVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR SHELLS IND SIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINEY PALM MY AND AN NOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIES
Line_3459	UH THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND ON THEM LIKE THE PALM MET HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
Line_3460	UM THEIR PATTERONS ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIZE OF THE LEAFF
Line_3461	HOW SOME ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS

Line_3469	ONE TWO GOES UP THE OTHER TWO GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LEANS
Line_3471	WHAT DOES WHAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE-BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_3473	TOD
Line_3474	IT'S ALL THE PLANTS AR RING OUR SUN
Line_3475	BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING THE THE SUN IN THE SOLAR FLAB
Line_3476	SOL DRAW LIKE
Line_3477	FOR STEEL PRENCE AND ALSO THE INER POINT
Line_3478	THE INNER PONENTS ARE SUPER SMALL
Line_3479	WHE ARE ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVETY WE WOULD SHUT IT
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SICSTMS
Line_3481	ERTH LUGIDGE COMPUTORS CARES THE HUMAN BODDY AND THE UNEVERSE
Line_3482	IT IT SAS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS AND A DON'T
Line_3483	HA SISTM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SISTOM
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOE
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THE INVOLVING THE SISTAOME
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY I LIGHT
Line_3487	CAUSE IT IS ON ERTH IT IS THE ERTH AND THAT IS AI
Line_3488	WE INTERACTING PARTS AND IN IT
Line_3489	I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS IN VOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN OTON HOUSES MOUTNS CLOUDS AND TREESE
Line_3492	THERE ARE EGO CISCIUMS AND I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMLE
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFFERC IT BROT UP THE T
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPROENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND ISE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	S MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THAT
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THAT
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY'RE TO A D COMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SISTOMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS ORE A BACK MATERIAL
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE
Line_3502	CHURES CONSUMERS AND D COMPOSEORS
Line_3503	A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATH AND EAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHES IN SE T WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATH OUT AND THEY BREATH OUT AIR WHICH IS WHAT REBRETI
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR ON SOD
Line_3506	CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASCING
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINCOPE
Line_3509	IT IS A FOG CHAIN OF MANY DIFFERENT THIN
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SON OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS ONE OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	THEY ARBEFORE ONLY EATS PLANMS
Line_3512	THINK THAT AN OMINEMORE MEANS THAT YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND THE ANIMLES
Line_3513	I THINK A D COMPOSOR IS U
Line_3514	DED PLANTS AND ANIMAL
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER UM THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE ERTH THAT HELPS IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS A A COMPOSER
Line_3517	A CARNOVOI
Line_3518	IT IS A HER ER
Line_3519	IT'S A D COMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE ERTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THE DED WEAIVES AND THE NUSE PAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOSED
Line_3521	FORMS UM D COMPOSIT AND MAKE IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THITUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF A BIG UM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FROUODODA S
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SORVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BUG THE BERD THE HOCK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3531	A D COMPOSER IT'S DED PLANTS AND AN
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DED PLANTS AND ANIMLES
Line_3533	THERE WILL GO THE MUSHROMES
Line_3534	YEAH A CONSUMER
Line_3535	A COMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT UM
Line_3537	BEING AND ERIOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NO PLAN A
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVOR BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NETHER A HEERBFOR OR A OR OR OR A OMTHE
Line_3541	BACTERIAL IS A D COMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOUSE IS A ERB
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOCX IS A CURON OF WA
Line_3544	THEY ARE WARENTED THEY ARE DCOMPOSORS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDONS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	THE RED FORM IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDONS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ITUMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMLE CRACKER IS NOT UM I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY SO YOU TELL MY
Line_3550	ES IS A FONGIS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN IT'S DOORMENT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SOME LIGHT WATER AND SWAIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PIXTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TWO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIVE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SUN AND THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SORVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NU TRANS TO SORVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SERVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SODBY FOTO CIMFICIS
Line_3561	TWO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WELL
Line_3562	PLANTS NEED SUN SERVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WILT
Line_3563	THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO DO
Line_3564	THE PLANT GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIVE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEAD EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SERVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIVE AND WILT
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WERENT THERE THEN SOME ANIMLES WOULD HAVE NOFTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM AND THE DIJESCTIVE M
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SITTING THE B IS CONLECTING TALL AND AND THE THE ES ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING TALL AND AND IT IS BRINGING THE POLE AND BACK TO THE COME
Line_3572	IT SHOES THAT ONE B ONS OTHER BES TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEAD MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DORBLE RANG THE DOLG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT THE MASS IT'S MASTER
Line_3575	IT SLAPS THE MASKETO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE D THE DOORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULAS IS THAT THE DOG BARTS
Line_3577	THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINEL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND
Line_3579	THE NERVES CSISCTM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHIN
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMELES AND THEY ALL HAVE DIJESTIVE THEM
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN AB ABATACHIR
Line_3583	THE SCUNK IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DIFFENDIT SELF FROM PRADUCTOR
Line_3585	IT'S ADDAT ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHELL BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SORVIVE FROM PRODUCT
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMLS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS IT'S POWDEREN ON IT'S BACK AND ON IT'S BODDY SO THAT IT CAN BE CARALLLASED IN WITH THE S P E
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEED FEET
Line_3589	NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS SO CAN FLIERE
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE OVER AWAY
Line_3592	THE STICK HAS AN ABJATATION ABOUT IT'S RATTL AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTLE IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTLE SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS IT'S TIME
Line_3594	IT IS INVOLVING A SCUNK WHITCH IS FOUDH FOR THE WOLF
Line_3595	AN ADDAPTACHION THAT THE SCUNK AS IS THE SMELL THAT MAKES THE SCUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SMELL
Line_3596	UM UM WHAT DOES CLASSIFIYE ME
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BERDS ARE FLYING IN THE RONE AND THE FRUNT IS THE LITER
Line_3598	IT'S BEHAVIOUR IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CACHING THE DISC
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY NOW HOW TO CATCH THE FRY WHEN THE
Line_3600	NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
Line_3601	IT IS I NOND WAREND BEHAVIOUR
Line_3602	THAT IS A WARNED BEHAVIER
Line_3603	THIS IS THEY NOT AREN'T BEHAVIR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT EMEADIEATLY WHEN THEY'RE BORN
Line_3604	THEY CATCH THE OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE SPELLS ARE DIFFERENT THEN UM THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY UM CELLS IN SIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINK
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUE
Line_3609	THEY ARE THE BIG BUBLBS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3610	MANY BLUE SCALLS THAT LOOK LIKE SIN
Line_3611	SINSALS HELP YOUR BODY RE HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN EAST DOUS
Line_3613	THE BUTTER FLY HAS CELLS IN ITS BODY AND THEN IT SWINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY SIJUESTIVE SISTOM AND THE HUMAN DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE OUR DIJUESTIITUM
Line_3616	IT'S SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTIANTES AND THE LUG
Line_3617	THE JDIJUCTITUM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET BAKER OUT OUR BODY
Line_3618	IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
Line_3619	THAT IS WHEIRE YOU WHERE THE FOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTINE
Line_3620	THEY TRAVEL THE FOD TO HELP IT GET OUT
Line_3621	IT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3622	THIS IS TOLLING YOU HUM PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THE
Line_3623	THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING INTO YOUR BODY AND GOING INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN COMING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREATH
Line_3624	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATH TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH
Line_3625	THEIR COMES IN TO THE BODY SO SO BUR NOWSE AND YOUR MOUTH
Line_3626	THERE ARE TOBS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRINKYEAH AND GO DEEP INTO THE LONGER
Line_3627	E BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS ON
Line_3628	AIR GETS STAKE IT INTO THE BODY BY WHEN YOU INHAIL IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
Line_3629	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3630	GOOD HOW GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3631	IT IS THE CIRCUITLS HETORIEA SISTOME
Line_3632	THE DOG CIRCULATORY SISTOM AND THE HUMAN CIRCULATORY SISTOM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAM
Line_3633	THAT IS OUR HART AND SOME OF OUR BLUD IS GOING INTO OUR HART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
Line_3634	I SEE O TWO EACH TWO WL COMING GOING OUT OF THE
Line_3635	THE BLUE IS THE SELLS AND THE RED PART OF THE BLUD IS GOING THROUGH IS THE CALL
Line_3636	THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART OF THE BLUD IS CAVELLARE
Line_3637	I THINK THAT THE HART PUMPS BLUD UM THROUGH OUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
Line_3638	BLUD GOES THROUGH BLUDD VESSLES AND GOES INTO THE HART AND IT GOES OUT OF THE HART
Line_3639	I THINK THAT BLUDD GOES INTO THE HART SOME BLUD GOES INTO THE HART AND SOME BLUD COMES OUT OF THE
Line_3640	IF THE BLUD VESSLES
Line_3641	SEE IS THE BLUD AND IT IS THE BLUDY STREEM WERE THE BLUD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
Line_3642	THE RESPATORIA CISTOM IS HOW YOU BREATH
Line_3643	THAT IS ABOUT THE AIR GOING INTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
Line_3644	AIR COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THEN NOW
Line_3645	IT IS ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3646	RONGS AND YES IT IS IN THE RESTORYSTUF
Line_3647	THE DIEFAM THE DIE FRAM
Line_3648	WELL ACTUALLY I'VE OLREDY PASSED IT
Line_3649	THEY ALL HAVE INIRACTING PARCS
Line_3650	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3651	IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT AND IT MOVES WITH THE WHOLE PART
Line_3652	IT'S YOUR BODDY YOUR BODDY IS A VERY BIG CISTA WITH SMALLER IT IN SIDE OF IT
Line_3653	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAROMOE
Line_3654	THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3655	WE HAVE INDIRACTING PARTS AND SMALLER SISTOMS INSTEAD OF OUR BODY
Line_3656	A SMALLER SISTUM SO SISTMS
Line_3657	AS ILANDS OTIONS AND LEAVING THINGS AS BY THE SFERE ATMES FERE AND OTHER SMALLER SUB SISTOMS
Line_3658	THE IT HAS TO BY HE SFER A
Line_3659	L WAIT ONE I THINK
Line_3660	LIVING THINGS
Line_3661	IT HAS CREATCURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
Line_3662	THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
Line_3663	GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
Line_3664	FOD WAS
Line_3665	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR ON FOOD COMSUMARS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN D COMPOSED US D COMPOSED THE P I CSUMETERYS
Line_3666	BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOD
Line_3667	THE GRASS AND THE PIN CONE
Line_3668	BY EATING EACH OTHER OR OR THE PRODUCERS
Line_3669	THE HAIR SMAKE THE HOCK THE BERD THE BEL AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3670	WHEN THE CONSUMAR DIE THEY D COMPOSE THEIR BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF TURNS
Line_3671	THE DEAD BODIES AND TREES AND STUFF OF DID ANIMALS AND THREE PLANTS
Line_3672	THE BACK TERIA AND THE MUSHRUMS ARE I
Line_3673	A BARY OR A EITHER PLAN
Line_3674	FUN DI AR AND MUCHEREOUMS
Line_3675	MUCH RUM OR FUN DIVE
Line_3676	I DON'T KNOW W
Line_3677	CONSUMERE OR HUMAN
Line_3678	CUMNEORS AND UMNEORES AND HURBEORCE
Line_3679	EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAN
Line_3680	THEY E PLANS IT ONLY PLANS
Line_3681	HERBS EATCH ONLY AND
Line_3682	YOU HURBL OR
Line_3683	TO UM ONLY PLANS THE E BOTH PLANTS AND ME WEIGHT W
Line_3684	UM NOMORE
Line_3685	AND UHM METLABLEAR
Line_3686	T E ONLY DED THING
Line_3687	LIKE LIKE ONLY D THE COMPOSED STUFF OR DED STUFF
Line_3688	A COM IN OF WOR
Line_3689	IT'S A D COMPOSER THEY WERE THEY ONLY DID STUFF
Line_3690	A D COMPOSER
Line_3691	THEY PRODUCE HELTHY STUFF OR PLAINS OR THAT ERTH WORKS M
Line_3692	MORE FOOD CHAINES AND FOBWOODS BUT WE ALSO STUDIED UM UM THERE'S CINEORS AND HERBS
Line_3693	A MS AND LE CRACKERS CH HAVES SHOGER AND FLOWER AND WASHER
Line_3694	I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM E AND GETTING IT'S NEREAMS
Line_3695	THEY WEEARE MUCH SO
Line_3696	WELL THE UM PLAIN ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
Line_3697	THE PUT ALSO NEEDS SUNLLY
Line_3698	OH I DON'T KNEED HAMBIGARS BUT THEY NEED FOD BUT THEY PRODUCE ARE LIKE FOOD BY USING SHOGAR SONLIGHT AND WATER PAPER
Line_3699	IT BOTH FOOD BUT I DON'T NEAND REALLY MURE HOW BECAUSE IT PRODUCES IT'S OWN
Line_3700	IT LOOKS LIKE SLES
Line_3701	WE HAVE EASE EXPERIMENTS
Line_3702	IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
Line_3703	LOOKS LIKE A FACTERY
Line_3704	I DO NOT KNOW I FORGOT
Line_3705	THEY'RE RAY COLD THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS OF THE BUSSL AND THERE IS ALL DOTS BETWEEN
Line_3706	THEY LOOK LIKE NARVES
Line_3707	UM NORMALE SELLS LOUD SELLS
Line_3708	CLIP BY SCAN
Line_3709	THEY'RE MADE OF CELL EVERYTHING S MADE T LS EVERLIFTING THINGS MADE OF
Line_3710	WE HAVE A LOT MORE SELLS THAN EST
Line_3711	HUMAN BECAUSE FOR NOT JUST ONE SOL ORGANIS ORGANISOM IS LIKE E
Line_3712	THE BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT THE S
Line_3713	I FORGOT MMM I THINK ABOUT THE YEAH I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_3714	THE DIJESTIVE SIS ST
Line_3715	WE BOTH HAVE DIJESTIVE SISTOMS
Line_3716	OUR DIJESTIVE SITOM
Line_3717	BRAKING DOWN FOD AND GIVING OUR BODDIES ENERGY
Line_3718	THE MOUNT BRAKS DOWN THE FOD
Line_3719	THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMIXK IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE ST MIX
Line_3720	IT BRINGS F INTO THE STUMIC USING MUSSLES
Line_3721	IT BREAKS DOWN FOD
Line_3722	TO BREAK DOWN FOOD AND YEAH
Line_3723	THE INTESTINEXURABL THE NU TRANTS AND WASHER FOR IT TO USE FOR A BODY
Line_3724	IT GIVES OUT WAIST SWITCH IS DI STAN
Line_3725	IRE LEARNING ABOUT THEE AND PLANS
Line_3726	IT'S TALL MIGHE
Line_3727	IT'S A PLLEAR MER SOMETHING AG THAT NOT TO THE PE I THINK
Line_3728	GETTING FOD FROM PLACE PLACE MAKING FOD
Line_3729	FEDS THE PLANT OF STUFF
Line_3730	THERE'S A BAGE ROUND THE LEE AND THAT S S WATER VAPER COMING OFF FROM THE LEEWHICH IS VERY USFLL
Line_3731	UM I FORGOT
Line_3732	A HEN WHICH HELPS OUR BODY WHEN THAT HELPS MAKES OUR BODY LID
Line_3733	THEY BOTH HAVE PARTS AND VAIMS
Line_3734	THE CICULATORY SISTUM
Line_3735	THAT THE HART ONE SIDE OF THE HART PUMS ALL THE WEIY THROUGH THE BODDY THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMS TO THE BACK
Line_3736	MOCIGON FOOD WITH NUIRANS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER W
Line_3737	BLUME OR SELES
Line_3738	UH THE SAME THING
Line_3739	UM IT'S FARNICH LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
Line_3740	BLUD VESSLES THE HART AND BLUD
Line_3741	BLUDD'S GOING IN AND OUT
Line_3742	THERE WON'T ONE THE THE VAINS DILIVERY CSISTOM THE PHARTS DILIVERY SISTOM THEN THE VANS ARE THE RODS
Line_3743	IF FLOW TO THE PART TAKE IT AWAY
Line_3744	PRONACE THE HIWAYST FOR BLOOD AND THEY ARE CALLED MAINS AND ARTERY
Line_3745	THE PUMP
Line_3746	SEE UM THES WILL HOLDS THE BLUD
Line_3747	IT'S THE IT'S THE LONG A PRILITCH MEAN THAT IT'S A RESPRATORY SISTOM AND YEAH
Line_3748	IN THE PARTS OF THE RESPATORY SISTOM
Line_3749	THERECSPITORYS NUM IS RESPONSIBLE RETING OR INER BODY AND CARBON CID OUT
Line_3750	THEY ARE GOING IN AND OUT THE LU AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OCIGION HER SELES AND GETTING CARBON SIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES IN AND FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE M
Line_3753	THERE TWO EBZACT CARY AIR AND BRANCH OFF TO THE TREE D GO DEEP INTO THE DIS AND THEY PERNETCHAL AIR SAC
Line_3754	CELLS A RING OFF CARBONS AND PICKING UP OCIGIN
Line_3755	UM IS
Line_3756	EACH THE AIR SAX OR A BOLT I
Line_3757	CHE THE UM
Line_3758	THE CIRCULAR TORYIS
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE FULL SISTOM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRY LE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BI FIRE THEY ARE L WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BI FIRE MAKING IT UN ENTIRE SISTOM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SICTUMS AND MOLECULES AND D STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SARY I'M ON THE RONG UM IT WEP SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SHOURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE ES OR ESED PARTICALES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HOT ME WITH THAT UM NOT TO HERE
Line_3768	MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUIGHT AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT UM PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SERVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOD AND WATER TO SERVIVE
Line_3770	SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF FERNALLISER
Line_3771	DEFINEATLY DEFFAINATLY DEFFNEANTLY DATA NOT A REALLY
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANTS ALSO NEAD AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE FOTO CIMFICIS TO GET THE T FROM I MEAN TO START OVER S
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS E OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SO
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY CELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG CELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE UM EST IS MADE UP OF ONE SLOW THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIONS OF SOUTH
Line_3779	IT'S A BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN INTIRE SISTOM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DI JUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	SELLS AND ORGANISMS AND SISTUMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SELLS AND ONE SISTM
Line_3784	PINK MUSLES IN THE LEG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSSLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSSL CELL
Line_3786	THOSE ARE THE BRAIN CELLS AND THE BRAIN ORGANISED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AND THE EST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE SIDE
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLYS NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BONCH OF SELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SISTUMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISUM S AND SISTUM S IN SIDE OF ARE BODIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOED THROUGH IT IT ALL THE WEIY THROUGH YOUR BODDY IN THE FRONT IN THE TOP FRUNT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOD DOWN INTO THE STUMICK SO THAT YOU CAN DIJEST THE FOD
Line_3793	TO DIJEST THE FOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FODES ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M RELY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SAND ME HAVE TO DE BUT HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NO OR WET WET NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DID BREATH WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIVE
Line_3797	I THINK IT H THE DIAGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE OVIEULLYAUND YEAH THE ALVIOLYEACH
Line_3799	OT MISS LIKE HOW ARE YEOU
Line_3800	I THINK IT'S IN THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS SEE TWO AND O TWO
Line_3802	Y END B THE MOUTH AND THE NOES
Line_3803	IT
Line_3804	I'M NOT TOTALLY SHURE CAN YOU HELP MEY WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE AC TWO ERLLIER
Line_3806	UM SISTUMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I THINK THAT IS A WHART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HART AND THE VAINS CONNECT INTO THE HART
Line_3809	EACH TWO OW AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLUD CELLS ARE TRAVELLING THROUGH ARE THE VAINS AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
Line_3811	THAT'S THE BLUE PART IS CELL OUR SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAPILLARY
Line_3812	IT LETTING AN BLUD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLUD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLUD AROUND AND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIR BODDY
Line_3814	THE BLUD VESSLES THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLUD AROUND
Line_3815	THE PUMS SPLUD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	ELL IS THE CIRCULATORY SISTUM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS IN SIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASSIES SO THAT WE CAN SERVIVE
Line_3819	UM THE RUNS DEFFINEATLY THE LUMGS
Line_3820	THE LUMGS
Line_3821	THROUGH AN BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TFRHEA
Line_3823	THE RATTL SNAKES RATTL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAD HE HE GOT WERIED WHEN HE SAW THE SPILL OVER SO IT STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SOPRISE
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT USE THE QUIGHT FAT MAN
Line_3826	UM I'M NOT SHURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SICTMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTECES SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT IM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WED FEET
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HAS TEETH SO IT CAN RIP OPEN HIS PRAY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FOR AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF ES ALWAYSE FOLLOWS ONE GOT BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE MAIN BEHAVIOUR
Line_3833	UHM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WETHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOLG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT NOES WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW UP
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BERNED SO THEY HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURTS SO THEY JUST WANNO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THEY REALLY HURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL RE FLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THERE SPETSHIAL REFLEXIS
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LARNING ABOUT WETHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL IN ACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S HE SISTOM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO A IT IS IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT HAS ISTOMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AND IN ACTING OF MOVING POWDER TOGETHER MAKANG A CO
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POW MOVEMENT T WORK TOGETHER
Line_3843	IS BECAUSE IT HAS IN ACTING POWRS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SISTOM
Line_3844	THE HOUT AND THE IS
Line_3845	THE IS MOVING THE POUCH MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES IT
Line_3846	YEA HAS TO MOVE AND TO ALL WORK TOGETHER
Line_3847	I SEE IT'S A MOUNT ON LOOKING THINGE AND IT HAS FORCIS STUMBS
Line_3848	UM FOLLE
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PINTS AND BUT THEY HAVE NO PINTS AND AMINALS
Line_3850	ECO SISTOM LIKE IS CARES
Line_3851	THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR AMINALMS AND THE AMINA
Line_3852	BUT THE EMMINALS PROSSESS THOUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHER ERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ALL PRODUCING A S ISTIM OF THE OR
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE SUM
Line_3855	IS A SISTM WITH ACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SISTAM
Line_3856	IT IS A BUNCH AND ACTUAL POST WORKS THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIKE ST
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE I NORMED ABOUT MOVING THE
Line_3858	IS IT HAS BUNCH OF SUP SISTOMS WE NEAT MAKE ONE
Line_3859	I THINK THAT THESE ARE SOPTUMS
Line_3860	STICICUM BECAUSE IT'S ING AND DON'T ACT M POD MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT WANTS A DIE THE IS
Line_3862	GOOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS UM
Line_3866	IT'S BODY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBITUM
Line_3868	A HARE AKIN NEY AND E
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S UM A BIGGER PART OF SOM SUB IT
Line_3870	THEY ARE OR
Line_3871	O FER IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN EGO CSISTOM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S UM LAND AND OH
Line_3874	THE AROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE LIKE OR WHAT AND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TWO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS THAN THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS TENED THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I THINK THAT WARM PLACES WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPPORATED OFF THE CIRCUISS
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE CIRCUICS CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO SHRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DISCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRCUISS AREA FACTS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATEES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE CIRCUIS IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SOPRISED ME QUIGHT YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PETALS EVAPORATE QUIGHT A LOT MORE AND THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SOIL AND THE ROCK OR GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER AND THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GASSSTICKD
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP I WATER DROP LITS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BUM CUP IS COLDER THAN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN SEROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITTING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER WELL TO HELP US LIFT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	MARNEY YOU'RE AREDY ASCK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	ATSEL CAME ORNEY
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING WHAISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT ER OR LITER THIS ER
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICIME MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WAR AND IT WAS PRTYCLL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST ALLOW EASIER TO YUTH
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BOCKUITS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE STAIL AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_3907	THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH AND THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SAIL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGARING OUT HOW HEAVY IT TO MIK SHURE THEY ARE CRACTD
Line_3911	WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORTED A GUESSED
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WELL BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST WANT US TO BE GOOD ESTIMETERS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE IT WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORCE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORCKE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROW HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE METRIC CISTOM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT A MIX SURE IT RIGHT
Line_3922	YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHINGS BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND COUNTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR HE WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTH WIZE ITS GOING TO GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SHURE IT SOMETIMES YOU'RE NEXT THINK ABOUT IT UH I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE STEAL YEAH THE STEAL YEAH
Line_3927	NO I DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE CAN'T HOW MANY BE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WAIST THE PLASTER CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	UH NETBLE A METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	MMM NO NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	THIS UM OH SAREY
Line_3933	NO WOULD BE FIVE PETES
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLA STICK WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	UH SARY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIDE
Line_3939	ONE GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I I I WAS MOST SOPRIZED THAT I I PICK RED OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHIY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY BANK AND YOU WOULD'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME FLY PAPER CLIP
Line_3943	TEN
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DETH WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
Line_3946	UM FOBSICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRITY USFUL BUT THEY CAN BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING US
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NO
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T KILARMANY YET NO
Line_3952	UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER DON'T YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HA
Line_3953	UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO I DON'T WEIGHT
Line_3955	UH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T ONLY NUMBER US USING THIS CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH
Line_3958	AH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAT TAKE THESE OFF OK
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLAR HIM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH I JUST THIRTY EIGHT PIECES ONE I WALKED YEAH
Line_3962	YEAH IT WON'T IT BETTER I WON'T HAVE AND OUR LITTLE LI D NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO I DON'T REALLY KNOW MMM
Line_3965	TWENTY LIMITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW MAYBE JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAD UH WE SHOULD DISCRIVE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO AT THE OFF SO EH
Line_3967	T YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBE BECAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE
Line_3969	AVENOGRASAING THAT IT'S MOST YEAH
Line_3970	THE I NO THE ANSWER TO S
Line_3971	IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWISE
Line_3972	UM YEAS WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY GOT A LOT BETTER
Line_3973	UM IS LEARN THAT
Line_3974	YEAH REPEATING THING IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONES AND I FOR HAT ME SHOW AS ALWAISE MISS OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE A GREAYS UM
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS A OTHER R FOUR E
Line_3977	GRAMS ABOUT AS MUCH AS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	AN BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO ELAGRAMS AND HE THOU IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A A GRAM IS JUST ABOUT AS WHEN TO LUSER PAPER CLIP
Line_3980	YES TO WAS AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	MMM YEAH THOUSAND
Line_3982	A MILAGRAM IS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGHS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	UM EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BEE ONE LINE
Line_3984	M THE IKE LESS AND THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM USE THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRAT IT WOULDN'T BE SO IT SLANTED
Line_3986	M CA BUT I WANT TO SEE THEM TO REACT TO TIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHT MORE
Line_3988	WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM S ACTUALLY PARTY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED BEAN SE QUMS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE NET OR THE BEEMS EQUALS A GRAM
Line_3992	YEAH THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WAS TENUGFF
Line_3994	A HUNDRED GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM SEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP UM ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TWO SMAE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT JUST THE INDIRACTIVE TIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSIS
Line_4000	AND WE DID WA WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	THAT THING IS GOING UH THE CLIPS AND GOES UP
Line_4002	READING RIGHTING A MASS MANLY
Line_4003	H SLICHEIS READ
Line_4004	MMM WELL YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DISC WITH THE SCRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING ON MINEBIT
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE DISCS WITH THREE BY TWO NINE WAS TWENTY NINE TENTH AH TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DI SI FORTY AND ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSED TWO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NINE TEN I MEAN TWO OR NINE TENSERS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE PINT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	M UH PA
Line_4011	NO WELL YEAH WE DID WE GOT TER SAY MA
Line_4012	UM A METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR NAMES THEY ARE
Line_4013	NO IT DOESN'T COLOR IT AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THO I I I'VE NO IDEA OR YOU MIGHT COLOR IT SOME TIME
Line_4015	THOSE THING WAS MARKS CENTIMETERS OKAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER AND IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER WALL WAY IS DON'T
Line_4017	NO WE JUST WE JUST STARTED CUING IT OUT AND BLUE IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	O ONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALS ONE TEN CENT TO BE
Line_4019	THAT'S THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTIMETERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR SIX TEN AND TEN IN THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHAT DOES SALONE MILLIMETER
Line_4022	H CAN
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS THE I DON'T WANT TO GET RED OF T
Line_4024	OKAY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT
Line_4025	I NO BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FOR I S
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGER OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LMETERS NOW CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPAR VILES M YEAH UH THAT'S LIKE WHAT ARMS WERE
Line_4029	UM I L I LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUALED TO ONE LITER I NO
Line_4030	M NOT I I NO LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT'S IT WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I YOU CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	MEBEAH L THIS SITS THING IS A KILLITER I THINK
Line_4032	LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	AN AH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UM YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GRUM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLLITER TRAVEL EQUALS A MILLLY A MILLMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD SINE THE CUPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEN AND YOU WOULD POUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	WELL WE I WANNA TO GRASURATES YEAH
Line_4040	YEAH YOU COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS SOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	I THINK THIS IS ON BACK CURENTS THAT'S WAY SOMETHING
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DON IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YEAT THE TE C HAS ONLY SO IN US WE USED THE FI AL THING AND THEN THE T C HAS ALSO SHOEDUS BUT
Line_4046	CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE AND THE UM S THE THING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF FILLS AND SOME PIEPELE SINCE A A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LETER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE VOLIUM OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WIT OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	MMM WE YOU SA I AM PINK TS NEAREST STING YOU BY THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLIUM IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT TO THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT THE IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPS AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH HEIGHT WITH DEPS AND LENGTH
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE HEARY E NO NOT THE ONE WA DID WE DO THIS WORK
Line_4056	M'S A HUNDRED THERE'S A THOUSAND OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S A TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOL OF IT
Line_4057	WIGH S AND W O TEN
Line_4058	THE UM PROPABLY THE S THE THIS ONE HAS THE OWLS
Line_4059	I UH MEAN THE PROBALY TA HUNDREDS
Line_4060	M WHAT'S U IN YEAH MMM YEAH UM LIKE IS ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	M E MOTO LI WHAT WHAT APERCHING WHAT WE'RE STINKING WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABS
Line_4062	UM TROP RABBELY MILLLITERS
Line_4063	BUT I WANT TO SEE THE FIRST I ONE I DON'T FORGET THE U
Line_4064	WE WERE USING VILES WE USED VILES A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH WELL NO WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
Line_4066	M NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LI A B LI A S LAND A D LINE
Line_4067	THE SREN IS A THING THAT SO IT SUCKS UFF WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THEY ARE THE YOU S STUCKED UP
Line_4068	WELL BY THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH IT'S NO
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS THE LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BE FOR WINTER BREAK
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VILES WERE DIFFERENT YEAH MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADOUATED SO AND THERE IS IT THOSE ONES HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER
Line_4074	UM HOW MANY OH THERE'S A SOUSPEND IN THAT BIG THING AND THEN ONE LITER
Line_4075	L IT'S THE SO CAND THE INTERACTI SODA CAN I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES OH
Line_4076	NO BUT WELL A HUNDRED NOATY THAT LOOKS NEE IT LS
Line_4077	TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADURATED SILMETERS EQULE WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT DOES IT COLD IS WHAT IT'S ONDERING O IT TRAY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONE'S WIZED IF YOU FLATDAN THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL AND THE ELSE TOWN STANDS FOUR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER AND TENT IT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_4082	WE WHAT YOU DO AS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER IS LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LINED UP TO ITS ERE
Line_4083	W WEN GEE
Line_4084	UM UM NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND THAT'S SAIL MAN TO REACT TO THE SIN IT I ONES
Line_4086	SLANT TRACT WATER
Line_4087	IT'S INTERACTIVE OR AN SODA H WELLEXSLY IT'S ON SODA
Line_4088	BUT I WANT A VIA TAKE MY CONSALS
Line_4089	M L UM NO FOWHERAND
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WHEN NOT WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
Line_4091	E YEAH
Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UFF AND SAD TO A CARPUNDER
Line_4093	UH I WA I MEAN IF YOU CAME ON TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED OUT A GRAPH STOR INSIDE YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4095	OF APPLES PROBLY YOU PROBABLY WOULDE A USE SMALL AN TA HOU COULD USE BIG
Line_4096	POUWNS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	M SO IT SAY W ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTING ONE POUND SOME THINGS
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED AT THE UM UNED ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UM
Line_4100	AND PLASTRIC TIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	ARE ARE GOOD TO USE SHURE MEASURE I MEAN WEIGHT
Line_4102	IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE SHE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STROS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	M ONE WOULD BE SMALLER AND ONE WOULD BE HUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND RU WOULD BE S
Line_4107	WITH THE ROL ER ER TAPE MEASURE
Line_4108	WIL MOSTRELL MOSTRVILLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAY LINGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A RILAR WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURE BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULDN'T USE MET METERS
Line_4112	I NOWICE A HUNDRED A HUNDRED OF A CENTIMETER
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS SURE AND A METER
Line_4114	MY DADD MEASURES WIT UM BILLS BILDING SO HE USES HOW LOT OF IS STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A A KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE ERL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO HOW YOU PUT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE TIME
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD UM MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETER IS LONG
Line_4121	UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURE IT MEASURES WHAT IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE GUESS MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPETERS DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOORS AR UM CAN BE
Line_4126	WIDER THAN TABE THAN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UM ROMERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAYGHED UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WOUBBLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE THE CORRECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERS SO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS I CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	HICOD
Line_4135	YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN U MILLIMETERS AND A CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T I MEAN NO
Line_4138	NO MARALLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPUNGHES SPUNGHES THEY SILK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEEN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS ARE MEASURING TOOLS
Line_4141	IN THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURED OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNTIL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVEL
Line_4143	SO SAME WA I PUT THE DRY SPUNGE AND IT'S LIKE THIS AND OTHER GRAM TEN A ANOTHER GAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM AND NO IT'S PRITY BALANCE RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU YOU PICK OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND C IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SOBTRACT FROM THE WEIGHT SPUNGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPUNGE YOU WEIGHT UNTIEL IT'S FULL AND YOU NOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MECY UM FOR ME
Line_4147	UM HOW MUCH WATER IS AND THAT A DRY SPUNGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS AND ONE BY ONE AGEN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TWO IF IT'S LIKE AND HEAVY IM YOU CAN GO BY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU TAKE UP FIVE AND THEN A OTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TWO HEAVIER ON YOU PUT IN THE OTHER FIVE YOULD TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	THE DRY SPUNGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN REAMILLIAR A NUMBER
Line_4153	UM THEE
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHTS
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGH TWENTY FOR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	MMM IN THE IN THE DRY SPUNGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	M IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UN EVEANLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIGGE SPUNGE SHOULD HUN MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY NO
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PIXTURE OF IT
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG AND SO IT'S GOING O BE TICK
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO IDEA REAL YOU HAVE NO I DEA
Line_4166	THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN YOU WARNCH
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAYBE TO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH I MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4169	MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISSPOSAL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	A MILLEG I THINK THERE THESE THINGS CALLED MILLEGRAMS I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILEGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WE METER IT'S LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LANXS FRUM
Line_4175	TAXIS FROM HERE IT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS A MASING YEAH A
Line_4177	DRY SPUNGESLMA
Line_4178	AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESSING
Line_4179	NOT REALLY YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
Line_4180	HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WO
Line_4181	THE THING TESTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPOUNGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	MMM I CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WELL HMMM
Line_4185	LEVELE MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BAR IS LINED UP WITH THIS ST
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMTY WATER BAL OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	IF M I DON'T PUT AN OTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE IF AN ALLY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IND IT
Line_4190	IT THE THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED IN TO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER AND THIS FAN
Line_4192	UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCUITS
Line_4193	I THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	A KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBE THAT TOP COMPOTOR A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WEIGHT THAT OUNCIS SIXTY OUNCES IS A POWND
Line_4198	THEN BY DIFLUMY HOME HE SHE USED HAVE A JOB IN CALEFORNEA

Line_4247	UM THAT IS UM A KILOGRAM ACTUALLY THAT IS ABOUT A HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_4248	NO YEAH
Line_4249	UM YOU MA
Line_4250	GRADUATED CENTILITER AND SOMETHING THAT CUPS WATER IT'S CALLED A CRANE HAS CIRANCH WE USED IT SO
Line_4251	UM IT WAS ALL THE WEIGH TO A TOP AND R ME WAS ALL THE WEIGH TO THE TOP
Line_4252	UM YEAH WE WERE LOOKING FOR FOR UHM THE VILLIUM ASIGE TOLD YOU ABOUT UM WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING
Line_4253	YOUR CAPACITY THE CAPACITY IS WHEN UM I NOW A CAPACITY MA IT IS WHEN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY UP BUT
Line_4254	OH IS IT OREAH
Line_4255	WELL UM SODA CANS ARE FILLED ALL THE WEIGH TO THE TOP
Line_4256	CAPACITY NOVOLLIUM BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY FILLED TO THE TUFF
Line_4257	UM I REALLY KNOW WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT
Line_4258	NO
Line_4259	NO WE PUT UM IN THIS T OF CAN AND THEN WE MEASURED IT
Line_4260	THEN WE PULRED IT IN INTO THE INTO THE SODA CAN
Line_4261	AN UN SOCAM
Line_4262	MALLVATORS ARE THE TE
Line_4263	WELL A LITER IS BIGGER THAN A MILL METER WELL IT'S YOU NO LITER IS
Line_4264	E DN'T T WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT ONE
Line_4265	ILLITER IS UM TO A HUNDRED A HUNDRED ILILITERS
Line_4266	UM WE USED GRAMS
Line_4267	M LOOK TO I REALLY NO LIKE MMM
Line_4268	UM I DON'T THINK SO
Line_4269	UM YEAP
Line_4270	NO BECAUSE UM YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER YOU PUT IN THERE

Line_4275	NO YEAH EH
Line_4276	SODA LIKE MASS AND TURN
Line_4277	I DON'T YEAH
Line_4278	UM WE MEASURED EACH OTHER WITH METERS
Line_4279	WEAH AR HUH
Line_4280	IT Y IT STARTED WITH THE SMALLEST AND THEN COUN'T DO THE HIGHEST IT WORKS
Line_4281	THEN WE MEASURED THE RUM IN WITH THE MEDIUM SIZED PACE
Line_4282	YO ACTUALLY WOULD HAPND WE MEASURED FROM OUR UM ALS WAY TO THE OFFISS
Line_4283	I ONE IN THAT WE'RE A SORT OF EVERYBODY JUST SORT OF M BETWEEN ONE FIFTY AN TWO HUNDRED
Line_4284	I DON'T KNOW PACE UH I FORGOT WHAT I FROM ABOUT THAT
Line_4285	I DON'T KNOW WE ALL MEASURED WITH THE SAME MEADIUM SIZE PAST
Line_4286	NO BUT WE HAD TO PIECE OF PAPER WHICH WAS THE METIUM SPACE
Line_4287	AND LOOK AT MORE STUFF BUT ELSIES
Line_4288	WHAT DOES ESTIRATE A TWO IS
Line_4289	ONE LOKATE OR WHAT ELSE IS THEIR
Line_4290	I L I LIKE LOOKING AT THE MILLAMETERS
Line_4291	NO I WANNA DO THE MOREADVANSE I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METERS STICK I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCE METERS STICK
Line_4292	OH IT'S THREE METERS LONG BUT ACTUALLY ARM
Line_4293	M TEN CENTIME LIKES A METER HIGH CARIOUS ATE METER M AM NO
Line_4294	I DON'T BUT THIS BUT BUT MY ARM SPAN WAS WAS WAS ACTUALLY LONGER THAN HOW TALL I WAS AND IT WAS MORE THAN A METER
Line_4295	MMM NO NO NOT USUALLY SOME OF UM
Line_4296	IT'S I WANT TO LOOK AT THE GREGROP GROP STRAWS
Line_4297	THAT THE THE STRAWS ARE NOT GOOD
Line_4298	YEAH BUT DON'T WHAT NO GO IT TO MORE STUFF ON T I WANT THEM
Line_4299	PIECES THAT'S WHAT WE DID METER TAPE SO IT MOVES
Line_4300	I WANT TO SEE THE OTHER METERS STICK
Line_4301	METERS STICK METERS STICK ONE AND METERS STICK TWO WHAT'S METERS STICK
Line_4302	OKAY NO BUT I I WON'T LOOK AT UH THE ECIMETER STICK
Line_4303	H OKAY I L WE NOW THERE'S HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM
Line_4304	ONE CENTIMAIN I ALWAISE A MIXTURE
Line_4305	TEN THERE'S TEN DECIMETERS AND ONE
Line_4306	AT LEAST IS THEIRE ANY KILOMETERS
Line_4307	THE OTHERS OR LIKE CLICK ON SCAIL
Line_4308	MEASURING LONG DISTANCES LIKE THE SCHOWOELL TO THE HOUSE
Line_4309	MAYBE I WOULD USE A MILLERITER BECAUSE TREES
Line_4310	WE DID THAT WHEN I WANTED TO METER TALK BORING WE HASN'T DON THAT ONE YET
Line_4311	THREE SO IN HALF FOR M YES FOR METERS
Line_4312	YEAH NORANEVITER TAPE MADE ENSLS AGAIN
Line_4313	THAT YOU'RE TAPING BY TON SALTS TWENTE H F
Line_4314	NO NO WE DON'T DO THAT WE D WE ARE ALL RIGHT STRAWS ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_4315	UM ONE AIR MOVING INTO A NO HOUSE ALL THO I'VE NEVER DON THAT
Line_4316	DO LIKE FAR NMEAXTURE UMM
Line_4317	ALL RUST
Line_4318	MEASURE IS WALL OF YOUR FAMELY
Line_4319	SO WE'VE LEARNED THAT ON METER ISN'T HOW MUCH IS IT
Line_4320	THIS HOW IT'S A EM ON
Line_4321	THE YOU ELEARED ABOUT I AS IN

Line_4327	WE'RE DON'T FORGET MEERIER SALTS BECAUSE
Line_4328	NO SEN BECAUSE YOU ARE TALLER AND WEIGH
Line_4329	FHOLLY CENTIMETERS INCHES NO ONE'S A CENTIMETER OR A SMALL IS
Line_4330	UH YEAH WE'VE BOTH ARE THE SAME RESULTS YEAH
Line_4331	UM IT'S NOT A BETTER COUNT
Line_4332	UH WE LRIKE ALL SOME WERE NOT A
Line_4333	UH WHEN IT'S IT IS E IN OUR TO IT'S U
Line_4334	ARE WELL WE HAVE IN SO WERE IN SCIENCE WE HAVE TO AH A RED
Line_4335	L THEY DID THE SELVES E BIGGER SILIMETERS LE
Line_4336	BEAN I
Line_4337	WE HAVE A COLOR IT COULD FIT
Line_4338	THE A THEN YOU THINK IT OUT THAT THAT THEY HA UM WHEN YOU OPEN A SOLA TEN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WITH E
Line_4339	U MINE'S IF ALL THE WATER AND SALT IS ONCE
Line_4340	I NO IT'S R
Line_4341	MAN ES ER SO
Line_4342	IT'S LIGHT THE SIGHT SON'T THINK THAT STUFFS OF WATER SO I TEL
Line_4343	YEAH SO HOW YOU USE MOTOR THEY ARE AS I WA

Line_4352	I THIS ARE WE HAVE BEEN JU YEAH
Line_4353	IT HAS LIKE IT'S BIGGER A LITTERAT AND IT HAS LIKE A THING AND SIDE
Line_4354	BECAUSE UM D YOU SEE THIS UM IT'S LIKE IT GOES THIS WAY IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'S THAT ONE'S LIGHTER AND THAT ONE'S HEAVIER
Line_4355	M THIS ONES LOWER AND THIS ONES HIGHER
Line_4356	IT'S MORE HEAVIER THAN THE LIGHTER
Line_4357	WE HAD LITTLE BLOCKS AND WE LITTLE TINY BLOCKS AND WE COULD SEE HOW MANY BLOCKS DO WE TAKE
Line_4358	YOU LIKE ONE OF THOSE TAKE THEM
Line_4359	M THE LITTLE BOS NO YEAH THE LITTLE PALE

Line_4401	YEAH NOT WATER LIKE A LITTLE BIT SO SHYOU CAN SEE HOW HUH HOW DIFFERENT IT IS EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER
Line_4402	YEAH SOME WERE THE SAME AND SOME WERE NOT THE SAME
Line_4403	COAT
Line_4404	MEASURING WATER BOTTLES
Line_4405	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4406	M HIS HER TECH TO PUT LIKE UM WATER AND SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE TH
Line_4407	THEY WERE SBOISE AND MY GROUP ONLY BOISE AND THE UHM GIRLS I WAS JUST THE ONLY GIRL IN THAT GROUP ME

Line_4412	UM I MEAN HOW MUCH WATER DOES TAKE IN THE SODA PAM
Line_4413	THAT E HAD WATER UM SO WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
Line_4414	M HE WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RIGHT THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WHAT NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINK UP YEAH
Line_4417	UM MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CAMS AND HOW MUCH WATER COULD TAKE
Line_4418	UM LIKE
Line_4419	UHM I DON'T MEAN MEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	E LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO IT COULDN'T DROP THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T NO WITCH NUMBER

Line_4426	M YEAH SO
Line_4427	THREY OR A HUNDRED THE CUP HUNDRED
Line_4428	YEAH WE GOT THE LITTLE ONE AH
Line_4429	MMM WE PUT SOM WATER LIKE THAT AND THEN WE PUT IN THE CAN
Line_4430	WHAT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBER YEAH
Line_4431	UM I LEARNED THAT
Line_4432	THAT MEARICAWS DE ALL NAME PLACE THAT SOM IS THE ELECTRIC SISTOM
Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THEY IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT NOT ALL STRAWS AR THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	OR THEY SOME OF THEM WERE SOR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE PUT IT OUT HM WE COULD WELL UM ONCE WE PUT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WEE
Line_4440	UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH BUT UM WEE
Line_4442	MEASURED UM THE BOOK SHELES
Line_4443	BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN'T THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE CLOSED THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO ER
Line_4444	M UH NO
Line_4445	WELL UHM LIKE OUR SAD WE TRID TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WEILL ONE ENCH SIX AND TWO
Line_4446	I MEAN NO
Line_4447	IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4448	BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE A LITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT AND THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
Line_4449	IT WAS NON I MEAN THREE MMM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS E
Line_4451	IT'S NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STANDARD THE UN OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAMS
Line_4455	LIKE I CA THESE WERE LIKE THE COUBS THE ONE AND THE FIVE L
Line_4456	UM YEAH IT'S DIVIDED BY
Line_4457	YES THE THE CHIP
Line_4458	YES DURING THE RESULTS WORE IS
Line_4459	YEAH M LIKE THAT BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOME TIMES
Line_4461	UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CUB JUST USE PAPER CLIPS INSTAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL IN TO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRIDED TO GET WITH OUR OUR GRAMS WE TRIDED TO GET
Line_4464	IN STAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL THOSE BULKS WE COULD JUST USE
Line_4465	THE THAT AT TEN A
Line_4466	THAT TEN AND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE THE WHOCKS THATWOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	UM THE KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TRNS DO IN SO IT TOOK A LONGER ONE SO JUST ONE PERSON

Line_4477	UM YES EXCEPT WE DIDN'T LIKE TO COLD M WE JUST SIDE IT IN THE WATER
Line_4478	YEAH
Line_4479	YES LAST YEAH
Line_4480	THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN END IT AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN US
Line_4481	UM WELL EAM
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FOUL CRUM AND THE BALANCED
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT IT'S LIKE BY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE YEAH BIG WHEN YOU CALLS A GRAM
Line_4486	YOU'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT
Line_4487	YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH W FIRST I HOLD IN MY HANDS AND I WEIGH THEN YOU PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USED
Line_4490	MMM THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL I NO
Line_4491	YEAH H YEAH
Line_4492	UM I'M A SHURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WIG NOT ALL THE WAI
Line_4494	M NOT A FREELY
Line_4495	YEAH ONE MILLIS
Line_4496	M ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT IT JUST FLIPED UP M
Line_4498	I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S TRYING TO TRICK US BUT IF YOU JUST DID THAT W YOU AT A REALLY DID THAT
Line_4499	HO WELL THEN YOU PROBLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
Line_4500	THAT'S THAT'S OUR UM
Line_4501	THE LIME WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FOOL IT WOULD BE NO
Line_4502	YEAH IT CAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK IT COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE IS WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND PLASTIC TIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCAIEL THING WE WOULD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AND IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD YOU PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LOOK ON EVEN
Line_4507	IT UM THERE IS MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THEN IT WOULD
Line_4508	HELPS UM
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TWO
Line_4510	MAEAH AND E
Line_4511	TO CAUSE A HUNDRED I NOW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TO THE HOW MANY GRAMS AND THEN WILD GO TO BAT IT'S FLOWTEN IT'S FLOWTING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND SHE M
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROPBLY PROBLY WOULD EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CURRES AND GO OSOM
Line_4516	FOKAY BYE-BYE
Line_4517	UM YEAH
Line_4518	HI UM
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SALKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHED IT PUT ANOTHER PUT M THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPUNGE STIMETE DID NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	I FORGOT WHAT SOLKED UP ALL WATERS IT COULD THEN WE WEIGHED IT AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_4526	TO A CLEEN BECAUSE I SHO AS WEIGHT AND WITH DIRTY WATER WOULD EXSOURBD THE DIRTY WATER MMM
Line_4527	NO ONE THEN I NO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMTY CUPS CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
Line_4530	IT HOLDS COAL SE YOU'LL NOISE HAVE THE TOP OF THAT EGEN TOP THE PUR
Line_4531	A KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND EVERY KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUN RED UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMALE GRAM SO A KILOGRAM IS PROPLY GOD TO BE IT IS HEAVY IS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS OR TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT WODN'T WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THE STALE HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER IS A PICHERE'S AS HEAVY AS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOGRAM PLUS ONE ELL OH THE WATER LITERS
Line_4541	YEAH THIS MISS DULL ICE FUN PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPONGE WE MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WEIGHT SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPONGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WEE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	N IT'S FIVE AND THEN EX ONE THEN
Line_4546	IT WILL INSTEAD OF ALWASE HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THEY CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALLED OUT SO FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS IT CAN AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THEN SHOULD BE SIX TEEN MAKE UP THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S AR LOCK AIRUH LOCKUIT IN SIDE OF IM
Line_4551	AND YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FOULL OF AIR
Line_4552	UH THERE IS UM YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER THE WATERS HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY ARE LIKE ALL THE ER LIES GO ALL WAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	IF YOU ACTUALLY WEIGHT BASE IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	Y SO YOU CAN'T GO BACK UP THE HERS
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT C WITH THE WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCAIL AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FROUTS OUR VECHTIABLES AND
Line_4559	PUT THE SCAIL IN WAYSED
Line_4560	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4561	SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOL SEEING THING WA HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SICSTAM BECAUSE THE PROPELLAR IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	THE IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE G IN THEY HAVE TO PUT IN A GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL UM THEY CAN BREAK
Line_4565	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROPGOS AND SEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BASIS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BALNSES OFF
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING TH AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MIX IS A PER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT A BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HEIGHT BECAUSE THE STIT CAN BREAK
Line_4571	AND WE THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEING HOW FAR GO MAYBE
Line_4572	YOU WE THE HEAVIER BULB BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE IF YOU CAN DO THAT TO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT WHOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEING THE LITTLE THE BLACK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOTHS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PANALLUMS IN THE BOTHS AND SEEING HOW MANY PANALLIUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOTH
Line_4577	UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PAGNICK IN THEM
Line_4578	WEE
Line_4579	YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF LIGHE BULBS YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I BILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTING PANES IN IT OR WASHER
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BULB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PANILLAMSM AND THE LITTLE BULB
Line_4583	WAY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT KNUMBER OF PANECES BECAUSE THEY CO IT THEM SHORTER R LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND SE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHUREDIST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIR PINE COULD FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIR PLAN FLIY
Line_4588	I THINK THE THE THINGS THAT I AM POINTING WHEN YOU'RE FING YOUR PLAIN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCE AND IT'S NOT WHEN ILING A LOT AND THAT YOU'R PROPELLER SPINE
Line_4589	I THINK HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECANT ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DOWN AND IF I GOES UP IT'S GOING TO GO ABOUT DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAT
Line_4590	BUT IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TWO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PRPELLAR THE STRING IS MIKING UP BALANCE AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE PERPLECHIPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLAR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4593	O CACE HOW MANY SPAN IT TAKE SPANS ARE FORTY FIVE SPAN MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLARS SPIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIVER ROUND THE WATER IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONE SETTING UP TO MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
Line_4597	ALL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNEY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION WE STD ON THE EXAXICIS THE PENSUL IN LENGTH JUST THE PENDULUM LIKE AND NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAM FOR PRODUCTING WHAT'S FOR TEN THE PANGULOM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETERS SWITING WOULD BE A TEINTY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST YOU COULD TEST YOUR PRODUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT SHURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PANGULUM AFICS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THE PANGULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORT PUNULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PANULUMS AND BOTHS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PANES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHOCK A PANY AT THE ILL AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM IN RANSUMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANSUMLY YOUR BOTH WILL TIP OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE ABOUT S COULD 'VE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHER IS AND THE FOR AND A COULD'VE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
Line_4609	HOW THE PANIES WERE STACKED WOULD THEY A WOULD STACKED REALLY SLOPILY AND D WOULD STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE DOES DOW MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS OF A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YEES
Line_4612	I CAN REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARED
Line_4613	UH CORK AND YEAH
Line_4614	AN EN WE ALSO MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCEIS WAS
Line_4615	U I THINK SO
Line_4616	UM THE METER STICK UH IS STANDING UP AND AND
Line_4617	M I UM AND AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S CLIPING
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE AG IS BOUNSING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS BOUNSING OFF THE WALL AND ONTO THE GROWND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKING AIR PLANS AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HEAH IKE GRASS ABOUT PANCIUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PUNGULUM HAH IS FIFTY
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LEFT SIDE UM
Line_4625	ITS AND NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT'S HOW MANY SWUNG IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF SWAINS AND THE PEN TO ONE THAT LESE IT IS
Line_4628	WELL WE WHAT WE DID IT WAS JUST MAKING THE PLAIN THAT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	THAT WAS THE AR PLAIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WERE MAKING IN SOME OT
Line_4630	WE HAD UM THAT
Line_4631	A LITTLE PADDLE THING FOR THE WENDSING FOR THE FRUNT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN AND SWING THE LINE
Line_4633	IT HAS BEEN TRIED TO PLAIN YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE M TRARED IT YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THING I YOU FOUR ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANYTHING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I NOW I I I CAN'T REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MINE BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS A UM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRASS WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOUR SELF UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WELL I NOW I'M LOOKING UP THE LINE WOULD BE UM I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	IT'S GOING OH YOU HAVE
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARKED THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WERE THE PANULUM LENGTH MAYBE MARKS ON HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	UM THE NUMBERS ARE LIGHT UP THERE AND UM THE NAME RA IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PEANULLAUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THE THE BOTTOM THAT OR THE HIGIEST NO
Line_4646	H MIS CALLAM THE WHILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING HARE YOU HAD THINGS
Line_4648	HIS UM STRADY LEARNING OF OUT CATEFULBS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL ABOUT
Line_4650	ADE IT A POPICALE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THERE
Line_4651	THE THING YOU I SEE THE POPSICAL STICK THAT THING YOU PUT ON A UM TRUMMM THE
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORK YOU AND THE ROBBERS THE RAERSTOPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM THAT W I DON'T THINK IT'S CONNECT JUST RILLY FAR
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES FLIN UP UM IT LEFT CLIP STICK
Line_4655	UM MA THING CAN THE
Line_4656	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOTHS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FLOW AND THEIR RA THERE R THEY'LL UM RA
Line_4658	SHE FLOWED UP WATER AND UM PEOPLE TO GET ON THEM AND SEE THE OION
Line_4659	SISERS UM WATER AND THE UM THAT'S IT
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PANIES IT COULD CAM
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UM PEOPLE
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PANTS IT COULD'VE FILL INTO A CHALANDRED
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT OUST RAINING ABATE
Line_4664	HAS OUT OF PANIES UM THERE'S SOME PAN CAN THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWING ON THE WATER
Line_4665	THERE MIND ME OF LIKE THE PEN ICE BEING PASSINCHERS
Line_4666	I THEY WE MAY MADE ABOUT HOW MANY PANELS WE HAVE TO PUT UNTOL IT EX THING
Line_4667	TWICE CLOWS UP IT IT SINGS FASTER BECAUSE M
Line_4668	BECAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT THAND WHEN YOU THROUGH IT UM FROM HI
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHS UM
Line_4670	HA CAN UM CACES TO THAT'S SMALLER AND THE UM TRICK ONES CARY MORE BECAUSE IT THE BECAUSE IT'S TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CA CAN CARY MORE CUP TH AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CA CASE THAT BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER
Line_4672	WE COULD SHORT IN AND OUT AND THI COULD ME
Line_4673	THINK IT'S A ISH Y IT'S A PICH LIKE THE CAN LIKE THE CIND OF STRING YOU USE TO CATCH FISCHE
Line_4674	IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T LIKE US IN THE CHAIN TO FIND IT
Line_4675	IT DIDN'T REALLY SHAKE YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON OM THE STRING YOU WOULD TA TO SHARES AND PUT THE AIR PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ONES THEY WOULD TAKE TO PUT MAKE IT E
Line_4677	IT GIPS IT MORE AIR SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN THEY CAN FLOW FASTER
Line_4678	WITHOUT THE REPELLAR WOULDN'T LIGHT BECAUSE ANY UN AND THEROBERPAM WOULD HAVE NOR TO UM TO
Line_4679	SURE ON THE COMPUTOR NICED IT ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKES THE REVER BAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF ER AND SPIN IT AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THEY HAVE TWO AIR PLAINS AND THEN ONE A STRING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S CALL UN DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GONNA NEED TO WEIGH MORE AR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RIVER ANT UM SWINGS LIKE TURNS AROUND UM THE PERPELLAR IS GOING SO THEY CAN'T GET MORE ARE
Line_4686	THEY ARE TO A BAPROMCE THERANDLE
Line_4687	MAKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS CON HANKING AROWND LIKE NOT THAT TIGHE
Line_4688	THIS SCRAP IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAPING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOOD
Line_4690	ICE PAMPIUAL IS WHERE MOUNT N WELL ALL ARE
Line_4691	ABOUT SE ING HOW FAR THE CLIP TER WELL THE CORK WOULD GO
Line_4692	I SAW LIKE A DROP OR E
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A
Line_4694	IT RMEAIN THAT ABOUT HOW YOU U THE FASTER SLOWER T
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PANULUMS AND HOW THEY SQWENING IT
Line_4696	THE GRAFT IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PANSULLUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PANGULLUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ARADY SWAYING OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PRODUCTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL IN THE THE THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN IT
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLAT THE FLIGHT LIN IS THAT
Line_4701	REVERBAND I IT JUST THE PREPELLAR BARLIVE AND SPIN WHETEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRASS WITH UN EX AND Y AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PACSINGURS ON THE Y AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EX AXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PACSINGARS ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU GATHERED IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WEIGH UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAISE ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	THE Y AXIS IS OLWASE LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	E'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PANGULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRAND FOTHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PANGULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TYPE THAT WE MADE AND CLASS A FOU DAYSE AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES AT ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS E SECUANT GOES AND AFTER A WIL IT STARTS TO SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPOSIT SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER R MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEIR IN OF LIKE CATPULBS YOU PUSH DOWN
Line_4724	N THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKE YOU ABLE TO SH
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I NOW IT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	ER WHAT I THINK IS THE HIGHER THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHIFT
Line_4728	IT SEAMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIR THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WAY SO THEN IT SHOES PRITY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPERBACE IS WHERE YOU PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK YIT PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STICKS ARE EACH CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HI IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIR OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPERBACE AND WITH SHUTING FLIPERBACERS WITH SHUTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON THE PLASSTICK ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS HIVE
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING PEANGIULUMS AND TODAY WE DOD HOW DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BEBECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A LATCH LATCH SHORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING THE TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	AND STUDYING PANIULUMS
Line_4749	THEY CEEP I'M KIND OF LIKE ON A GRAM FOTHER CLOCK THEY CEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'LD SINK THE BO
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE IT DIFFERENCES
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU TEST AN NOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A BIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACURET AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LICFF BULBS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	OU AREDY ASCK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOOT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIME
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE THAT WAS IN HERE ON THIRSEDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TWO HARD IT MIGHT SINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK ERLLIER THAN USUAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAINS
Line_4763	THE HIRE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT
Line_4764	E HIR OR THE MORE PASSANGURS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE CRAFTD ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE WIYE LIN WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSINGERS AND THE EX LIGN WAS WHERE WET
Line_4767	THE MORE PASSENGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HADD THE MORE PACONGERS IT COULD HOLD
Line_4769	EX IS THE COMPACITY OF THE BO AND THAT'S WERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THE
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENTY F IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PASSENGERS THAT CANT BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANYONE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	THERE IS A PANY CONNECTED TO A PENSL AND THE PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWAING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT CAN GO TH UM THE MORE TIMES TWO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPER CLIP THE PENNY AND THE PENSAL
Line_4779	UH THE STRING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THE LALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PENS GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE UH FASTRITTLE SWING SIDEWAYS
Line_4783	STUDYING THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWING IN SIDE WAYS
Line_4785	THERE IS A PANY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	UH TANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE SONG IT SIDE WAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT COULD SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFTEY AND FIFTEEN CECUANDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	OH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UM IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PANIULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID AT THE LAST STARING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	Y THINK CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATPULES
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPERYBASE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR THE CLICK GOES AFTER YOU LANCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CORK UH LIKE FLIE
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LANCED THE CORK
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO LITTLE SQUAR SHAPE STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIR STICK
Line_4802	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CIG WAS WACHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN ACHE THE CORK
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LANCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO FARTHER
Line_4805	I NOTICE THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT FIRTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WEIGHT OF THE CORCT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PANIEUUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PANY AND THE IT MAKES THE PANY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT'S SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S A GRAFT TO SEE HOW LONG THE PONGULNES
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM BIGEST TO THE LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE A ESTIMATE IS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SOBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS MEY THAT THE NUMBER OF SWING IS GETTING UH LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH IS I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PEANY ON IT'LL STOELL BE THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULD SEE YOUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID UH STUFF ABOUT BOTHS AND HOW MANY PANIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT THINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE PENIESE IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UHM I DON'T FROM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UM PANIESE ARE LIKE PASCSANGUERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL L IF THERE IS MORE PAN S ON ONE SIDE AND ON ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COAL TIP OVER AND THINK
Line_4825	SOMEONE'S DROPING MORE PENNIES IN TO THE BOTH
Line_4826	MAKE SHORE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BOUT
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER AND TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING MY A GRASS ABOUT UH BOTH
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE A BUNCH OF THINGS
Line_4831	I IT WOULD LIKE THINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COALN HOLD
Line_4834	I PICK YOURED OUT THAT UM THE BIGGER THE LIFF BULBS THE MORE PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG ER WIDE THE BOT IS
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PANIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOT
Line_4837	IS THE BIGIST SO TO HOLD MORE PASSONGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PANIES IT CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PASSONGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY UH OF THE BULB WHICH IS MIL
Line_4840	UH WELL THE SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GRATEST TO LEITEST OR LITEST LEAST TO GOODEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THE NUMBER IS RISING UP
Line_4843	THE EX AXES IS THE WHEN THE CAPACITY MILLMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PACIANGURS AND THE GOING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EX AXES IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE Y AXES IS ON SO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WY AXIS SHOWS HOW MANY PASSINGURS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE Y AXIS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOOT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALLLER TENTIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PANIES
Line_4850	I NOTICE THAT THE THE NUMBER OF THE COMPACI THE PACINGERS GOT LOGER AS THE CAPACITY GO
Line_4851	IT THE PASSONGURS NUMBER ETHER SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH TO THE DIFFERENCES AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOTORS A REVER BANS AND WHY IS A DISTANCE
Line_4854	BANS THE PRITY FAR
Line_4855	WELL PASED LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WOULLD BE EASIER TO LIST N
Line_4856	WELL YOU PACE THE WY THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE AND THEN IT WOULD B IT WILL BE LIKE DOING THERE SO IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGED LIKE HOW MANY RIVER BANS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASSONGUERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WING
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSANGERS SO THE DISTANCE WILL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FHOU DAYSE AGO WE POLLUTED PAPER AR PINS
Line_4860	UM WE MADE UH HEANY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PANE
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TWO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LD CHANGED TWO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PANCILUM SWINGS BACK AND FOR
Line_4863	SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PEANY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF ITS SHORTER IT WILL PULL FAT SLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TWO MAY VARIABLES THAT ONESE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE DR A LOT OF TIME
Line_4869	THE SHOURTER IT GETS A FAT THEN MORE SWINGS IT THAT IT TAKES
Line_4870	SWITH THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE THINGS IT HAS
Line_4871	UM LETS THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORCH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT TAKES THE OTHER ONES THAT THE SHORT OF THE STRAINING IS THE THE HAIR THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PRODUCTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND HER OF THE PER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRITY MUCH OF WHAT WE DID SO F WERE GOING TO START UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MORO
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CORK AND THEN INTO LANCH AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR IT WILL GO
Line_4876	THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPISS THE CORCERS WERE MORGAN TO WANCH AND THEN THE REVER SOPER IT HELPS STICKY UP AND T
Line_4877	IT UM NOT SHURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE SLIPER BACE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RUVER STOCK
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A MIXTURE OF THE FLIPER
Line_4880	YEAH THE WEIGHT MAY UM AFFECTS HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4881	YEAH WILL PROPERLY TRY AND NOT THE S TO MORNOW
Line_4882	FOR UM WE MAKE ESTHER A DRAFT OR OR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A TURT
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER CA IT CAN RIP IT BEFOR IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	IT WAS IMPORTNT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WERENT DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PANEIESE
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIGHTER OR TALLER THEY WELL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PANIES
Line_4886	HOW M HO TALL THE BO WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD THINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOM IT MY T HAVE BABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UN LIKE S IF
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE AND IF YOU IN JUST DROP THEM IN AT MY T LINE MAKE IT THINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDTAL THE LS HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM ON EVERY LE SINK ATER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PANIES BECAUSE THEY NOT AS TALLER AND IT WILL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONE ABOUT SONK YOU TOOK ONE PANY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PANIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BUT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVER FILL THE BO
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE ESIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORS OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY M
Line_4897	CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T WOULD KNO IF AND OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER IT WON'T WORK LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TWO MANY THINGS
Line_4899	WELL IF THEY ARE WRONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU LACK ONE ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO THINK IF YOU STUCK UM IN THE MIDDL LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT WILL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD M
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACRENT MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EACH CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG WAS STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONES FILL TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S AXIDENTALLY NINE IT WILL BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	IF WOULD SEE UM OR
Line_4905	BUT THE SMALLER ONE MAY HOLD LESS AMOUNT OR PANIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MADE FOUR PAPER BS SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WASHERS THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PANIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	ARMS WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4908	TO HOLD PANIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM T
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PANIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL A BO IS
Line_4913	U DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU CETALMIN AND YOU KEEP THE EVEN IT WILL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL THINK BUT IF YOU PUT IN THE MIDDAL IT'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE TWENTIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE I THINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MITTAL YOU CAN HOLD MORE PANIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER S SO RUFF THE BO T CAN TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S COM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PAN S THEN IT WILL STICK UP
Line_4917	THE THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WILN'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T NO IF YOU MADE EM A SMALLER A BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE LESS
Line_4919	THAT UM WE G
Line_4920	ACITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER TS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PACANGERS THEY CAN HOLD WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FORDIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE CAN H WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH NE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOT IS THE LESS PASSANGUERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLP MORE BUT IF YOU PUT A ALL TO THE SIDE IT WILL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4926	IT'S H CAPACITES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND
Line_4929	THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIR SODA AS THE NUMBER OF PASSONGURS
Line_4930	THAT EIRKING THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PACSONGERS
Line_4931	HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PACANGERS IT GETS IN MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	I I SOL HURTS
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DIPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PACSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW WE C WHEN WE SPAN HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PROPELLAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS PROPELLER UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODDY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STREEM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU WINED UP THE PERPELLAR
Line_4938	WELL MEAN BY PARTNER WE PUT OUR AND ON WE LEARNED THAT IF YOU PUT A ANKLE IT
Line_4939	EFFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLIY
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLAR AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOR SIX A SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE PICK IT OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOS AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GO SLOWER AND IT WILL GO AS FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WINES IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NON OUT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PREASHERE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL MO THE LESS PASSANGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER A DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSANGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT EFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF IT MADE THAT WORCE OR MAKE IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FICKER OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WOERSER
Line_4949	ELL IF LIKE YOU TAKE OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS AND MIGHT EFECT THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICE THAT WITH ONCSE AGAIN WITH
Line_4952	M WITH MORE PASS AS YOU ADD MORE PASSANGERS THE LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROBLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR AROUND THAT
Line_4954	NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE REPER BANS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE CASSER AND AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID MY
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS UM TO CHANGE WHAT HAPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE SAW HOW FAST THEY CAN GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO A DISC AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESCK AND THEN JUST LIGHT GO IF IT COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TROO YEAH AND WE TRIDED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIDE HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE COULD SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THEM
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I STICKED SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPINING
Line_4968	THE FLIPSTHAT C
Line_4969	IT SHOES HOW MANY CENTEMETAS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMETS
Line_4970	I SEE WHEN MY UM CLICK IT'S GOING FOOD THROUGH
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE OFF THINGS RA THE EX PER ON THEN IT MADDERS WHAT IT IS
Line_4972	FORM AND YEAH TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE OFF THINGS IT WILL THE I LIMIT MIGHT BE WRONG AND YOU'LL NOT SHOURE IF SIZE OR NOT
Line_4974	IT DEFECTS THE WILL DISSOLVES BECAUSE YOU UH
Line_4975	IT'S OR WA SHOW
Line_4976	IT'S COUNT BY TENS AND IT'S MOVING UP BY CEMIMETES
Line_4977	IT'S GAYING HIR AND HIR
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE PANGIYLLUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HI YOU HELD THE STRING
Line_4980	SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WEE UM MEASURED UN UM
Line_4983	ON MEASURING TO
Line_4984	WEE CEP THE PANY ON THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE LU THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE OTION AND THEY CARY PEOPLE PASSONGERS AND SOME TIMES EMEARGIENTSY LUGIDG
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DROUGH A CROSS
Line_4987	WE BILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANT SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZE
Line_4990	SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PAINTES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACE MATES
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIZE THE PLACE MAN OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I THINK YOULD UM I DON'T KNOW VAL VARIABLES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOUT THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS ETHER GOES DOWN UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOTHS WERE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH OF WEIGHT
Line_5000	WEE DID BYE US DOING EVERYTHING ON EVERY MAKING THEIR BOTS PRITY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE Y AXIS IS THAT UM THE NUMBER OF PASSANGURS THE BOT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT FAR CALL LINE
Line_5005	WITCH WARDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW VARY YOUR BULBS CHANGED THE ELS
Line_5008	THAT IT DIPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE OT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE OT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACONERS GETS SMALLER TWOSO PRITY MUCH IS ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BY MARNEY HAVE A NICE STAY
Line_5011	HI MY NAME IS CAP AND I AM IN S AM WHEN YOU TOLD ME A QUASTION
Line_5012	CROPACYEAH MEASUREMENT DECLINE AND SOMEMIT
Line_5013	ALL ABOUT HEIGHT AH I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE QUIT
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A ROLLER AND OH A METER STICK
Line_5016	HEY ARE TOBS
Line_5017	AND TALL AND AN TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WOW UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	UH I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	UM NOW I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I DO NOT ALL IN
Line_5022	THE DOORNUB ON THE PIXTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOLES THAT YOU CAN ALWASE USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SOTY
Line_5025	I SEE ONE ME TEN METER A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WITH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN RORES
Line_5028	I DON'T KNOB MEAN I NO ABOUT WHAT DOWOERE
Line_5029	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A ROLER
Line_5030	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET HAS WHAT THEY CALL A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HA
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BOBS YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IS TEN SATAMINEARS UM IN THIS PIXTURE
Line_5034	THOSE HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS AL AND ALL
Line_5035	THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A LOER AND HE'S OR MOST MORE COMAN
Line_5037	THIS BAY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS STARTED OUT A QUARNER AND IT WILL ALWAYSE GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
Line_5039	UH WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LARNCE CENTIMETERS ANCH IS MILLIMETERS YEARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABBY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THE
Line_5043	SOME ARE THE SAME WING
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU COULD USE A ROLEAR OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN A METER STICKS AND ROLARS
Line_5047	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5048	AND WEIGH IN THEM WITH THE CAL
Line_5049	I DRONOT TO HOLB
Line_5050	WELL THER WEIGHTS THAT OR LIKE CUL IT THIS TO LIGHT ST
Line_5051	IS HEAVIER THAN CHIP
Line_5052	METALS HEAVIER THAN CLAY DON'T ANSWER
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST AID THE MAGNET WENT THE THE TEN WOODN'T THEN THE WOODEN BLOCK AND THEN THE JU
Line_5054	I DON'T WELL THE AMPSWER SO'S AT A QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING BALANCED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR THE COULD SEE THEN UH MAKE IT MEASURE SO THE METAL
Line_5056	THE MIDDLE WASHER IS HEAVIER THAN CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S A VBESTWAITE BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURE SHOULD ME THAT NOT THE MIDDLE ASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MORE A CARE MATES
Line_5061	WLM M IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT U LITTLE
Line_5062	WELL MEASUREING IT'S NOT BUT WELL I FORGET NOT
Line_5063	WE USED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THESE ARE PAPER QUIPS
Line_5065	WELL SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE AND THE BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIP SMALL ONE PAPER C IT
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME SOL BECAUSE ONE'S HEAVIEST AND ONE'S NOT HEAVI
Line_5068	THE LITTLE COB IN FRONT THEY MEAN AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS FORE GRAMS ALL THE WAIGH UNTIL THE CITY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	MILL PICTURE TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THE METAL WASHER
Line_5072	ON SAND SIX FIVE ARE THREE TWO ONE THEN THE LITTLE WASHER GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE BALAM
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAM TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	ME GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	EAROKAY UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH I DO NOT
Line_5078	I DO THAT I DON'T ON'T KNU AND I DID NOT R
Line_5079	I DON'T KNEE EVEN KNOW RAVFERENCES T
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENSL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THESE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKES SEVTY GRAMS IT THAT TO LIKE TO MEASURE THAT SI CURRENT KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	UH UH I DON'T OU DON'T KNOW
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TWO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEAD MORE GRAMS TO A TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUSE GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVY AND YOU USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WALL I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SCIENCE D
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASURE MAGNET MEASURE MAN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN MEASURE
Line_5092	ALL A MATURE OH ARE MAIN MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE COURTS OF WATER MAYBE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S A LINES AND THAT COULD PROBABLY THE IN HOW MUCH IT COULD PROB YOU HOLBD
Line_5095	WELL VILE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND BY THE ONE COULD HOLD MORE LIKE TWICE A MUCH BILE TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VILE COULD POP THROUGH
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS THATWAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER IS HOLDING A THOUSAND MIITERS OR A ONE ONLY KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UHM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH CAN
Line_5100	I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOSIS ONE A MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM MILLILITERS SO DON'T MUCH MA HOLDER HOW IF IT COULD BE WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED NIITES AND THE BIG FAT TO BE ING THOUSAND ILLIMITERS
Line_5104	IS TEN LITTLE TWO BES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILLILITER
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BE TRICK YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS
Line_5106	UM WELL I FORGOT
Line_5107	MILL METER IS BIGGER AND OLLETERS SMALL
Line_5108	IF YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS A FU INCHES NOBLMETERS OR LIETERS
Line_5110	IT COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	IT'S A MILL METERS NO METERS ON THE WITH
Line_5113	WELL IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCIENCE TOOLS
Line_5114	UM WELL WE M WE YOU COULD PUT THE WATER AND THE CERAIN AND WHEN YOU ULD SPRING IT INTO SOMETHING TO SAY HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS THREE CIRANCHES TOO FILL
Line_5116	WELL SMACANCAH YEAH
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS AND FILL CUP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE OR HOW MUCH IT WILL BUT WELL THEN SI WE STOP FIFTEE MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES TROPERS AND HOW MANY WALLS
Line_5120	IT IS A RAGSULATED SONDER
Line_5121	THINK IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN ONLY A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER AND OR A LIQUIDS IN IT
Line_5123	OH THERE'S MORE GRAGUWATED SILUNDER SAD FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND NILITERS
Line_5124	UM I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO FIND MANE
Line_5125	WHEN YOU PRODICT YOU COULD MAKE A AN ESTIMATE AND MAKE A LIN AND SEE IF IT WOULD GO OVER UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING AS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN AS
Line_5127	I CO TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL IT TO WA AND LAND AND ONE MAR SEE
Line_5129	I DON'T KNOW THE CAPACITY WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDIED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHEN I UM AERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW CAPACITY AS HOW TALL
Line_5132	THE CUP AND WELL HAS MORE THAN A OR MARGE
Line_5133	WE HAVE ALL T CAPACITY SO NOT ALL I KNOW
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A WATER AND A CONTAINER AND YOU FILL IT WITH CAPACITY
Line_5135	S S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER OF VESSAL
Line_5136	THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL WHOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIR FAT OR SCINIER AND THEY COULD JUST DON'T HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	LIKE WELL EVERY ONE EVERY CINGAL ONE YOU PUT IN IT'S A HUNDRED AND EQUALS TO DRUM MILLILITERS WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLB THE SAME M OF WATER
Line_5139	UM O MAROM
Line_5140	I DON'T KNOW THE CAPACITY IS
Line_5141	THIS IS NOT A MILLY BUT THIS IS A GRADJUALANE AND ITS SILANDER
Line_5142	SOUNDER
Line_5143	THE USING AIR
Line_5144	THAT'S ON THE LEFT HAS MORE WONDER AND CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS ST WATER
Line_5145	YOU CAN DICK A S UNREU TRY I WON'T HAD NO WHAT'S O MORE
Line_5146	Y LEADS THEN R RAN YOU CAN USE A CIRMAN PUT ON FIFTY EN FIFTY AN FIFTY TOE FILED UP
Line_5147	WON'T TO E
Line_5148	YOU MUST ADD THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5149	WELL IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MAN
Line_5150	USING THE WAW USING THEM
Line_5151	IS HOW AE LESS
Line_5152	NO I OBSERVED LOLUM
Line_5153	I MEAN NO
Line_5154	HENCE HOW MUCH IT CAN ALL AND CAPACITY TO THE VERY TIPE TOP
Line_5155	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD A CAPACITY
Line_5156	NOT NO
Line_5157	IF MAY ALL IN IT HOLE MORE AND ONE CAN
Line_5158	WE IT CAN HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD THAT H THAT'S ALL I SH
Line_5159	I KNOW THE THAT
Line_5160	THE COMMATY AT BECAUSE WELL I DIFFERENT THINGS ARE LIKE LESS AND
Line_5161	UM CAN ONLY FIFTY ONE COULD ONLY A HUNDRED ONE CAN ONLY THOUSAND IT'S ONE LITER
Line_5162	ALL WHAT'S GOING ON IS
Line_5163	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5164	UH THINEAHEST FROM GOD
Line_5165	IT HOLBS A HUNDRED DILITERS
Line_5166	YOU COULD USE THILINIRUMS OR BEKERMS OR CENTIMETERS LIKE ALL
Line_5167	I CON SA SIRRANGE
Line_5168	YOU PULL IT UP AND THE WATER F
Line_5169	OH IT'S HAVE FOR RIGHT NO
Line_5170	MAYBE LIKE A PAMCINY
Line_5171	HOUNDRED FORTY AH HUNDRED FORMS
Line_5172	ELL YOU HAD UP HOW MUCH IT WOULD HOLD AND IT'S HOLDING UP
Line_5173	BECAUSE THE WATER WAS JUST ON I COULD
Line_5174	MEAN WELL FILLSOMLOH PAN
Line_5175	THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE WRAPS
Line_5176	UM WELL VERY SINGLE MIN IT THE TEMPERATURE DROPD WITH THE WITH THE CUP WITH THE ISE IN IT
Line_5177	I FORGOT I TH A
Line_5178	WELL IT SO M THAT'S COLD AND IT CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
Line_5179	WELL WE DID UM WELL EVERY MINT WE WOULD HACK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT AR THING
Line_5180	UM WE PUT OUT UM HOW MUCH SOLCIES
Line_5181	IT SAYS FIFT AM S
Line_5182	WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE APT FORT
Line_5183	WELL THEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IT ON
Line_5184	WE OBSERVED TEN MINET
Line_5185	WELL IT CHANGES BUS COLD AND IT ARE FREE
Line_5186	UM IT GOES UP AND IT GOES DOWN
Line_5187	A AND SOCIAS ANDRE
Line_5188	AL CAN TELL YOU
Line_5189	WELL EACH SCRATCHED SEE THE I IT YOU CAN CAR YOUR WAIT UP TO WHERE THE T
Line_5190	IT BELOWS HERE IT'S SO A
Line_5191	ONE THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE NONE OF THEM SAYS TWEN
Line_5192	BUT WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GASS IN IT AND THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO UP
Line_5193	IT'S CALLED UM NRYEAH AND ONE O GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
Line_5194	MY NAME IS SARAW UM I REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
Line_5195	YES AND THEN REALLY EXCITED TO START
Line_5196	WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MALTIPICACION AND DIVISION
Line_5197	UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE
Line_5198	UM LIKE IS UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
Line_5199	THEY MAY COME UP WITH A DISCIION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT A STANDARD
Line_5200	IT SHOWS HOW LONG A METER IS AND HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE AND A METER
Line_5201	MORE SE IN SIDE MIC STUDY FOR LIKE RAY LONG THINGS OR REALLY SHOURT THINGS YEAH
Line_5202	OW LONG THE DOOR NOB IS FROM THE FLOOR
Line_5203	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE METRIC SISTOM AND THE WORLBS
Line_5204	WELL WHAT OUR TEACHERS SAYS IF WE USE HER PINKE FIRST CENTIMETERS AND YOU OMIDIM PINKIE FOUR ADRESSIMITS
Line_5205	UM THE SAY I DON'T KNOW
Line_5206	WELL VESALS AND ALS SAYING PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND I HAVE TO LOOK THE SAME
Line_5207	UM FORTY GOOD
Line_5208	WITH LIKE A METER OR ROLE OR YARDS STUCK
Line_5209	TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL THINGS
Line_5210	YOU GET A MORE PROSICE ESTIMATE
Line_5211	WE MEASURED UM TO RUM FOOT HIDUM
Line_5212	RAYBES NOTICE IS ONE PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIES FINGERS FINGER LIKE
Line_5213	WE UM I'M NOT EXACTLY SHURE BUT A REFERENCE IS
Line_5214	UM I DON'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER PRAY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONES IVE TOLD YOU
Line_5215	WE'VE BEEN SENDING THE STANDARDS SO AND OTHER UM STAN
Line_5216	UM COMPARING MASS WE DO MAGNES
Line_5217	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE NETAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE HEAVIEST
Line_5218	E YOU COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND OR EANYWARE
Line_5219	UM MEASIN AM SMORE ACURRLEAE THAN YEAH
Line_5220	EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHTS
Line_5221	TWO S LIKE PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIP
Line_5222	HAVE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5223	WE'LL GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5224	H UM
Line_5225	REM HAD TO EXPLAIN
Line_5226	OCK WE USED GRAM BLOCKS
Line_5227	UM GRAMS UH OH
Line_5228	ONE THEY THE CUP EQUALS ONE GRAM BO
Line_5229	UM I PICK IT OUT
Line_5230	IN GRAMS EQULE ONE METAL DISC
Line_5231	IT ALL BE UM IT AULLD BE LIKE RAY
Line_5232	OM THE STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS
Line_5233	THE STANDARD AND ALSO ANCHES AND UM FEET
Line_5234	WOULD AM SORY FOR THE PAUSE BIG POS
Line_5235	WEIGHT WING
Line_5236	GRAMS ARE ABOUT UM WE'RE ALL ABOUT UM
Line_5237	UM SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRAMS SOME THINGS
Line_5238	UM I DON'T SAY MAIN THING
Line_5239	GRAMS ARE YOU MA OF MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_5240	THEY ARE NOT NE GRAM PIECTERS
Line_5241	HALLOW
Line_5242	UM THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS YEAH
Line_5243	UH YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5244	IT'S A SMALL RAN UM GUESSING
Line_5245	OH IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAM
Line_5246	WEIGHING HEAVIER THINGS I
Line_5247	IT IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5248	NO EVERYBODY YOU WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
Line_5249	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UM DIFFERENT LENGTH SOME MASS
Line_5250	DRY SPUNCH THAT'S SPUNCH SO SPACE
Line_5251	IT'S REALLY DRY AND IT'S PROMALLY NOT GONG TO WEIGH THAT MUCH
Line_5252	UM IT'S GONG TO WEIGH A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE CILCBUNGED
Line_5253	UM I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SLCKED SPONGE OR A WEIGHT SPUNGE BUT IT'S DEFFANALLY NO I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
Line_5254	NO YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM LOGICLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF WHERE THE SPUNGE IS RIGHT
Line_5255	THE DRY SPUNGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	UH NO MOCH
Line_5257	PUT DRY SPUNGEES TE GRAMS
Line_5258	IT IS SIX AM
Line_5259	UM YOU CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH UM
Line_5260	HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGH HI LADY
Line_5261	AM GRAMS TRYING UM GOOD
Line_5262	HI MARAL
Line_5263	GOOD
Line_5264	THE SANDLGNETISTRAW
Line_5265	YOU COULD WAY THE BOTTOM
Line_5266	GRAM PIECES AND OTHER CUP A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5267	R I LASS FOR THAN SACK
Line_5268	IS THEN THE S VOLID MASS AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVEL YOU CAN MEASURE TO THE SMALL OBJECTS WITH US
Line_5271	MELTING IT PLYING IT BY HUNDREDS
Line_5272	SMALE THINGS
Line_5273	THE THERMOMETERS UM COUNTING BY TONS THIS IS CAN RUNS AND THIS IS COUNTING BY HUNDREDS
Line_5274	UH YEAH THAT'S HARTER TO EXPLAIN I SARY
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR A LIQUID
Line_5277	COOKING BAKING I BELESED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5278	UM BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME AH MILLIMETER LITERS MILLILITERS
Line_5279	SMALL OBJECTS WERE LIQUID OPJECTS
Line_5280	IT'S UHM AN AMOUNT IT'S A SMALL THEN METER
Line_5281	IELE A MEASURING CUP A MADE SHARING SPON
Line_5282	A BALANCE
Line_5283	S COLD BUT IT'S USED FOR METACINNY AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED THE A PROCSICSE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TUSC LIKE THAT
Line_5285	THE MILL LITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBER STHIT THE CIRAINCEH HOLE L AND THIS EARLY FUN TO SCREAL TU
Line_5287	R VOICES ALLOWED TO DY BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	IS A SPILL BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW WA TO THREE
Line_5289	HOSE ARE MILLYMETERS
Line_5290	WE DID SILAUNDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PER SIZE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR SMALL OBJECT
Line_5292	T'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO BE ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINES UM
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HADD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THAN YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A SCRINCH YOU COULD BY CRANE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL ID UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT HOW YOU FIT I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING TALLER BUT SCINIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT UH WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT WILL BE FILLED TO THE GRUM
Line_5301	THEYERY ARE ITHER TALLER BUT SCINIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZERW
Line_5304	ONE MINUTE A SOLID TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN S HOTTER DUM IDEAL CALER
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER AND GOT TWENTY DIGREES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM TE
Line_5308	AND I JUST STAND SO
Line_5309	WELL ARE AM GOING TO MAKE YOUR REPIET
Line_5310	I NEED STAREBOISE FIRST SI
Line_5311	UM A TANSTRALLY QUICKLY I GAS
Line_5312	WE DROUG IT ON GRASS PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE TO UM S
Line_5314	EL AXES OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WELL YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UP UH LAL E
Line_5317	IT'S TIME HOW MUCH THE TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY AND GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICIS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WE AND IT UP
Line_5321	WE GOT IT WAS STUNED AT TWENTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MA GUESS BY FIVE IT
Line_5323	JUST BY COWNDING BY TENOR FIFTY
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF IT'S WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT ITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE AND THE UM
Line_5328	COULD BY AM REALLY SORY TO SAY THIS BIG
Line_5329	HOLLOW MY NAME IS MAXE I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH ROLARS YARD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	THE LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
Line_5332	E WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DUSCK AND WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT THE PERRIMETER
Line_5333	I USED A YARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DUSCK
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS SWIFF THOSE AND I THINK THEIR STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF IF THEY'RE IS THE RIGHT UM IF THEY THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YEOWLD STICK OR A ROLAR THEY ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVE AND NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETERS
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ENTIMETERS AND THERE ARE TEN DECIMETERS END A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WEE MEASURED THE COMP CAPACITY OF THE CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE COMPACITY
Line_5346	WEE USED ON THE COMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU GET POR UN A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRAGJETATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLLITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLI MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF IN SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT S PR MUCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACCAMPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP OR A WATER BODL OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	THE CUP THE CAMPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE THE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5354	YU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S SHORE IT'S L IT'S THE FOLL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSLES LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND COMPACITY
Line_5357	THE TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHOR IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE COMPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER
Line_5361	COMPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOBBLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT HOW MUCH COM WHAT THE COMPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE COMPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF FORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENT IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLLIUM IN THE COMPACITY THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS A DIFFERENT
Line_5367	THE COMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THE N A OLIUM
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE COMPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VOLIUM OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LITERS AND THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLILITERS
Line_5372	UH TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADGUWATED ILINDER
Line_5373	IT'S LAYBULED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS SO YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM THE ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE IT HELP
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINUT
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING ARE
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY HAVE UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINUTE
Line_5380	I WOULD DISSCRIBE IT ST UP HI AND THEN IT GOES PRITY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIER AND HIR AND HIR
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOWLY MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRASS AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5382	I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T SOLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	ARMS IT WENT FROM TWENTY ALL THE WEIGHT TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DIGREESE AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND LAINGTH AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND A THE OTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO WHEN THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGGER OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDAL AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
Line_5389	TO FIGGER OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	ELL IT SEAS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINEST SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINS SIDE UM SWEAT A LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND THE
Line_5396	UM NO OH
Line_5397	THE WIRES ARE A SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU ARE DRIVING THE COLAGE SORT OF BE LIKE A HIWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK IT DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM A HI WAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM THING I JUST
Line_5400	WOW I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRES COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NOBLE IT'S JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT ARIEA WHERE THE NOASHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	HIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB PURMS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DOES FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SHUR
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BULB ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE N THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	THE WA AT TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOME TIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	ON THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OUT OF THE IRON FIRE LINT STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STEEL LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY IT WOULD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWERE IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND DROT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DEN WAS STICK CALL TIME BUT SOME TIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT SONG TO MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WILE BECAUSE IT CAN STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	OH THAT THE Y HELP JUST INE DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	E OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COM TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THO IT THROUGH THE THIN CART BORD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS STICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FOLE THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WEE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY TO WOULN'T PICK UP ANY UN NOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT JUST RIGHT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COM UP WITH THE
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE EX ELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL ST ST RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT WILL STU GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE SINCE YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAVE THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T ST WORKING
Line_5446	THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	IN THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IS YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINES PLACE AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE ON THE PLUS PLACE SO IT WILL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYSE BECAUSE IT DIPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IN
Line_5450	TO DY I MADE POSTERS PECE POSTURS
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STEEL WITH THE PAPER IN THE MIDDAL AND THE MAGNET BILLOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRYIDED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS UN ON THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENUFF ENERGY AND THE IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONE
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TODY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PIECE HOW IT'S GO TO HAVE PIECE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WORE IS BAD TWO BUT PIECE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE PUT POSTOURS OUT FOR PESCE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS IT THE IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WAS THAT ENERGY WOULDN'T GO FU CHILL THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL THE ELECELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE RONG WAY WHEN YOUR PUTTING IT ON A BATTE THE BAD WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINES
Line_5465	WELL SINCE I CLICKED ON THE BATTERY IT'S GOING TO OPOSIT WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	SEE OR AY BE OR SEE D
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BADERY WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULB CARE
Line_5469	AND A B AND IT AFTER YOU WERE DON WITH TH WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TWO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECONLY WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR THE LAST TIME THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE BE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPIN
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HADD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THAN THE PREVIES PICTUERE WITH ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THIS D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIAGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE IN CLASS
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAS HE PLACE TO GOW
Line_5479	THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL ALL THE BULBS THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	IT HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULBS WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT IS GOING OUT OF ITS NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD GO AND OP IN THE OPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE NO THE FLOW TO S LESST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS ESER BY DROPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPED THEM ON THE RIM CUP OR WE JUST THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A CERTAIN AMOUNT WEIGHED AS THE CALLS
Line_5488	THE WEIGHT BRAKES THE MAGNETIC WAIVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC E
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WAIVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS AND BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURN THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON NOS
Line_5492	I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINES HAS UM THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE POWERFOL ELECTRO MAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT A ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	IT IT BUSED LASED AND IN THE POLARVITS SPUN AWOUND AND CIRCALES
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSE A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARM LIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ERIN IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON AND OFF
Line_5499	Y ENERGY WE FOUND IT E TEN MAKE THE IT MAKE THE MOTOR OR A LIGHT BUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TON ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES M AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULB
Line_5502	UM ONE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UH IT MAKES IT SO THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	UH WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FOLWING IN IT IN THE CIRCLE
Line_5505	WE RUB PA THE CLIP ON A MAGNET AND THEN TRYIDED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP
Line_5507	UM IT WAS CIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN ST PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL W LIKE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH THE MAGNET YOU CAN DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLED US BUT YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES A LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS I I JUST DON'T THINK TO OR I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFOR THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAB S
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FASS TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE TER THE OPOSIT DIRECTION THAT IT WAS ONE THE BATTERY WAS THE OPOSIT WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	BECAUSE IT'S STILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM WHAT DO EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAD IT JUST SWITCH IS THE WEIGH THE THE MOTOR FLAP RUNS
Line_5522	INSTAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT WILL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WA THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCH BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEIGHT TO LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
Line_5525	H DO YOU WANNA DO IT LIKE GO
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS WHAT HEY CALLED IT
Line_5529	WE WHAT TO CO ARE PARAL
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	UM DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLES STILL KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT SAYS NABLE HARD WIRE ESELARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICE THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRA
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERIES THEY YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMER BE FOR BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOLD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS UP THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARAT AND ONE HA I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD TURN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE UM ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WERE TO STOP THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
Line_5548	I THINK ITLD SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNETS
Line_5550	WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOCXS AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS COPPER
Line_5552	AND UM SUM I FORG
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT UM SOMEWARE IN THE CAR BOCKS AND WE TRYD TO FIND IT
Line_5554	WELL WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPRESS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOCXS AND THEN WE CIRTCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	THE POINTING CELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIGHT YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPRESS SO THEN IF THERE IS A METAL OR LIKE A ROCK SOMEWARE IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER A MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TEGNETALLY FINDES UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIN METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WITH MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUB
Line_5561	BY USING LIKE A NAIL OR A NOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOCKXS AND FIND IT TIL ITS FEELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY STICK TO CERTAIN CINDES
Line_5563	IT KIND OF L LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHERE EVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NOW IT DID NOT IT JUST UM KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLAIGHT
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SHORE
Line_5566	THE THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LEVER SIDE THE PENSAL
Line_5567	YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEIR NOT IS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT A STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHERS
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUIGHT SEARE
Line_5571	I THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SHURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MA A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I THINK AND THE
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON IT TOWARDS OFF
Line_5575	IT'S IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAVE TO UM PLA AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UM WHAT Y
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUIGHT SHURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	THE ENERGY UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	U CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	ELL WE PUT IT ON DINER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY APINAN I WOOD I I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE FIG INCH SIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THESE LITTLE SANDBLES AND WE SAW UM AND TE AND JUST SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH WITH THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB AND ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE THE LIGHT BUB THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUIGHT SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	UM THE DRUMS RELAGHT BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WHERE START BUT IT GOES TO WAIT FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	UM IT ALWAISE CUPS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY AND S SAW AND THEN PUT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN PUT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE NE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAISE COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST PUED UP TO THE LITTLE PLAIGHT
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT PHUCKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLB THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL TO THE PLAIGHT
Line_5602	UM WELL AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NIGHT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICE THEY ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT AT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO IS THE ONE IT COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS THE GET THEIR WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS TO BE SIMBLES AND IT THEY'RE ON DISC
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUASCTHERD BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM I NOTQUIGHT
Line_5616	WE NEADE A MAGNET THAT CAN TURN OFF AND UM
Line_5617	UH WEIGH R
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAPES THE UM UM LET THE POWER CO TO THE THE RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MA THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I NOT AT QUIGHT SHURE BUT I THINK IT'S A SPECIAL METAL BUT I'M NOT QUIGHT SHURE
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIDED THAT NOFTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE USED JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT WOULD NOT SHURE IF I'M CORRECT IT'S JUST IN MY OPPANIMAN
Line_5629	WELL IF THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WE UH SO JUST WIT I FORGET
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIDED UM THE WIRES TOUCHING INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPAND
Line_5632	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE AFTER HELP FROM I AND TALL JUST BY RAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM ON ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE MAKE THE LIGHTS TURN ON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FORM EL OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGHT MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	IT MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOU WILL NEEAD MORE YOUR
Line_5641	NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	E YOU CAN STILL MAKE UM A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN PRIDER THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERRY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE WRONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE IN
Line_5648	IN THE WRONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE IN
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I I YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WOULD WALK TO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BOTH UM THE
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRES SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPINING
Line_5657	IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THERE
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE THE SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	SO THE SO MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPNING
Line_5662	UM YES IT IS BECAIS I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMORE TO THIS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAIN
Line_5670	YES WITH OUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORKED WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YE SCIENCE IS VERY QUIL
Line_5674	UM WE'VE SEEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	IPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THEY HAVE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHES GOING INTO A CUP IF IT UN THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEN HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UN HOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	T IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY UH IN THE CUP TO UN HOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING D TACHED FROM EACH OTHER F BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY ARE BEING D TRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT IS HAPINING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PRASS THE ONWASHE THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATE THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GRASS WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YEES IT DAUS TELL US
Line_5686	ASHERS IT TAKES TO MAKE THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHES IT TAKES TO BRAKE THE FORCE
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHES THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO PICK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_5689	I THAT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HUDD THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAS A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT ITS SPONGE
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BATCHERY A BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND WELL WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE CANT THING WE DID IN SCIENCE WHERE WE USED UM THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LE CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
Line_5697	I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT WHATEVER IS UN HEARE IS A SO LIGHT BULB UP
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S IT IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KIND F LIKE A SCREEN RIGHT KNOW
Line_5700	LECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPENING
Line_5704	NOW IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND THE PLASTIC TIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	NAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	AT THE MAGNET CAN GO THREE THINGS THAT I NEVER NOW IT CAN GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE INJOIDE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_5709	UM WE BILT A BOCXE AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEERE WHERE DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT
Line_5710	WHEN THE METTALE SHAVINGS FOUND THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE MAGNETS ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF UH THEN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARD BORD
Line_5713	UM PROBLY MAY BE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	CAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HERE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNET IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT'S STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNET IS THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE ONMINOFF SWITCHH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE IRON UFF SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THERONG PLACE THE MOTOR IT'S NOT GOING TO RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR RAIL RUN
Line_5721	OTOR IF THE MOTOR SURE RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE SO WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DO I DO I FORGOT
Line_5723	IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	U PUT BUL WIRES AT THE BULB OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SINCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCH E UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM YEAH CAUSE WE TRIDE AT A CUPLE TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE IT ELECTRA MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED
Line_5731	UN NO ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	ELL THE MAYWE DID IT IS OUR SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECT UM CONNECTED SO THE ELECTRO MAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRIC
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTRO MAGNET UM IT WILL COM THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	THE ELECTRICITY'S FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	POWER IS GETTING TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	UM THE REASON IT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT STA TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH MA THE ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MINING IN SIENCSE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASELY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWES THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT TO MIX THE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5748	INSULATION MEANS LIKE THE COPER WIRE IS AND SIDE OF THE GREEN CODING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN ON THE SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS THIS STAYS MAGNETICK
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF ANDYES BUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME THE CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND YOU THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB IS N WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I OBSERVED WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN SIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CAN NOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NOH WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISOM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT ON THE N SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LETS GO APARD
Line_5760	WHEN MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WLL UM THAT IT WILL COLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN THEM
Line_5762	ROCK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL ON THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM H IS ALUNIMINIUM ALUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPELLING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING A PART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNETS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	I SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THEN NINTEEN WASHERS BROK THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TWO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY PROPERLY SEPARATED QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACES AND BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FORCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE PULLED THEM SELES BECAUSE OF THE SPACES TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU GET A HIR NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS AND YOU GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WELL REPEL THEM SELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
Line_5776	YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND DOWN YOU SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION SAND BE CREATIVE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF THAT ELECTRICITY D TURN ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THERE ARE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR A LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	UM I FORGET IT'S NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN ES AND IT USES SIMBLES TO TELL UM INSTEAD OF JUST DROWING ALL THE D CALLS
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	IT SHOWES YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NO WIRES
Line_5785	YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT'S THAT IS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TO DAY WE DID THIS FUN MISTER THING WITH A FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	FOR NO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BE
Line_5788	HI MY NAME IS ONE
Line_5789	TIME OUR NAME IS ONE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FO WEAKS
Line_5790	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISOM AND SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORK
Line_5791	WELL THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO ROD ON AH AND THE AND THE ONE ON D
Line_5792	WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECT KEEPS THE IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRALBS THAT THE WIRES ATTACHED TO OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
Line_5794	WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORK
Line_5795	UM THE CONDUCTORS
Line_5796	WELL GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UM WORK
Line_5797	WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTRACTED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MISTERY BORD BY A WIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
Line_5798	WELL THAT SO THAT UM THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MISTRY BOB ARE CONNECTED FROM AND SEE
Line_5799	WELL A CIRCUIT IS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S UM MAKING SOMETHING WORK
Line_5800	UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU JUST AS ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
Line_5801	UM THE BAT OM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF A D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5802	UM WELL JUST M MORE WY ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIKE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5803	I UM UM NOT SHURE
Line_5804	I THINK THAT SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5805	UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLUS BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINES SIDE TO THE BATTERY
Line_5806	WELL WELL IT'S ALWASE COMING IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE INTO THE BA INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINES SIDE
Line_5807	WELL IT ALWASE COMES IN THROUGH THE PLAS SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5808	IT UM IT ALWASE FLOWS OUT THE MINES SIDE AND ALWAISE COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5809	WELL IT ALWASE FLOWS AWAY FROM THE PLAS SIDE SO YEAH
Line_5810	WELL IF THE CUP IF IT'S TWO HEAVY AND THE CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THEN IT'LL BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_5811	IF WE HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER AND OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
Line_5812	WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FORCE IS PREY STRONG
Line_5813	WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAK THE FORCE
Line_5814	THEY'RE GETTING SPREAD APART
Line_5815	THE DISTANCE INCREASES
Line_5816	THE MAGNETIC FORCE SLOWLY WEAKENS UNTOL IT'S NOT MAGNET UNTO IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5817	WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TO SPACES AIAMHURE
Line_5818	GROUP D THEY ALL PROPERTY MUCH THE SAME IS OR EXCEPT GROUPS SEE JUST GOYING TO THROUGH THEIR WASHERS IN AND BAD OR
Line_5819	WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5820	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING UH THIS CIRCUIT IS ONE BATTERY AND POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS OUT AT ONES
Line_5821	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5822	AND OH YEAH
Line_5823	WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAS ONE
Line_5824	EACH EACH M LIGHT BULB HAS ITS ON PATHWAY
Line_5825	YEAH EACH COMPONENT HAS THEIR ON PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE OR THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5826	WELL THE BULB AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5827	WELL UM THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5828	WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS ON UH PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5829	TWO PATHWAYS I THINK
Line_5830	THIS RES A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5831	IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5832	THAT UM THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE POWER
Line_5833	WELL THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEWARE IN THE BOCX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
Line_5834	UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S PROPALY A MAGNET IN IT
Line_5835	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAY IT'S GOING
Line_5836	WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISOM IS LIKE WHAT THE FIL LEGS ARE GETING PULLED TO
Line_5837	OH I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM QUARTER
Line_5838	HE PAPER CLIP FLYS TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUSHING IS PULLING IT IN
Line_5839	UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPIDING AROUND BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
Line_5840	WELL WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE MAGNET IT 'LL START PORING HARD AND HEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING IT SO THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THE MAGNET
Line_5841	WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WORK LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5842	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAPERROUND THE CORD THE UM THE STRONGER THE ELECTRIC UM MAGNET WILL BE
Line_5843	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5844	THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_5845	WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AND IRON CORD IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP UM LIKE WASHERS
Line_5846	UM WELL UM NOT SHURE
Line_5847	THE UM CHUOR WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE WASHERS
Line_5848	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
Line_5849	WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW SO THE UM THE CIRCUIT THAT IN THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5850	WELL IF THE CSWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT WILL PICK UP WASHERS
Line_5851	IF THE UM UM SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
Line_5852	THE CSWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET WORKS
Line_5853	WELL THE CORD MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO PULL THE WASHERS AWAY
Line_5854	THE WIRES ARE RAPPED ABOUND IT AND IT IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5855	UM I'M NOT SHURE
Line_5856	WELL WE HAD A ADD A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE A AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_5857	WELL YOU HAVE TO USE IT UM THE D CELL TO GET THE ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5858	I PERTY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN SPIN ER ONTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_5859	I THINK THE REASON IT'S UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IS BECAUSE THAT'S A SOURCE SHE USED TO PA A LIGHT BULB
Line_5860	WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GIDE IT THE THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GIDES IT THROUGH
Line_5861	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULB LIGHT
Line_5862	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUN INTO THE WIRES
Line_5863	ELEC ELECTRICITY
Line_5864	I MEASURE RE CONDUCT FOLSAR
Line_5865	UM YOU CONNECTED HIM TO EACH CONTACT FROM AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
Line_5866	WELL WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THIS SIDE
Line_5867	UM I'M NOT SHORE
Line_5868	WELL A D CELL GIVES THE UM GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
Line_5869	E WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
Line_5870	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING WE'RE SO IT NEED TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
Line_5871	UM THE CIRCUIT UM UM IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STURES UP AGAIN
Line_5872	WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PARK WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE FLAG SO THE FLAG SPINING AROUND
Line_5873	THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIT AROUND
Line_5874	IT'S MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_5875	UM IT REPERSENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GOING WITH IT
Line_5876	LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING A TACT THE CONTACT POINT SO GETTING IN IT
Line_5877	UM THERE IS A MOTOR AT THE UM
Line_5878	IT HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED ABOUT THE CORD
Line_5879	WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE QHOR MORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BATTERIES IN
Line_5880	UM THAT'S SHOWING THAT IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED WINES IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5881	ONE HUNDRED MY WINES MEANS THAT TO PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5882	WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5883	UM IF YOU UN IF IT'S NOT IS WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
Line_5884	THE MORE WINES YOU HAVE AND MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5885	WELL THE MORE WRAP YOU DO AROUND THE CORS AND MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5886	WELL THE UM THE MORE WIS YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT WILL PICK UP
Line_5887	WELL ONE WEITE STRENGTH IN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINDS AROUND THE MOR TIMES
Line_5888	UH YOU COULD WRAP IT ABOUND MORE TIMES
Line_5889	UM SOME OF THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY
Line_5890	UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST IN KEEPS INCREASING AND THE MORE WASHERS YOU UM I MEAN THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT
Line_5891	BECAUSE THE MORE UM IT'S TOUCH OREIT'S CLOSE TO ELECTRICITY'S THE BIGGER THE ELECT UM THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS
Line_5892	IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD BIGER
Line_5893	WELL UM THE MORE UM WIRE RAP YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THEM MORE UH WASHERS
Line_5894	WELL IT'S SHOING UH LIKE THE MORE UH WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5895	WELL THE MORE WRAPS ARE YOU TO THE HIRES THE GRA GET UM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WASHERS ARE
Line_5896	UM THE FARTHER YOU'LL RIGHT IT INCREASES TEN RAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIER
Line_5897	WELL WHEN THE NUMBER WRAPS GET LARGER THE THE WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP
Line_5898	THEIRE ARE INCREASING UM HOW MUCH YOU HA UM PICK UP
Line_5899	WELL THE MORE WATER WRAPS YOU GET THAT MORE WASHES WASHERS SHALL PICK UP
Line_5900	WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THE WHEN IT'S NOT A STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
Line_5901	IT MEANS IT STRONGER
Line_5902	BECAUSE UH NINTY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE BOTH FIFTEEN RAMS
Line_5903	WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORCE IT DIPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCTOR IT IS
Line_5904	AN OPENS WA AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_5905	WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKE IT SPIN
Line_5906	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK

Line_5948	THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5949	WELL IN THIS SCRIMATTRICK THERE ARE TWO O BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5950	THE PARALLEL VERICAL LINES UH REPRESENT BATTERIES
Line_5951	UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COAL
Line_5952	IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
Line_5953	WELL AND THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE POLE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5954	WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC POLE BECOMES WEAKER
Line_5955	WELL THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT RIGH
Line_5956	NICE STICK UNTO YOU TO BYE
Line_5957	GOOD HOW HOW ARE YOU
Line_5958	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING IN ELECTRICITY
Line_5959	I THINK YOU'VE MADE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5960	WELL WHEN YOU'RE ALL OVER THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES UM GLOWY GREEN
Line_5961	THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYSE FLOWS FROM THE MINEST SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5962	IT GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PAUSE OR POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5963	EACH SIMBLE REPROENTES A LIGHT BULB OF THAT
Line_5964	RE TO PARALLEL CIRCUIT BASICLY
Line_5965	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AS I HAVE SAD BEFORE
Line_5966	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MEANS THE RECEIVERS EACH HAVE A SEPERET PATHWAY TO THE BATTERY
Line_5967	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH RECEIVER
Line_5968	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5969	THERE IS A MAGNET IN SIDE THE MISTERY BOCK SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S SO MSTERIES
Line_5970	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO IRON
Line_5971	I CAN WELL THINK OF MUCH AND AND ANSWER OF AN ANSWER
Line_5972	GREAT HOWER UH AS YOUR SELF
Line_5973	WE'VE BEEN MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5974	E LOOK TRECITY
Line_5975	BECAUSE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THERE IS MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5976	YEA TWISTED AROUND UH CARE
Line_5977	WELL IF YOU RAP THE CORD WITH WIRE A MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED
Line_5978	WELL THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CONNECTING THE TWO WIRE CLIPS

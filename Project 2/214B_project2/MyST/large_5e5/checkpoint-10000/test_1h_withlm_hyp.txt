Line_0	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CITUMS AND ABOUT THE BODIES A CITUM A SCACIS ISTUM AND THE ERTHIICIS
Line_1	A CAUSE SUCITCE THE ERTH A HUMAN BODY
Line_2	IT CARE A SISTOM WITH THE MANY PARTS LIKE THE WEL
Line_3	THE CAR HAS PARTS LIKE THE
Line_4	THE MANY PARTS IT HAS
Line_5	BEL THAT HELPS IT WON'T
Line_6	HUMAN BODY IS ALL SOURCE
Line_7	IT SHOES ME PART PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND WHAT MAKES IT A IS
Line_8	ELL ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE HURT CONNECTS TWO AND THE BLUDY VESSL
Line_9	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKES IT A SIT
Line_10	THE ERTH IS ALSO I
Line_11	IT HAS UNIT ALSO HAS WATER AND IT HAS THE FOR STEEL
Line_12	YES BECAUSE ERTH HAS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE UP
Line_13	WELL THE TREES ARE A PART TEHE
Line_14	SAND AND PLACES LIKE
Line_15	THE BES HERE IS PART OF ERTH AND ERTH IS A NEGO CISTALE
Line_16	THIS MIXTURE SHOES ME A MAYBE A FOR AND LIKCFF
Line_17	WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS GET EEN BY AND ANNIMLS ARE PART OF THE SH
Line_18	A PIN TREE AND PRODUCES IT'S FOD
Line_19	ABOUT D COMPOSORS CONSUMERS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE STUFF LIKE LIKE PRODUCE
Line_20	THIS SHOES THE CONSUMEARES PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSIURS
Line_21	IT COMPOSES CONCRETE AND PRODUCERS
Line_22	WHEN THEY EAT THE FOUD THE ANIMLES GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_23	BECOUNCUMERS EAT OTHER ANIMLES AND CONSUMERS CAN GET EVEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_24	IT CONSUMER THAT EATCH AND OTHER ANIMAL OR A CONSUMER THAT THE ANIML GET TO EN BYE MAYBE
Line_25	THE RAT WELL THEY BOTH KIND OF EAT LIKE PLANTS AND THEY BOTH GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMLMS
Line_26	THEY ARE BOTH ANIMLES RIGHT
Line_27	THESE EACH MIL
Line_28	MEAT AND LIKE VECHTABL
Line_29	THIS FOCX IS PROBABLY A CARNE
Line_30	THE MOUSE IS A VEJTERAN
Line_31	ONE IS A D COMPOSER
Line_32	CAN YOU PLEASE NAME ALL FOR
Line_33	RED WORMS ET DECAINE METAL
Line_34	THEY ARE TOMPING ON THE PAPER AND LEAVES AND TURNING IT INTO THE THAT MEANS THEY ARE COMPOSING
Line_35	IT TURNS INTO DIRT OR SO
Line_36	THE WAIST IS THE WORMS FOD
Line_37	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT AT THE GROPS OF PLANTS
Line_38	SOMETHING WITH GROW
Line_39	GA THEN ME A
Line_40	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ANSO IT MOVE THEM
Line_41	IT'S SOMETHING METALS DON'T
Line_42	THAT S ALL SO AND NOT IT S TO IT'S LIKE GONNAVE BEEN
Line_43	E
Line_44	LEVER HO AE AND DIRECT OR SOILE
Line_45	YES IT YEAH
Line_46	IT'S CLOUD BLESING IT IS PONCETIVEY

Line_48	TE
Line_49	I'M SEEN THAT H WE GARDEN
Line_50	YES OH MOST YOU CAN SAY UM BELVID
Line_51	IT I CAN BE A UM BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GET IT'S FOOD IT COULD PROBABLY MAKE DIE
Line_52	A HOUSNDRED
Line_53	IT NEEDS A SAFE PLACE TO REST
Line_54	NO BECAUSE PLANTS ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WILL NOT HAVE SALTER BUT THEY MOST LIKE DO MET ITS
Line_55	PLEASE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_56	BY THEIR BLUD CELLS AND THEY'RE LEAVES
Line_57	THE FOOD THEY BULB THEY PRODUCE THEIR ON FOD TO THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN AND THE ENERGY
Line_58	IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY OF THE STUFF W THEN IT IT'S GARANTYE IN A DASH
Line_59	PRODUCING THE ENERGY FROM THE SIN
Line_60	IT'S IN IT'S
Line_61	IT'S NOT GETTING THE RIGHT MATERIAL THAT IT NEADS TO LIVES
Line_62	IT MEANS IT'S GETTING NO FOD AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY FOOD IT'S NOT THEN THE LIVE
Line_63	IT'S DYING EVEN MOREARE AND IT LOOKS LIKE CRUSTY
Line_64	IT'S ALSO NOT IN WHEN LIKE IT ALSO MS
Line_65	HAS NOT ONE OF THEM DES OF MATERIALS I DON'T USE AND IF IT DOEN'T GET THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO PROCEED AND WIVE IT'S LIGHT
Line_66	IT DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH AS IT MEANS WITH WATER
Line_67	IT DIDN'T H WEN IT OR SUN RIGHT
Line_68	THEN THAT MEANS IT'S GETTING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT IT MEANS
Line_69	THAT FOO WEBS ARE IMPORTANT TO LIGHT
Line_70	THAT GLAMS ARE BEEN
Line_71	IT STARTS WITH THE D COMPOSERS THEN TO THE PRODUCERS THEN TO THE CONSUMERS
Line_72	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT F PLANTS LIVING THINGS AND HOW PLANTS NEAD AIR SUN AND WATER
Line_73	THAT'S IS MO
Line_74	WEIGHED A SECUINT IT'S TH RIGHT TOO SO SO CLOSED WE GO AND THEN TWO

Line_137	I THINK IT EXPARON VERY MANY PARTS END THAT'S MOVING AND MAKING THE ENTIR CAR WORK
Line_138	I THINK IT'S LIKE A SUB IT AND THE CISTUM IS A METAL SISTUM THAT MAKES UP A BIG SISTOM
Line_139	I THINK IT'S A SISSTOM BECAUSE THERE'S UN OF DIFFERENT THINGS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MOVE AND STOP
Line_140	IT SHOWS UM HOW THAT'S ONE THING HELPS YOUR BODY

Line_156	ANTRENTS FROM THE SOIL
Line_157	I THINK PLANTS NEED THE SUN
Line_158	NO I DON'T THINK IT REALLY WOOD
Line_159	PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FEED THEM
Line_160	I THINK THAT'S TOMADDAOW USE
Line_161	I DON'T THINK THEY NEED IT BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR ALL FOD
Line_162	YES I DO NEAD THAT
Line_163	UM THE SUN MAKES IT LOOK GREEN AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY SUN THEN IT WON'T BE GREEN
Line_164	IT'S NOT ADDING ENOUFH AIR SO IT'S GOING TO SHRIBL UP AND DIVE
Line_165	THEY HAS ALL THE SUCINTIESE TO GROW
Line_166	IT'S MISE AND HELTHY AND IT T'S FREE TO GROW
Line_167	IT'S WHAT EATS W AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_168	PRODUCERS ARE USUALLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FODWAB WHICH MEANS THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF THAT EATS IT
Line_169	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE VASCULAR SISTUM AND PLANTS AND VASCULAR MEAN SPAINS
Line_170	SOME LEAVES ARE UH DIFFERENT PLANTS AND SOME AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THEIR RAINS TO BE GOING
Line_171	AN PALM MAY AND PARALLELW
Line_172	WELL WE HAVE MAINS OR ANIMLS
Line_173	THE BASCIULAR SISTMIT IT CARRIES ALL THE FOD AND NO TRANS OR
Line_174	I THINK IT COMES FROM THE LEAF BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES
Line_175	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAIN BODDY AND THE RECSPTORIES ST
Line_176	IT WARNS ANIMLES TO STAY AWAY OR THEY CAN BE SPRADED
Line_177	THE RAY DOESN'T WANT TO GO ANYWERE NEARE THE SUCH ITS TAIL IS UP AND THAT MEANS IT MIGHT SPRING

Line_187	ALL OF IT'S SUB ISTUMS THEM IT
Line_188	SISTUM IT'S A SITUM
Line_189	IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND MAYBE HARD TO UNDERSTAN

Line_428	IT HELPS YOU SWALLOW DOWN THE FOD AND YEAH
Line_429	THAT'S WHERE ARI FOOD GOES
Line_430	THEY ALSO HELP USE DI JESTRI FOUD
Line_431	ABOUT LIKE THE DIFFERENT TIPES OF LEIVES AND LIKE THE DIFFERENT NAMES AND ABOUT THE ROUTS AND THE LEIVES
Line_432	THAT THERE IS A PINE A PALE MAY AND A PARALLEL
Line_433	ALL THE ROUTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEIR SHAPE IS DIFFERENT
Line_434	THERE IS THREE KINDS OF VAIN THERE IS POLL MA PIRONA AND PARALLEL

Line_439	BECAUSE IF YOU COULD TO BREATHE YOU WON TO BE ALIVE AND HUNDRED
Line_440	THAT THIS IS LIKE HOW IT GOES THROUGH
Line_441	IT GETS SEPARATING FOR ANY HUMAN
Line_442	THEY HELP YOU LIKE PUMP AIR OUT OF YOUR SISTUM AND THEN BACK AN
Line_443	THAT LIKE IT'S LIKE THE LONG BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING YOU PUMP AIR AND PUMP IT OUT
Line_444	BROM C BONCLES
Line_445	UN HELPING PUMP THE AIR ANDIER LONGS AND HOW
Line_446	THEY IT GETS RED OF ALL OF THE BADD AIR
Line_447	M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_448	ABOUT LIKE UM LIKE LUMS AND HOW WE BREEATH
Line_449	IT WE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW ANIMALS LIKE USE ATTRACTIONS TO CALL MASS OR SENCE DANGER
Line_450	THAT THEY ALL CALL FOR MATES AND SENCE DANGSUR AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW AND THEY TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM PRATERS AND YEAH
Line_451	WELL THE SCONK WILL USE ITS SMELL BECAUSE IT STINKS LIKE REALLY BAT IT WILL USE ITS SMELL TO MAKE PROMETERS GO AWAY
Line_452	IT IS LIKE ONE OF IT'S ADDEPTACIONS IS THAT IT BLUNS IN WITH THE SAN SO IF ONE OF IT'S TEARS COME BY IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
Line_453	WELL IT LIKE COULD BLEND INTO THE CORAL
Line_454	THE THAT FEET HAS LITTLE TINDY LITTALE LITTLE FEET
Line_455	BECAUSE IT AS LIKE THE RIGHT KIND OF WEB KIND OF AND LIKE IT IT'S REALLY LIKE IT HELPS IT SH
Line_456	NUMBER TODAS BECAUSE THEY'RE AN IN TEETH AND THEY'RE REALLY SHARP AND HELPS THEM LIKE HO IT UP
Line_457	I THINK THAT IT'S UM WAINGS DO SO IT COULD FLY AWAY
Line_458	BECAUSE LIKE THEIR SHOW BRIGHT AND THEY HAVE THER WINGS THAT CAN HELP IT FLIYE AWAY FROM PRODETERS
Line_459	WELL SHE'S LIKE LIKE THE SNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL WITH HIS RATTAL
Line_460	WELL SO THE HUMAN DOESN'T GET HER HE IS JUST GIVING HER A SIMPLE WORM
Line_461	WELL THE SNAKE IS THE STINUWISS AND THE GIRL IS THE REACTION
Line_462	WELL THE THE SCONK IS LIKE MAKING HIS SMELL SO THE KIOTY WILL GO AWAY FROM
Line_463	THAT HIS SMELL IS LIKE SANK SMELL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY
Line_464	IT COULD HAVE A REALLY WEARED ACTION
Line_465	I'S ABOUT STIMULASS AND IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ACTUALLY LIKE REACTION AND STUFF
Line_466	THAT TIL SHOW A STIMULASS AND AND REACTION I RE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_467	THEY ARE LIKE MOVING SOMEWARE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET COLD ON WHERE THEY ARE UH WHERE THEY ARE
Line_468	INSTINGTUWAL BE HAVIUR
Line_469	WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THEIR SEEING LIKE WAY AL I JUST GOT THAT ON SPECKER OMGASH
Line_470	NO IT ISN'T A LEARN BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A REACTION
Line_471	YES YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT INSTINGTIVE IT'S A LEARNING THING
Line_472	WE'VE BEEN DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
Line_473	SALAD IS MIXED WITH VECHTABLES
Line_474	THEY ARE MIXED WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_475	THE ONE ONE THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT
Line_476	IT TAKES BETTER WHEN IT'S MIXED
Line_477	THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_478	THE MARBLES ARE STUCK IN THE THING AND THE WATER AND THE BULB
Line_479	FOR THE SCREEN THE SAND FALLS ON THE SCREEN SO THEN THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
Line_480	THE SAND IS NOT GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_481	UM IT I CAN'T FORGOT I'M SORY
Line_482	THE SALT EVAPORATES OR OR DISSOLVE
Line_483	UM MAYBE I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_484	EVEN THO THE SALT EVAPORATES THE WATER STILL ST AS SALT WATER
Line_485	IT'S TURNING INTO A MIXTURE BUT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IF IT WOULD HAVE SAND IN IT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO THE WATER AND THE SCREE
Line_486	SALT OR THE SOLUTION
Line_487	YES YOU COULD PUT THE GRAM SE BACK IN THE CAN BUT UM THE WATER WOULD THE GRAM WOULD BE PURIFIDED WITH WATER
Line_488	THEUH
Line_489	THERE IS MOD MADE FROM SAND AND WATER
Line_490	E I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNHALESED SOME IN
Line_491	IT DISSOLVES
Line_492	I LIKE TOCKERS
Line_493	WHAT IS A SINCE D NO A SINCE IS SO PLEASE MA WAS A SIDE FROM OKAY
Line_494	WHAT IS A SILUNTE
Line_495	WHAT IS A SITE
Line_496	SALT SALTSALTAROMYIKE
Line_497	TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU A REAL PERSON OR IT'S JUST LIKE AN ANIMATED RO
Line_498	UM THE SOLUTION
Line_499	WHEN YOU PLEASE ANSWER ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_500	REPEAT THAT
Line_501	IT IS PERFECTLY BALANCED
Line_502	WE HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE CLUSS BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT
Line_503	UM OF A MIXTURE INSOLUTION SO PROPER
Line_504	WE HAVE NOT LEARNED B SENT MEANS E SO PLEASE TELL ME WA A SIT MEANSYOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT UP FROM ME PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A SEE IS
Line_505	IT MEANS IT IT CREATES SOLUTION AT THE END BECAUSE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SALT INTO THE CUP
Line_506	A SOLUTION
Line_507	A MIXTURE A MIXTURE A MIXTURE
Line_508	IT'S A MIXTURE NOW BUT THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH SO IT DOESN'T CREA A SOLUTION
Line_509	IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_510	A SOLUTION
Line_511	A MIXTURE
Line_512	I DON'T KNOW
Line_513	IT IS CREATING A MIXTURE
Line_514	THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
Line_515	UM IT IS UM WE TURN TO CRYSTALS LIKE SALT CRYSTALS I THINK SO THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_516	CREATE A MIXTURE
Line_517	UM THE PERSON WAS MIXING IT UP
Line_518	UM I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
Line_519	UM I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TIME IT TAKES TIME FOR TO EVAPORATE
Line_520	UM TO DAY WE TOOK THE SALT CRYSTALS MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_521	BYE
Line_522	MIXTURES
Line_523	SOLUTIONS
Line_524	USING A SCREEN AND OR A MAGNET OR A FUNNEL
Line_525	WHAT DID YOU STUDY MONNEAMES
Line_526	WHAT DO YOU SIGN MOMMY
Line_527	WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT THE MIXTURES MARNEY
Line_528	I THINK THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF THIS MIXTURE IS MASS
Line_529	IT IS A MAGNET IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_530	IT WON'T ASK YOU A QUESTION MARNEY
Line_531	LOOKS LIKE THE SAME EXAMPLE TO ME THE SOL SAMES LIKE ARE
Line_532	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES ARE TYPE OF GASSES SOME ARE SOLIDS AND SOME ARE LIQUIDS
Line_533	UM I THINK IT'S THE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THOSE HAVE METAL IN IT AND MAGNETS ATTRACTING METAL
Line_534	MARNEY WHAT IS UHM ITS
Line_535	UM I THINK IT COULD BE SALT
Line_536	UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS PLEASE SOMETHING WHAT THE FEETS
Line_537	A SOLUTION
Line_538	UM BYE TALKING TOAR
Line_539	NOT GOOD NOT GOOD UM NOT DOING WELL TODAY
Line_540	MMM WE UM WHAT ARE WE DO IN SCIENCE
Line_541	IF THAT MOLB ON THE RIGHT CUP I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ELECTUALLY GROWS
Line_542	I'M JUST JUST SAING IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A WRONK
Line_543	THE ROCK WEIGHS EATY TWO MORE I MEAN TO IN THE ROCK WEIGHS UM A EIGHT MORE GRAMS THAN THE TER
Line_544	WHAT IS WHAT IS A SOLUT
Line_545	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHS HEAVIER
Line_546	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_547	UH MOST CONCENTRATED IS SOLUTION TWO
Line_548	UM THE ONE LOOKS LIKE THE ONE TO
Line_549	THE MOST DILUTED LOOKS LIKE A SOLUTION THREE
Line_550	UH GOOD BYE WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN
Line_551	NOT GOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_552	I DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WAKE ONEDAY AND LAST TIME WE N SCIENCE WAS EITHER ON FRIDAY OR THIRSTY SO I CANT REMEMBER
Line_553	IT LOOKS LIKE A CORK FLOWING ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND THE PANY HAS SUNK TO THE WATER AND THE WATER
Line_554	UH THEY FLOW AND SOME DON'T FLOW
Line_555	ONLY D TOTALLY D
Line_556	A SOLUTION B HAS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS IT UP LIKE SALT BECAUSE SALT CAN KEEP THINGS UP
Line_557	UM YEAH I SA I AGREE
Line_558	IT'S IT'S UM
Line_559	IT BECOMES FIFTY YEAH BECOMES A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AW
Line_560	UM THE BLUE ONE IS MORE DENSE SO IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE YELLOW LIQUID
Line_561	UM IT'S A VERY CONCENTRATE
Line_562	IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS OF SALT
Line_563	THE BLUE ONE HAS THE MOSEGRAMS AND THAT MAKES IT MORE DON
Line_564	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE DENSE AND ONE IS LESS E O LESS SENSE ONE IS THE CHAIN AND THE MORE DENSE ONE IS
Line_565	HI HOW YOUR DOING TODAY
Line_566	UH IT'S ABOUT SALT AND WATER
Line_567	IT YEAH BYE
Line_568	I NOTICE THAT IT'S GETING MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIM
Line_569	HUM SO IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRARY NO BECAUSE IT'S THREE SCOOPED OFF
Line_570	IS SO THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN
Line_571	IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIME
Line_572	UM I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_573	YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER MEY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ME AND I ON TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SO
Line_574	I TAME A A CENTIMLNTA CONDREATED
Line_575	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT WOULD BE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS AN THE WASHER
Line_576	THE ONE IN THE MIDDALE WOULD BE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_577	UH THE ONE IN THE MIDDAL IS THE MOST THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS INSIDE OF E
Line_578	UM I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ONE THEMS O
Line_579	UM IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUBSANCE TO IS THE MOST CONSTANT
Line_580	THE ONE ON THE METAL SOME TWO IS THE MOST
Line_581	UH IT TALKS LIKE S
Line_582	UH EPSON THRE
Line_583	UM THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES AND DIFFERENT UM UH DIFFERENTES LIKE LIKE UM YOU CAN DISCRIBE THEM DIFFERN
Line_584	UM THEY HAVE DIFFERENT
Line_585	I WOULD BE AM EPSOM SALT
Line_586	WAS BE EPSOM SALT IT MUST BE
Line_587	WE DED A SCIENCE A A CUPLE DAYSE AGO SO I FORI FORGOT UM
Line_588	WHEY'RE MAKING MIC REACTION AND MAKING IT IT'S SBLE IT FLOWED
Line_589	A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_590	UH IT'S THE PRODUCT
Line_591	UM REPEAT
Line_592	UM I THINK THE BEST ONE WOULD BE THE CALCIOM COR AND B
Line_593	UM ANDYBEREG
Line_594	UM IT BECOMES THE PRODUCT
Line_595	IT BOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CEMICALS IN IT
Line_596	UM THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT UM
Line_597	THE AMOUNT MOLECUMES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_598	UH I I DON'T KNOW
Line_599	UM THEY WILL COLLECT THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECLUE
Line_600	MIX A PRODUCT OR A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_601	UM THERE ARE EMICALS CALLED BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLOR
Line_602	OMLY IT BUBBLES UP
Line_603	THE REC T GOES TO THE BOTM
Line_604	THE SODIUM DR SAID DISSOLVES
Line_605	THEY ARE DIFFERENT TIYPES OF MOLECULES AND ALL
Line_606	UM IT JUST DISSOLVES
Line_607	UM IT DISSOLVES LIKE OUR HEEP
Line_608	UM I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME AFTER THE CMICALS ARE PUT IN SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN
Line_609	UH IT MADE BUBBLE
Line_610	UH UM I DON'T THINK THE TMICALS WATER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WOULD BE WATER ON THE OUT SID
Line_611	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAY A NO CA
Line_612	OR SOMEONE IS DUMPING WATER INTO A GLASS
Line_613	UM IT MAKES
Line_614	THERE IS ACUMICAL REACTION A CORN
Line_615	ER CAUSES UM RUST O
Line_616	IF THE TOBWHITH GREEN LIQUID MADE THE WATER TONGRE
Line_617	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE BENDING THE GLOW STICK AND THAT'S ALL
Line_618	UM THERE S COM REACTION TAKING PLACE
Line_619	UH YEAH TOTALLY
Line_620	UH I WANT TO SEE THAT VI
Line_621	UH YOU'RE ADDING THE GRAPS OF TASTIC INTO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT BE DIFFERENT TO
Line_622	ES THER IS
Line_623	TO THEY LEARNED ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTION HOW THEY MIXED TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_624	UM DOING WELL TODY VARY GOOD
Line_625	UH IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SAY IMPORTANT YOU MEAN PORING TO THE ERTH OR LIKE TO THE EXPERIMENT
Line_626	I NOTICE THAT IT UM BLUE UP SO I THINK IT MADE OCRAGION
Line_627	I THINK THOSE CMICALS ARE CREATED CREATING OCXEAG AND HAERG BUT POINT SIG AM
Line_628	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_629	IT LOOKS LIKE UM IT GETS HEAVIER WHEN YOU'LL UM ADD MORE CHEMICALS
Line_630	UH TWENTY FIVE PU THIRTY FIVE BEES SIXTY AND SIXTY GRAMS
Line_631	UM I THINK WEIT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_632	THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO EACH OTHER
Line_633	I S MA THE S I AGREED WITH YOU OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I'M DOING GOOD
Line_635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_636	THEY ARE ALL TWO OR MORE THINGS THAT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_637	SOME ARE FOOD AND SOME ARE OTHER ITOMS
Line_638	HALF OF THEM ARE FOD AND HALF OF THEM ARE OTHER MIXTURES
Line_639	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THE ONE ON RIGHT ARE A BUNCH OF SEPARATE IDROMS
Line_640	IT IS A MIXTURE AND WHEN YOU DO IT IT WILL MAKE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
Line_641	I WOULD CALL THESE MIXTURES
Line_642	IT GETS SORTED OUT INTO THREE DIFFERENT ITOMS AND THEN IT IS NOT A MIXTURE
Line_643	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED AND NOW ARE NOT A MIXTURE THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT MS
Line_644	THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARAED
Line_645	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND CREATED A SOLUTION
Line_646	I DON'T KNOW
Line_647	A SOLUTION
Line_648	MARNEY I CAN SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_649	MARNEY AI CANT SEE THE VIDEO
Line_650	NO MARNEY I DON'T KNOW THEM
Line_651	MARNEY I CANT SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_652	A SOLUTE
Line_653	THAT NOTHING EVAPORATES OR DISAPPEARS
Line_654	THAT NOFTHING DISAPPEARES OR EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR
Line_655	BY EVAPORATING THE LIQUID AND JUST LEAVING THE SOLID
Line_656	ONE HAD A MIXTURE NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_657	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER ALL THE WAY SO IT WAS ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
Line_658	THIS MEANS THAT THE WATER AND THE SALT ARE THE SOLUTE ARE A SOLUTION
Line_659	THAT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE NOT A SOLUTION
Line_660	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER MEANING THAT IT WAS A SOLUTION
Line_661	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE LIQUID TO E TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_662	IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE AND LEAVE THE SALT B
Line_663	GOOD BYE MARNEY
Line_664	I'M DOING EXULANT AND NOPRASLY LAST Y
Line_665	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_666	YOU CAN SORT IT OUT WITH YOUR HAN
Line_667	YOU CAN USE A FUNNEL OR A SCREEN
Line_668	THERE IS A DRY MIXTURE AND A MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF IT
Line_669	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE ROCKS AND THE WATER
Line_670	WHAT'S A SEED
Line_671	THE ROCKS ARE GETING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND I THINK THE SAND
Line_672	THE MAGNET PULLED THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_673	A SEE AND A MAGNET
Line_674	BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS AND THE WATER SO A SE CATCH THE ROCK ON TOP WHILL THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_675	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE METAL IN THEM AND SOME MIXTURES HAVE BIG OBJECTS AND SMALL OBJECTS IN THEM
Line_676	BECAUSE THE MAGNET WOULD GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT AND LEAVE THE REST IN THERE
Line_677	I NOTICE THAT ONLY THE ROCKS WENT THROUGH THE SEE NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO SMALL
Line_678	UNK WE USED FILTER BECAUSE IT'S HOLES ARE BIG ENOUGH THAT WATERS CAN GO THROUGH BUT SMALL ENOUGH THAT SAND CAN NOT
Line_679	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU WHENEVER I SEE YOU ASOM FLIGHT THE NEXT TIME WE DO AN EX SCIENCE EXPERIMENT TO TOGETHER
Line_680	A SOLEUTACION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_681	I THINK IT'S CALLED SOMETHING LIKE A STATION OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_682	BECAUSE ITW'LL ITHER BE DARKER OR LIGHTER
Line_683	ONE ONLY HAS TWO PURPLE CRYSTAL SHARDS AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTAL SHARDS
Line_684	ONE OF THEM HAS TWO CRYSTALS OF POWDER AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTALS OF POWDER
Line_685	IN THE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE MORE DILUTE THE LIGHTER AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED THE DARKER
Line_686	THERE IS MORE GRA INK POWDER AND THE DARKER ONE AND LESS GRA DRINK POWDER AND THE W
Line_687	WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SOLUTION BY ADDING WATER TO IT
Line_688	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER OR NOT PUT AS MUCH WATER INTO STEEN
Line_689	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER
Line_690	YOU CAN WEIGH EACH OF THEM IF YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AND SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE AND THAT ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_691	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE THAN TWO AND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE TWO WEIGH MORE THAN ONE
Line_692	BY MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME YOU DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
Line_693	IT WILL FLOW
Line_694	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOW BECAUSE THEY'RE LESS DENSE ALSO
Line_695	THE ONE THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW AND THE ONE THAT IS MORE DENSE WILL SINK
Line_696	THE ONE THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED WIL SHINKAND THE ONE THAT IS LESS CONCENTRATED WILL FLOW
Line_697	IT WILL FLOW INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_698	BY
Line_699	BECAUSE THE DENSWER ARE CEPT THE LIGHTER ONES WIDE DOWN AND MIXING WITH IT
Line_700	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION S ARE FLOWING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_701	BY MARNEY I CAN WEIGHT TO DO MY NEXT EXPERIMENT WITH YOU
Line_702	UM GRAY HOW ARE YOU
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT IT IS A SATURATED SOLUTE
Line_704	WE NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN DISSOLVE IN WATER OF CORCE WATER AND SOMETHING TO PUT THE SOLID INTO THE WATER WITH
Line_705	WE PUT IN SEVERAL SCOOPS OF SALT UNTOL THE WIRE COULDN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT SO IT WAS SATURATED
Line_706	THERE'S SO MUCH SALT AND THE WATER THAT THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_707	AFTER THREE SCOOPS IT IT BE THE WATER BECAME SATURATED AND THE EPSOM SALT WENT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_708	IT'S TAKING A LOT LONGER TO BECOME SATURATED
Line_709	IT S THE REST OF IT STICK TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE SHIGAR IS ADDING YOU CAN AD
Line_710	THE SHE TOOK LONGER TO B ER TO SATURATE THE W THAN CITRIC ACID
Line_711	THE WATER IS RISING AS YOU PUT IN MORE SALT
Line_712	I DON'T KNOW
Line_713	I'M DOING THAT READY FOR SCIENCE HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_714	WHEN YOU MIXED THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT STARTED FILING UP
Line_715	WE ARE GOING TO MIX MORE ONE OF MORE THAN ONE OF THESE WITH WATER
Line_716	REACTENTS AND PRODUCTS
Line_717	VINEGAR OR WATER
Line_718	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT SO THEY CEMECALLY CHANGED
Line_719	THE REACTENT MOLECULES WHEN MIXED EMICALLY CHANGED
Line_720	BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER
Line_721	THERE ARE TWO PURPLE MOLECULES AND A OF STEEL WATER MOLECULES
Line_722	NO BECAUSE THEY DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND BASICALLY CREATED ONE SUBSTAN
Line_723	THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FIZING UP
Line_724	THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE CARBONATED WATER START FILLING UP WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO THE CUP
Line_725	THE GREY SUBSTANCE WENT INTO THE WATER AND TURND ALL THE WATER GREEN
Line_726	I THINK THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS A CURRENT BECAUSE THE WATER IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE RIM SOBSTANCSE
Line_727	THE SUBSIDANCE ON THE INS THE GLOW STICK THAT CAR A
Line_728	THE WATER CMICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THE GRAPS THAT DON'T TASTE SICK IS MIXED WITH IT
Line_729	NO BECAUSE THE GRAPS THE TAPE STICK IS JUST GOING INTO THE WATER AND NOT REALLY EMICALLY CHANGE IT
Line_730	BYE HELP TO SEE YOU U MI LITER WHEN I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MORE SCIENCE
Line_731	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_732	I SEE THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER FOR THE REACTANT TO CREATE A NUB SUB
Line_733	I SAW A NO PRODUCT AT THE BOTTOM
Line_734	THEY MADE IT FIZZ UP AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
Line_735	IN THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL CHANGE
Line_736	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LONGEST
Line_737	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOSSED
Line_738	THE BAG THAT WAS OPEN LED OUT TO THE GASS THAT WAS CREATE AND THE BAG THAT WAS CLOSED CEPTTHESS AND MAKING ITS WEIGH MORE
Line_739	THE OPEN BAG IS LOWER OR IT WEIGHS LESS THAN THE CLOSED BACK
Line_740	BECAUSE THE OPEN BAG LEFT OUT ER LET THE GASS GO OUT AND THE POSE BACK DIDN'T
Line_741	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_742	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_743	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THEM
Line_744	THE HAS THE SALAD
Line_745	IT HAS EVERYTHING IN IT THAT MAKES IT A MIXTURE
Line_746	IT IS CALLED A MIX WHEN ONE OR MORE MEAN TWO OR MORE THEMS ARE COMPARED
Line_747	A MIXTURE
Line_748	IT IS NOT COMPARED AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IT IS COLD
Line_749	THEY WERE TOKING OUT OF THEIR
Line_750	THEY WERE TOOKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURE AND NOT KEPT TOGETHER ANY
Line_751	THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURES AND NOT CEPT TOGETHE
Line_752	WHEN TRYING TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE SCREEN THEY WERE NOT PUT IN BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO BIG
Line_753	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE FROM THE WATER
Line_754	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE SPANS AND WASHER
Line_755	THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER INTO A MIXTURE AND THEN SEPARATED
Line_756	IT BECAME A MIXTURE AND THEN WAS SEPARATED
Line_757	WHEN IT DISSOLVES IT BECOMES PART OF THE OTHER MIXTURE AND CREATES ONE BIG SOLID
Line_758	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_759	MORE ROLS THAT THEY HAVE IN CREATING THE SOLUTION IS WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE DISSOLVE
Line_760	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_761	THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WAS DISSOLVED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THE SALT WAS TOKEN BY THE WATER AND DIS SAL
Line_762	A DISSOLVATIO
Line_763	NO I DO NOT THINK SO BECAUSE IF AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND USE
Line_764	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SALT AND WATER BEING MIXTURES AND
Line_765	THAT WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER TOGETHER IT JUST MIXES BROWN MY WATER AND WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER IT MAKES A CLEAR SOLID AND LIQUID
Line_766	WHAT HAPEN TO THE SALT IS THAT WHEN THE SAND AND WATER WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE IT WAS DISSOLVED
Line_767	I THINK THAT THE WATER AND THE SOLUTION IS PLAYING THE LIQUID BECAUSE THE GRAP PACSTICK IS A SOLID
Line_768	I THINK THAT IT IS CALLED IT DISSOLVENT
Line_769	I THINK THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURE AND IT'S POSITION IS THE SOLID IN THIS E
Line_770	WE CALLED THE THING THAT DOES DISSOLVING UH DISSOLVENT
Line_771	THE MASS OF THE STUFF GOING IN D GRAM
Line_772	THE MASS IS CREATING A LARGER AMOUNT BECAUSE OF MORE MIXTURE IS BEING BRAT INTO
Line_773	MONEY THIS DOESN'T MAKE SOME
Line_774	WHAT IS THE TURN AREMEYA
Line_775	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE MIXTURE
Line_776	WHAT'S THIS REPEAT
Line_777	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND IT BECAME A MIXTURE SOLUTION
Line_778	WHAT IS THIS OBJECT TO MARNEY
Line_779	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE MIXTURE
Line_780	WELL MARNEY THE WATER IS DISAPEARING FROM EACH DISCH BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING THE SALT IS SHRINKING INTO THE WATER
Line_781	MARNEY WHAT IS DICIPATING MEAN
Line_782	MARNEY CAN USE UMAIN ON THE PIXTURE PLEASE
Line_783	MARNEY CAN WE GO OVER THIS HOLE TESTIGAT
Line_784	YOU TWO MARNEY HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU'RE MY BEST R
Line_785	ONE WAY WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE IS USING A SCREEN ANOTHER IS TAKING A FUNNEL
Line_786	A MIXTURE IS A MIX SOMETHING OF TWO OR MORE OBJECTS MIXED TOGETHER MAKING A CONBONATIO
Line_787	THE OBJECT AND WATER IS BEING SEPARATED FROM WITH FROM THE SCREE
Line_788	MARNEY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MISS
Line_789	MARNEY WHAT IS A PROPER
Line_790	THE AND USING A MAGNET TH IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAGNET USES MAGNETSOME TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_791	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE MIXTURE
Line_792	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE MIXTURE
Line_793	WHAT IF YOU'RE SEEN
Line_794	BECAUSE THE MAGNETISOM WOULDN'T BE AS STRONG
Line_795	I THINK WE USE DIFFERENT TO US ARE DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE IT HELPS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECT
Line_796	I THINK WE USED A MAGNET BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAN WOULD IT BE ABLE TO ST
Line_797	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL SEPARATED FROM FROM THE SAND BECAUSE IT IS A BIGGER OBJECT OBJECT AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_798	I THINK WE USED A FILTER SO THAT THE WATER COULD GO THROUGH AND THE SAND DID NOT
Line_799	WE ACTS YOU
Line_800	I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WENT ON AND SEPARATING THEM THROUGH THE MIXTURE
Line_801	WELL I BEST FAN BY MARNEY MARNEY CAN YOU KEEP TALKING TO BEAT
Line_802	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DILUTE AND CONCIDERATE LIQUIDS AND HAVE BEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_803	WELL TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MIXTURE AND THEN SOME HOW SEPARATE THE MIXTURE
Line_804	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_805	THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_806	BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER AS THE CONCENTRATED ONES
Line_807	IT WOULD TAST NOT AS STRONG AND A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND
Line_808	BY ADDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
Line_809	BY ADDING MORE WATER TO A DIFFERENT CUP
Line_810	BECAUSE YOU COULD ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THEN DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_811	THE AND THE PURPLE AND THE BLUME ONE CUP IS CONCENTRATED AND ONE IS DILUTED
Line_812	I CAN SEE THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO CUPS OF SALT WATER SOLUTION THAT ONE HAS TEN GRAMS SOLUTE AND THE OTHER HAS GRAMS OF SALT
Line_813	THE ONE OF TWENTY GRAMS SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THEN THE ONE IS A GRAM SO BECAUSE IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS
Line_814	MY PRODUCTION WAS CORRECT
Line_815	BECAUSE OF THE GRAMS AND THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE BEING COMPARED WILL BE THE GRAMS BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IS MORE GRAMS OF
Line_816	I THINK WE HAVE TO DUE THE AMOUNT THE MASS AND THE SOLUTE IS THAT THE MOSS IS GRATER AND EXPERIMENT THAN THIS
Line_817	SOLUTION TH ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_818	SOLITION THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION ONE
Line_819	SOLUTION ONE SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCET
Line_820	SOLUTION THREE SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONSTRATING FOR SOLUTION THREE THE LEAST CO
Line_821	SOLUTION A FIR SOLUTION
Line_822	THE SOMETHING IS MORE DENSE WE DROP INTO THE TIN IT FLOW ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM
Line_823	I THINK THIS MEANS A SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT SOLUTION AN
Line_824	WELL IT WOULD DIPEND ON IF IT HAS SALT OR NO
Line_825	THEY DID NOT BLUN THEY DID NOT LU AND THEY DO NOT AN
Line_826	I THINK WHAT IS HAPINING THAT SINCE THEY'RE NOT BLENDING IT'S CAUSING A FORM A CONCENTRATION AND DILUTE
Line_827	IT WOULD NOT BLENCH AND IT WOULD LOOK CON FROM CONCENTRATED TO DILUTION
Line_828	NOT LUNTHING
Line_829	SOMEONE ETHER ADDED TO MAPREASHER OR YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EACH
Line_830	IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF TEN GRAMS OF SALT
Line_831	I NOTICE THAT BLUE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND THEN GREEN IS
Line_832	THAT THE BLUE ESTIPLGRAM SO IS THE HEAVIEST SO ITS IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS THE SUCKING CONCENTRATED AND THEN GREEN IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_833	BECAUSE THE BLUE IS THE HEAVIEST AND GREEN IS THE LIGHT
Line_834	WELL CORN
Line_835	IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE FOR SCOOPS IS MORE AND THE THREE SCOOPS MAKES IT MOR
Line_836	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN DILUT
Line_837	WELL IT DID NOT DISSOLVE ALL THE WAGH
Line_838	GOES N TO THREE SIX FORTY EIGHT TWELL SO I THINK SEA THREE IS THE TWENTIEST ONE AND THEN UM THREE SIX I MEAN SOMETHING ONE AND A SEC
Line_839	THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST LEADING AND
Line_840	THE CRYSTALS GO AWAY
Line_841	WELL THE CRYSTALS WOULD NOT MAKE CLEAR
Line_842	WELL THEY GO IN CLEARALLY TO THE DICH AND DON'T COME OUT
Line_843	DULL CRYSTALS WOULD BE THE MOST UM DENSITY
Line_844	WELL THE
Line_845	WELL EVAPORATED TOGETHER AND MAKING IT ALL MIXTURED THROUGH PRODUCTION
Line_846	IT IS A PRODUCT CAB A TO YOU F
Line_847	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_848	IT MAKES IT THE SOL CRYSTAL WAIT THAT'S A STRAW
Line_849	PERCIPITATION IS HAPPENING AND MAKES IT'S MOIST AND MAKE C SATURATE THE SOLVENT INTO PERCIPITER
Line_850	AND THEN YOU MAKE THE PARTICIPATION GO
Line_851	OR A SCIENCE WELL IT HANDS OVER AND IT MAKES PECIPUTATION
Line_852	WELL AS YOU SHAKE AND MOISING THE BAG THE PERSONS HAND IT'S MAKING FORCIPITATE MORE
Line_853	THE CHEMICAL ACTION CUREND BECAUSE THE PARTIITATION HAPEND AND IT WENT DOWN IN THE CHAIN
Line_854	THE MAGNET IS BRINGING THE PAPERCLIP RIVER
Line_855	THE MAGNET IS MOVING AROUND AND THE THE PAPER CLIP IS STICKING
Line_856	IT'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_857	MAGNETS
Line_858	WHEN I WHEN UP TO NINTEN IT STOPD IT WENT DOWN
Line_859	THE WHEN I WENT UP TO NINTEEN AGAIN THE THE MAGNETS WERE ATTRACTING AT FIRST BUT THEN IT SOR REPELLING
Line_860	IT GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE WASHERS THAN THE MAGNET
Line_861	IT GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER EACH TIME YOU HADD SOMETHING
Line_862	WHEN I ADDED THE WASHER IT GOT SEPARTHE MAGNETS SEPARATED FROM IT
Line_863	I JUST ON ADDING AND ADDING AND ADDING
Line_864	NORTH AND SOUTH CAN NOT CAN BE TOGETHER AND SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH CAN NOT
Line_865	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE TRI
Line_866	WELL YOU YOU PUT THE BATTERY TO THE PUT THE BATTERY
Line_867	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_868	THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_869	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND COMING BACK AROUND AND AROUND
Line_870	MOTOR IS MOVING IT'S MAKE THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK AGAIN
Line_871	BECAUSE MEAN METAL TO TOUCH TO FOR ENERGY TO TO WORK FOR ANY OTHER ENERGY
Line_872	IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE THE ENERGY IS TRAPPED
Line_873	FOR THE SWITCH TE CLOSED
Line_874	NO THINGS HAVE BEEN
Line_875	FOR THE FOR THE SWITCHER TO TURN TO CLOSED
Line_876	IT DOESN'T WORK THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_877	THE SUNLIGHT IS MAKING IT'S LIKE A CALCULATOR MAKING IT WORK BY THE SUN
Line_878	WE HAVE BEEN FOR THE MORE TO RUN IT'S TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN WORK
Line_879	FOR THE SUN LIGHT TO SHIN ON THE THING
Line_880	OR THE SUN FOR THE SUN FOR THE MOTOR TO WORK SO IT CAN WORK
Line_881	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_882	NO MEAN NO
Line_883	IT TURNS THE MOTOR ON
Line_884	IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT FOR THE ENERGY TO WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_885	THE SUN MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_886	THAT'S NOT MOVING ANY MORE
Line_887	THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR ANYMORE
Line_888	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE D CELL IS FROM THE WIRES
Line_889	THINK YOU A LOT
Line_890	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_891	WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE IT'S ENERGY
Line_892	THE NAIL IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_893	UM
Line_894	A CONDUCTOR MAKES ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_895	IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POPSICLE STICK
Line_896	MADE OF IS PLASTIC SO
Line_897	THAT ELECTRICITY IS ENERGY
Line_898	UM BECAUSE CONDUCTING IS NOT FLOWING
Line_899	IT'S NOT SPINNING STEEL
Line_900	I NOTICE ABOUT THE PAPER CLIP THAT IS MAKING THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_901	I AM DOING GROD HOW ARE YOU
Line_902	WE WERE WE'VE BEEN DOING MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS TO WORK AT THE SAME TIM
Line_903	Y IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRODUCES LIGHT
Line_904	ACTUALLY A CANDLE PRODUCING HEAT ENERGY
Line_905	IT GETS IT COMES WAX OFF WAX IT COMES OFF AND THEN IT HAS TO HEAT FOR HEAT AND IT
Line_906	IT MAKES IT'S BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
Line_907	THE WAX
Line_908	NO AND HE
Line_909	IT SOUNDED LIKE NOFTHING
Line_910	TO SEE THE WAX MELTING AND THE FIRE BERNING
Line_911	IN IT HAS A COLOR THAT WE CAN SEE
Line_912	BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_913	IT PRODUCES SOUND ENERGY
Line_914	YOU CAN HEARE THE SOUND WHEN THE STICK IS BANGING ON THE RUB
Line_915	A GIRL IS WALKING UP A MOUNT IN
Line_916	CHEREPE DA
Line_917	BY AN THE HELTHY SNACK S LIKE AN APPLE ANUS OR GRATE
Line_918	I SEE A FOUL S A BRANCH CANDLE APPLES AND A CABINET
Line_919	IT'S HEAT IN TO TURN TO FIRE
Line_920	IT IS MAKING IT MOVES
Line_921	IT'S MAKING THE MOTORE MOVE
Line_922	H IT'S MAKING IT PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_923	I DON'T KNOW
Line_924	BECAUSE THE SOLAR PANEL CAN MIKE STUFF MOVE AND THE ONE THING CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE TWO
Line_925	THAT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_926	ENERGY UM
Line_927	IMPORTANT BY MIXED UP IN THIS MOVING
Line_928	BILDING CIRCUITS CAMERS ON HI DON'T KNOW
Line_929	IT MEANS TO WELL HOU HAM TODAY
Line_930	WE I'VE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_931	A CIRCUIT S OUT TURNINGS THE ON
Line_932	THE BATTERIES MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_933	SO THEY CAN ALL LIGHT UP SO IT CAN MAKE ALL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_934	UM IT'S MAKING IT LIGHED UP BY A LIGHT BULB I MEAN ATER ER PAN
Line_935	UM THE D CELLS ARE GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS TO WORK
Line_936	THOSE ARE THE D CELLS THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB PORK
Line_937	BYE MAKING THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_938	ITS TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB IN THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_939	BY CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_940	GOT THAT
Line_941	THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS IN THEM
Line_942	THEY WELL NOT WORK BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE BATTERY AND THERE'S LIKE FIFTEEN OF THEM LIKE BULBS
Line_943	UM THE TELL MAKE TO LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTER
Line_944	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_945	UM BECAUSE THERE'S THE TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER I N NO
Line_946	UM THEY BOTH MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK TO CREEN ENERGY
Line_947	THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_948	ENERGY
Line_949	IT HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_950	THEY BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING
Line_951	THE BATTERY IS MAKING TWO BULBS WORK
Line_952	THE BULBS ARE GOING TO WOUND AND THE WOUND
Line_953	UM IT WILL GET MORE BRIGHTER
Line_954	I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
Line_955	ELECTRICITY COMES FROM A BATTERY
Line_956	THE BLUE DOTS BY THE ENERGY GOING AROUND AND AROUND IT FROM THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_957	THE MINE OF THE IN THIS PIXTURE IS A BATTERY MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS BORK
Line_958	THAT THEY ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_959	THE BATTERIES MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_960	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR ON SIDE
Line_961	IT'S FLOWING BY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_962	C THE ENERGY BY BLUE LIGHT BULBS AND THE L THE WIRES
Line_963	I NOTICE THAT LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP AT THE WIRE
Line_964	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I FORGOT
Line_965	UM WITH TWO BATTERIES IT CAN MAKE IT BRIGHTER
Line_966	YEES
Line_967	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE MORE RIGHTER
Line_968	BYE MARCH LIGHT BULB FWORK
Line_969	THE SECUANT ONE
Line_970	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_971	NOT SO MUCH
Line_972	IT SHOWES THE LIGHT BULB
Line_973	IT HAS MAGNETS FORCE IN THEM
Line_974	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_975	BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL
Line_976	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_977	BECAUSE IT IS METAL IRON OR STEEL
Line_978	YES BECAUSE IT IS METAL I RE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_979	I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_980	BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE IRON IN THEM
Line_981	MORE MY MORE METAL STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_982	OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR OR FORCE FOR ITS SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_983	SOME METALS FOR MAGNETS CAN STICK SO IT CAN WORK
Line_984	IRON
Line_985	IRON CAN STICK TO METAL BECAUSE IT HAS LITTLE MAGNETS IN THEM
Line_986	THE ONE THAT'S NOT ALUMINIUM BECAUSE THAT HAS MORE OR ON AND THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S METAL
Line_987	SO THE ROCK THE RING AND THE ALUMIUN NAIL CAN'T STICK
Line_988	UH IT WILN'T WORKS IT HAS NO METAL OR IN IT IN IT
Line_989	THAT THE GREY ROCK DOESN'T STICK
Line_990	THAT IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEY HAS NO METAL IN IT OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_991	STICK CAUSE IT HAS M IT'S METAL
Line_992	IT'S WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT SO LIKE A LITTALE STUFF IN THERE
Line_993	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL INSIDE IT
Line_994	IRON METL IT STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_995	TALK ABOUT STUFF THAT CON STICK TO METAL AND STUFF THAT CAN STICK TO METAL
Line_996	ONE IS SWIRES TWO WIRES A BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_997	THEY GIVE OUT ENERGY FOR ST
Line_998	SOURCE IS ANOTHER WAY FOR SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU YES
Line_999	UM WHAT THEY THEY DO IS THEY GIVE MORE AND KIND OF
Line_1000	I THINK IT'S A PATHRY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LIKE A PATH BECAUSE IT'S SO LIKE THIN A PATH IS THIN
Line_1001	LIGHT BULBS R R SOMETHING THAT GIVES STEEL LIGHT
Line_1002	THEY HELP YE SEE AND MANY PLACES
Line_1003	A RECEIVER IS ANOTHER WORM FOR A LIGHT BULB
Line_1004	THAT MEANS THATS HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER THEY IS THEY DID VERY GOOD AND THAT THEY MADE LIGHT
Line_1005	LITTLE TINY ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE IS ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1006	IT OH DIPENDS
Line_1007	UM WHERE THERE ARE IS A MINESE SIDE
Line_1008	WELL THERE IS RED ON THAT SIDE AND THERE ARE IS A FLAT SIGHT ON THAT SIDE
Line_1009	THAT THE BATTERY TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S DOING THE OPES THING
Line_1010	NO IT IS THE MINUS SCIENCE IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN A LIGHT BULB IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE BATTERY AGAIN
Line_1011	I'M SARY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1012	THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CORRETE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKE LIGHT WITH THAT
Line_1013	IT WILL NOT CARRY ENERGY AND YOUR BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1014	YOU'VE BEEN REALLY THING TO MEAN I WHOP I SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1015	THE LITTLE FLAG IS SHURE MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT MEANS THE IT IS WORKING
Line_1016	IF THE FLAG IS MADE AN THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1017	IT NEADS ENERGY FOR TO RUN OR GASOLINE
Line_1018	THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY AND ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1019	IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT TURNS U
Line_1020	IT TURNS ON ONES FOUL TURN ON THE SWITCH
Line_1021	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1022	AS FLOW IN THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1023	IT'S THE FLY COLD IT MOVES
Line_1024	NO BECAUSE IF THE CO DAY IS BLOCKING THE SUN
Line_1025	WHEN IT'S COUDY THE L FLAG STOP
Line_1026	THEIT IS IS MOVING AND AND WORKING
Line_1027	WHEN THE SUN GETS TO MOTOR IT TRFTS TO M
Line_1028	ER A FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1029	BECAUSE IT'S METAL AND METAL I THINK HAS IROGY
Line_1030	WELL USUALLY WHAT MAKES THE MOTOR WORK IS NOT ALL NOFTHING ELSE TO D
Line_1031	USUALLY A NAIL
Line_1032	THE THINGS REALLY HAPPINING AND SIDE AND YEAH
Line_1033	USUALLY AN INSULATOR IS METAL AND THE CONDUCTOR IS USUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
Line_1034	IN THE LITERS ARE TOGERLY NOT METAL YEAH I SO YEAH
Line_1035	OK AND IT STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1036	THEY THEY DON'T R ALL
Line_1037	WELL CONDUCTORS HE RE UM SOMETHING METAL ASUALLY
Line_1038	
Line_1039	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TRICK AND ONE CIRCUIT
Line_1040	BECAUSE AH WITHOUT ENERGY THESE COULDN'T BE MOVING
Line_1041	YOU WOULD SAKE FIL HEAT
Line_1042	THE HEAT IS PROBABLY FLOWING AND GIVING US ENERGY
Line_1043	YES I HEAR CLAMSBEARNEY
Line_1044	IT'S ON A KIND OF LIKE ASHE SO
Line_1045	FIRE AR THE FLAME IS MAYEREEN SUCH SIDE
Line_1046	IT MAKES THE BIG THUM
Line_1047	BECAUSE ENERGY IS USED WEIGH TE WHEN YOU MOE
Line_1048	IT MAKES ALLOWED SOUND AND YOU'RE WASTE YOUR ENERGY
Line_1049	WE HEAR ALLOWEDS UN
Line_1050	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY TO WALK
Line_1051	BY FIELD AND APPLES FRIELDS SWATCHE BULBS
Line_1052	THE IT WOULD CAUSE A FLAME
Line_1053	YOU SEE KIND OF LIKE A GRAY THING LIKE A GRAY CLOUD GOING UP
Line_1054	THE Y WEN
Line_1055	THEY GET ENERGY BY THE SAME THING
Line_1056	T THERE ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1057	IT WOULD CREATE SHOE EACH FLAME
Line_1058	BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT AND ENERGY THEY GET ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THING
Line_1059	YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH TO W
Line_1060	EVEEN TRYING TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1061	THE CIRCUIT MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT HELPS MORE INSTEAD OF USING THE HANDS
Line_1062	IT HELPS IT BUB HELPS THE LIGHT BUB LIGHT UP
Line_1063	TO SO J THE SAME THING JUST ATWITCT IT IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE SOME MATERIALS THE CIRCUIT FOLED
Line_1064	PASWAY
Line_1065	THE WOODULTS ARE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_1066	WE THINK OF AS LITTLE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND COMING OUT LIKE THE TA
Line_1067	WELL YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEY START TO LIGHT UP MORE AND MORE
Line_1068	MAYBE MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO BE A IN WEIGH TO FOR TO LIGHT UP
Line_1069	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD HOW ARE YO
Line_1070	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH THE BATTERIES
Line_1071	THEY ARE ALL KINDS OF MAG FIRST IT'S A MAGNET THEN IT'S A WHORCHO MAGNET AND THEN IT JUST THE REAR MAGNET
Line_1072	WELL THEY CARRY ENERGY INSIDE OF IT ANDIT STICK TO AND STINK STEEL AND ME
Line_1073	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1074	YES BECAUSE THE WHOLE ENTIRE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL SO THE STEEL STICKS TO ANYTHING MAGNET IN IT
Line_1075	IT'S LIKE PROBABLY LIKE CORAL TWENTY MAGNETS BECAUSE THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER
Line_1076	THE NAIL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL THE OTHER ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL SO IT WON'T BE ABL TO STICK
Line_1077	OH I I NEVER KNOW THAT WELL I JUST LEARND SOMETHING NU TODAY
Line_1078	UM STEEL THAT'S FOR HER STEEL
Line_1079	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1080	THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1081	WHEN THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BATTERY AND ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB THEY MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1082	THEY ARE PRITY MUCH THE ENERGY THAT MAKE THE LIGHT BULB GO ON AND THE WIRES THAT HIT IT
Line_1083	IT HELPS ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S COIN TO LIKE THE BATTERY FOR THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1084	IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE
Line_1085	THEY ARE A PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY WHICH IS THE SOURCE ENERGY SOURCE AND TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_1086	ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
Line_1087	THEY CARRY ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY SO THAT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1088	THE LIGHT BULB HER UM IS FOR THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY SO THEY WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1089	IN THE LIGHT BULB THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE FILM AND THE FILM HELPS IT LIGHT UP
Line_1090	IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY
Line_1091	WHEN IT DOES THIS I THINK THERE IS ELECTRICITY SO THEN WE CAN HAVE LIGHT
Line_1092	THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1093	THE NEGATIVE ER THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1094	IT COMES TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES TOWARDS THE WIRE IT COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE BATTERY
Line_1095	THE BLUE DOTS REPROENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1096	THE ELECT LITTLE ELECTRICITY BLUE DOTS ARE GOING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_1097	IT TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY STARTED FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1098	IT GOES BACK THE WAY THEN ITS STARTED
Line_1099	IT MIGHT GO FASTER OR THEY WOULD BOTH HIT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT MIGHT LIGHT UP OR IT MIGHT NOT
Line_1100	WHEN THEY'RE ON ONE'S ON THE SIDE AND ONES ON THE BOTTOM IT WORKS BUT WHEN HEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1101	THE MOTOR FLAT THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1102	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1103	IT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND ITS THE ENERGY IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_1104	IT IS THE ENERGY AND IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CAR YOU MEAN THE BATTERY FOR THE CAR FOR IT TO WORK
Line_1105	IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE ONE SIDE WHERE IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IN THAT'S WHY THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING
Line_1106	THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR STARTS WORKING SO THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING IT WON'T WORK
Line_1107	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING WHAT IS LIKE CLOSED
Line_1108	A SOLAR THING IS MAKES SOME THINGS WORK
Line_1109	IF THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEN THERE IS NO ENERGY COMING DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO MAKE THERE
Line_1110	IT WOULDN'T WORK WE WERE GONNA DO THAT TO DY ALSO BUT IT WAS LOUDY DAY SO IT DIDN'T WORK IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK
Line_1111	IT MAKES THE SOLAR PANEL HAVE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR YOU SHOWD MY THIS BEFOR AND I CAN IN
Line_1112	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1113	YOU TO BYE MARNEY
Line_1114	GOOD HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU MAN MARNEY
Line_1115	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_1116	I SEE THAT THE JENERATOR FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TURNED LIKE TO WHERE IT WOULD BE AL
Line_1117	IT MAKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS IT WORKS RIGHT
Line_1118	OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DON'T WORK
Line_1119	BYE MARNEY THINKS FOR THE TOTOERINGBYE
Line_1120	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PRESANCE OF ENERGY
Line_1121	THIS IS THE CANDLE AND IT'S LIKE THE WARM FLOATED A CHANDROWBAG
Line_1122	THE HEAT IS MAKING THE IT'S SO HOT IT MAKES THE WAX MELT IT'S LIKE A CARD WHEN YOU GO IT BURNS OFF THE GASS
Line_1123	I LIKE WHEN I WENT BY IT OR I COULD SEE IT'S IT'S LIKE HOT
Line_1124	THAT THE GASS OR THE WAX IS LIKE GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE HEAT IS LIKE MAKING IT SO HOT THAT THE WAX
Line_1125	UM LIGHT
Line_1126	THERE WAS NO SOUND THE THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AT ALL
Line_1127	A PERSON IS BAKING ON DRUMS
Line_1128	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE IS EATING FOD SHE IS EATING THE A
Line_1129	IT IS MAKING SOUND
Line_1130	I SEE WOOD FOUL LIKE GASS OLAIN I SEE A CANDLE AND THREE APPLES
Line_1131	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP BOTH LIGHT THE WIRE AND THE BATTERY
Line_1132	IT'S ALL CONNECTED
Line_1133	M CA WELL IN THE ELECTRICITY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES AND IN TO THE LIGHT TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1134	THE WHAT'S ON DO SAY
Line_1135	MANY THE CIRCUIT IS THE WHOLE THING CONNECTED AND THE PATHWAYS ARE THE WIRES
Line_1136	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE TOH THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE
Line_1137	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING IN THE WEIGHT
Line_1138	THE BLUDOTS ARE A LITTLE ENERGY AND ENERGY
Line_1139	OKAY I DID THAT MARNEY NO WHAT BUT YOU LICMADE T
Line_1140	YUSUALLY ONE OR TWO OR MORE
Line_1141	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND WORK
Line_1142	WHEN YOU TAKE A BATTERY UP AWAY IT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE AS BRIGHT
Line_1143	IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE
Line_1144	YO UM THE ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS AREN'T BRIGHT AT ALL BUT ON THE TWO D CELL FITS ARE REALLY REALLY RA
Line_1145	YES AND IT WA IT LIKE WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL THE LIGHTS THE BULBS OR LIGHTS GOT VERY
Line_1146	WE HAVE BEEN BILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1147	IT HAS LIKE IT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_1148	I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THE WIRES
Line_1149	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THOS T
Line_1150	THE PATHWAY IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1151	THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND IT MOVES LIKE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1152	YEAH THE PATHWAY OR THE WIRES FOR BOTH THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
Line_1153	AND BLUE DOTS ARE THE LITTLE DOTS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1154	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING LIKE THROUGH THE LIKE LITTLE PIECES OF ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH EVER ANYTHING
Line_1155	WE WILL HAVE TO ADD MORE COMPONENTCE LIKE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE WIRES
Line_1156	IF WE HADD MORE THAN ONE D CELL THE BULBS WILL LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1157	I SEE THAT SOME OF THE TIME THE BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY IT'S DIFFERENT
Line_1158	WITH TWO D CELLS IT GOES BRIGHTER BUT ONES THE ONE LIGHT BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK
Line_1159	BECAUSE IT THEN BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND NOT THE POSITIV
Line_1160	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1161	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY
Line_1163	I SEE TWO TWO BULBS AND ONE D CELL
Line_1164	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1165	THE LIGHTS WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE A LITTLE A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT OR A LOT BRIGHT
Line_1166	I JUST TOLD YOU
Line_1167	MAY BEE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1168	WE E PLEASE
Line_1169	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1170	THEY'RE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_1171	A D CELL BATTERY
Line_1172	THEY'RE ALL ABOUT UM HOW THEY THEY UM POWER EVERYTHING I DON'T I THINK
Line_1173	I MEAN THAT IT POWERES MOSTLY EVERY THING
Line_1174	POWER ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SOURCE
Line_1175	LIGHT BULBS UM HELP LIGHT COM INTO THE ROME
Line_1176	IT MEANS THAT IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROOM TO GET LIGHTER
Line_1177	IT'S GOING UP AND DOWN AND UNDER
Line_1178	THE BOTTOM ONE WHICH IS RINING THE POWER AGAIN THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_1179	THEY POR THE POWER ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1180	I NOTICE IT SWITCHED AROUND SO IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW

Line_1279	A BE SCIENCE CAN YOU A PIE DOESN'T GET ME A PIE
Line_1280	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1281	THE SOUTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL STICK BUT IF SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL REPEL
Line_1282	I CANT CAVISA TO THE LESOMDER
Line_1283	IT'S METAL SO IT'LL ATTRACT A MAGNET
Line_1284	I NEAIL IS STICKING TO A DONE SHAPED MAGNE
Line_1285	IT STICKS BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL IS META
Line_1286	THE METAL DOES NOT ATTRACT TO THE BLOCK BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
Line_1287	BECAUSE WOOD CAN ATTRACT TO A MAGNET BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR METALOR STEEL
Line_1288	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NEIL HAS ONE NEAIL HAS IRON AND METAL AND THE OTHER DOESN'T
Line_1289	IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_1290	I THINK IT'S HAS METAL OR STEEL OR IRON IN IT BECAUSE IT'S STICKING
Line_1291	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET

Line_1293	BECAUSE IT'S STEEL METAL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1294	I'M GOOD I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1295	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1296	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
Line_1297	THE D CELL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN IT GIVES OFF ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1298	IT MEANS LIKE A PASSWAY TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ENERGY AND THE WIRES
Line_1299	I THINK TRAVELS MANS LIKE IT GOES LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO SEND OFF ELECTRICITY
Line_1300	THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY
Line_1301	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ABOUT LIKE TO CENTIML LIGHT SO THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IT'S NOT JUST TO PITCH BLACK PLACE
Line_1302	IT MEANS LIKE IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE WIRES
Line_1303	I SEE THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT AND GOING IN THE CIRCLE SO THEN YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1304	IT IS FLOWING THE LEFT WAY LIKE IT GOES DRIGHE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S GOING AROUND
Line_1305	HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_1306	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE WIRES I SEE HOW IT PICTURE HOW IT'S GOING THROUGH AND AN GO AND OUT THAT D
Line_1307	THE END OF THE D CELL IS WITH THE MINES ON IT
Line_1308	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1309	THE AS PEN THAT THE THE DARN THE ELECTRICITY FROM
Line_1310	I DON'T KNOTICE ANYTHING UM SORY I DON'T KNOTICE ANY
Line_1311	IT GOES THE OPOSIT WAY ITS GOING NO WHIT'S GOING THE LEFT WAY NOT THE RIGH
Line_1312	IT GOES THE SI WAY IT WAS FOLING
Line_1313	THE MINEST
Line_1314	WHAT'S IT UP I DON'T SEE ANY IT UP
Line_1315	M I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HENCE ABOUT IT
Line_1316	UH A D CELL TO MAKE IT WORK IF IF THERE WASN'T A D CELL THEN NO WOULD THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1317	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING AND IT WON'T WORK
Line_1318	I NOTICE THAT WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH THE FLAG STOPS TO MOVE AND THEN WHEN IT CLICK IT AGAIN THEN IT STOPS MOVING
Line_1319	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR HAS WIRES HAVE TO WEIGH AND THE WIRES OF D UP TO THE SOLAR POWER
Line_1320	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN IT MEANS THAT IT'S CONLECTING ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR POWER TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_1321	IT WON'T WORK AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN HOW WILL YOU MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_1322	THE FLAG IS THE MOTOR IS RUNING
Line_1323	WHAT I NOTICE IS THE FLAG IS NOT MOVING
Line_1324	IF THE ROG IS MOVING THEN IT MEANS THERE IS NOT ENOUFF ENERGY TO POWER IT
Line_1325	WELL NO HOW IS YOUR D
Line_1326	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1327	CAN YOU PLEASE US THE QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1328	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BY THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1329	UH ANYTHING THAT'S METAL CON MAKE MOTOR
Line_1330	I NOTICE THAT IF THI STICKS WOOD AND IT DOESN'T COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY AND THE THE MOTORS NOT RUNING
Line_1331	IT'S HAS PUNNALS THA T
Line_1332	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT CLCTRN AGAIN
Line_1333	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1334	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THE I'VE BEEN DOING THE LITTLE ED RIGHT RIGHT NO AROUND MAN THING YOU STICK AN SMAX SO IT CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1335	THE MOTOR WHAT HAPENS TO THE MOTOR IS IT DOESN'T RUN
Line_1336	PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1337	THEY ARE MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1338	WE RIGHT NO SOME CAN YOU PLEASE B A
Line_1339	THE BRASS THE PAPER CLIP THE WHOLED ON THE SH R
Line_1340	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1341	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGGER OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1342	WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR SHE WHAT IT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1343	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YULE
Line_1344	IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT
Line_1345	YOU I DON'T SHRINK IT ONE THE CANDLE BROWNS
Line_1346	IF A CANDLE DIDN'T MAKE SOUND THEN IT WOULD MAKE LIKE POMNOISES
Line_1347	I TO SEE THAT THE FLAME IS MOVING BACK AND FORWARD FORTH SLOWLY
Line_1348	I SEE THAT THERE IS A FOLE WOOD AND THE CANDLE AND THIS THREE APPLES
Line_1349	THINKING AROUND
Line_1350	IT TURNED INTO SMOLT
Line_1351	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1352	THE MOTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SHINING IN A CIRCLE RE
Line_1353	WE TAPED TAH
Line_1354	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_1355	THEY BOTH COULD AND
Line_1356	AND COAL AND GASS WOULD MAKE OF FIRE
Line_1357	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1358	MAYBE PHEACD S
Line_1359	I DO NOT COMPLETE THREE NO
Line_1360	UM WE PE BLUE BESE
Line_1361	WE PEACED POLLESE
Line_1362	I KEEP THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT ENERGY CAUSE YOU HAVE E LIGHT BULBS AND THERE IT WON'T BE THAT BRIGHT
Line_1363	RAYBE S LS SQUEESE
Line_1364	IF YOU ADD ONE MORE UM MORE D CHELLS THE LIGHT BULB U LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1365	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1366	WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SIENT WE'VE BEEN DOING SOL STUDYES NOT SCIENCE
Line_1367	WHAT I OBSERVED ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT IS THAT THEY COULD STICK TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1368	WHAT IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH STICKING TO A MAGNET IS THAT A MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS IRON AND STEEL
Line_1369	WHAT'S IN THE METAL IS IT'S LIKE TINY BITS OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT HELPS IT STICK
Line_1370	ER PEAKED THESE
Line_1371	IT IS TROUGH THAT PAPER CLIPS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1372	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1373	I'M GOOD TO THAN HOW ARE YOU
Line_1374	WHAT WOULD HAVPEN IS THAT N
Line_1375	I THINK THAT BECAUSE I LEARNED IT
Line_1376	THEY'RE FACING THE SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER AND NOT THE NOT ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO REPEL
Line_1377	THE SUMMER ABOUT EM IS THAT SOUTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THE FRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE FACING THEY'RE NOPE IT DIRECTION SO DON'T ATTRACT
Line_1378	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1379	WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS THAT TO LEARN ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_1380	
Line_1381	WHAT MAKES ME SAY THAT IS BECAUSE I TRYDED IT WITH THE MAGNET AND A PAPER CLIP AND I I RED IT UP TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WHICH IS LIKE ATTRACT
Line_1382	OK I THE MAGNET IS SENDING UM MAGNETISOM THROUGH THE NAIL TO PICK UP THEIR ST OK
Line_1383	THREE PLEASE
Line_1384	T WITH THAT E MOM WAS PAYING YOU PAN
Line_1385	RE PE CHASE
Line_1386	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET STATCHOLS WHEN THE RING CALL
Line_1387	WHIT'S ABOUT IS THAT YO WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT A MAGNET WILL ATTRACT
Line_1388	WHAT MAKES ME SEE THAT IS BECAUSE I TEST IT IT OUT
Line_1389	WHAT'S ABOUT THAT IS I HAND
Line_1390	NOT REALLY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1391	SKIMMEY BREAN WA TIE
Line_1392	THE PA
Line_1393	HE RED I CITY
Line_1394	THE LEAD ME NO NO TO BE DON
Line_1395	I COLLECTED FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_1396	WET IS A BIG B ONE
Line_1397	LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1398	A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1399	THEY POWER STUFF LIKE COMPUTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_1400	IT STORES ENERGY AND THEN IT GIVES OTHER THINGS ENERGY TO USE
Line_1401	I DON'T KNOWI DON'T
Line_1402	ELECTRICITY OR POWDER
Line_1403	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THEY RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES OR THE BATTERY
Line_1404	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1405	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE POSITIVE END
Line_1406	IT GOES TOWARDS THE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NE
Line_1407	IT GOES BACK TO WHAT IT WAS NORMALLY AD THE ELECTRICITY FLOWES BACK TO THE SIDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO IND THE FIRST
Line_1408	IT IT GOES OUT TROUGH THE NEGATIVE TOUCH
Line_1409	IT WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T FLOW LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TWO
Line_1410	THE SIDES THE SIDES WORK
Line_1411	WE'VE BEEN LOWDING LEARNING HOW A MOTOR WORK
Line_1412	BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWER BY THE D CELL AND THE MOTOR IS POWERING THE FLAG
Line_1413	THAT THERE IS POWER IN THE MOTOR IT HAS ANDRE
Line_1414	THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D CELL
Line_1415	MI I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLYI DON'T
Line_1416	IT IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER SO THE FLAG CAN ON
Line_1417	THIS IS UM MOTOR WITH A SWITCH A CIRCUIT WITH A SWIT
Line_1418	THE MOTOR IS SPINING
Line_1419	BECAUSE THE SWITCH WAS IN TOUCHING THE WIRE
Line_1420	IT STOPS BECAUSE IT CAN FLOW TROUGH THE PULB TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1421	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1422	WHEN IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE THE MOTOR SPINS WHEN IT'S NOT THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_1423	I WAS ABSENT THAT DAY
Line_1424	THAT THE SUN IS THERE TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_1425	IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1426	THE THE FLAG STORES SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1427	IT PRODUCES ENERGY SO THE SOR SOLAR PANEL CAN GET ENERGY FOR THE MO
Line_1428	IT IS A CIRCUIT WITH THE MOTOR
Line_1429	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING OT WA ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH
Line_1430	HOW ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SOMETHINGS BUT NOT OTHERS
Line_1431	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO EVERY SINGAL PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1432	THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1433	SOME OF THE STUFF AND THE LIST WORKS BUT OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE SPONGE ON THE ROCKS
Line_1434	THAT WITH U STICK THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_1435	IT IS OPEN
Line_1436	IT DOES IN IT STOPS SPINNING
Line_1437	UH I COULDN'T MOVE MY ITUMS SO
Line_1438	THEY ARE METALLE
Line_1439	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS ATTRACT AND REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1440	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1441	THEY ARE MAKING THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
Line_1442	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_1443	IT IS IN JUST TWO WIRES IT'S FOR WIRES
Line_1444	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S ON PATHWAY
Line_1445	EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_1446	THEY'RE LIGHTING UPS REALLY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE I THINK THEY EACH HAS THEIR ON WHAT YOU PATHWAY
Line_1447	THERE ARE LIGHT BULBS WILL SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1448	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1449	REPEATED THAT PLA
Line_1450	IT IS SHOWING THE PATHWAY IT'S GOING
Line_1451	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS BUT ONE D CELL
Line_1452	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOP ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE LIGHT BULBS ON THE BULB
Line_1453	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_1454	NEED A THEY NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_1455	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IT CONNECTED IT'S NOT
Line_1456	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT DOESN'T
Line_1457	YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE LIGHT BULB OR D CELL
Line_1458	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WORKS BETTER THAN A NORMAL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS ON PATH
Line_1459	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY OF ENERGY
Line_1460	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_1461	YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NOT LIGHT BULB
Line_1462	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND NO THE THERE IS NO PATHWAY
Line_1463	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
Line_1464	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1465	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1466	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS UH
Line_1467	A SERIES I MEAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1468	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS CEP LIGHTING
Line_1469	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS STOLE HEAPS GIVING
Line_1470	ONE FILLIMAM BROK BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS ARE STILL WORKING
Line_1471	THE FILM IN IT BURNS OUT BUT THE LIGHT BULB THE OTHER LIGHT BULB STU
Line_1472	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTS TO THE D CELL
Line_1473	THERE IS A BEURN OUT FILMMA
Line_1474	BECAUSE THE FILM BROK AND THERE IS NO OTHER PATHWAY TO GET SO THEE LIGHT BULB
Line_1475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1476	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1477	I LEARNED OUT IN CLASS THAT IRON OR STEEL ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_1478	THE THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FREE
Line_1479	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE RE FRIGERATE
Line_1480	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET THE MA YEAH
Line_1481	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1482	S YES THERE IS ER OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1483	WORD DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1484	IRONS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_1485	THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF IT
Line_1486	THEY STICK TO STUFF THAT R MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1487	ONE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_1488	THE ONE THAT IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_1489	THE STUFF THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT STICKS BUT THE STUFF DOES THAT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1490	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN I
Line_1491	IT STICKS
Line_1492	ULB IT MAY HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT AND THAT'S A
Line_1493	SOME METALS HAVE IRON IN THEM OR STEEL AND THOSE WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1494	BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL AND A INSIDE OF
Line_1495	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1496	NORTH AND SOUTH NORTH AND SOUTH STICK TOGETHER FOR NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH RE
Line_1497	THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE MAGNET ARE STICKING
Line_1498	BECAUSE SIDES NORTH AND NORTH WE L SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH A TRACK
Line_1499	SIDES NORTH AND NORTH SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1500	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING FOR SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ATTRACTING
Line_1501	A GIRL HIKING NORTH
Line_1502	I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S POINTING NORTH
Line_1503	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACT BUT NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1504	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH THEY TRAC
Line_1505	SIDE'S NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL E
Line_1506	THERE IS A MAGNET MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUT THE TABLE IS STOPING IT FROM GETTING ALL THE WEIGH THERE
Line_1507	UH THERE'S NOT ENUFF FORCE TO REACH THE PAPER CLIP SO IT CAN MOVE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1508	THE MAGNET IS TRAVELING THE MAGNEGATIVE FLOOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1509	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING INTO THE NAIL AND IT'S MAKING IT ACT LIKE A M
Line_1510	THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL STICK LIKE A MAGNET SO THE PAPER CLICK CAN STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_1511	THE MAGNET NEEDS TO BE IF REALLY STRONG
Line_1512	AT THE TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_1513	BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORCE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRAVELS THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICKS UP THE PAPER
Line_1514	IT HELPS THE NAIL GET A MAGNETIC FORCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1515	THE NAIL WOULD LUSE ITS FORCE
Line_1516	IT WON'TS BECOME A MAGNET IF HER MAGNET IS ANT TOUCHING IT
Line_1517	THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET WHICH IS PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1518	IT'S BECOMING A TEMPORARL AIR YOU MAGNET
Line_1519	IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING IT AND THEN IT HAS A MAGNETIC FORM
Line_1520	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1521	THE NAIL IS BECOMING A TEMPORARL TEMPORARLLY MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UFF THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1522	BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1523	IT'S SHOWING OF A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1524	THAT IF IT'S TOUCHING IT FOR MAGNET IS TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT THING CAN BECOME A TEMPORARY MA
Line_1525	THE MAGNET IS GIVING THE PAP THE NAIL MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1526	WIDE
Line_1527	IT'S CHECKING HOW MANY WASHERS IT CAN TAKE AND TALL THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS IS BROKEN UP
Line_1528	ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE IS TWO MAGNETS AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS A BUNCH OF WASHERS
Line_1529	WHEN I ADD MORE WASHERS THE IT
Line_1530	THE HOT IT BRAKES UP THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT
Line_1531	THE DISTANCE IS GROWING
Line_1532	IT BREAKS IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE
Line_1533	THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1534	THE FORCIS STRONG ENUFF SO EVEN ONE WASHER COULD BREAK UP THE WHOLE THE WHOLE FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_1535	YOU PUT MORE SPACERS
Line_1536	THE MAGNETIC FORCE GETS UH IT GETS EASIER TO BREAK EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A SPACER
Line_1537	IT BRAKES UP THE FORCE A LITTLE
Line_1538	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1539	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACT SIDES NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH
Line_1540	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1541	GETTING THE RIVET TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET
Line_1542	YOU RAPID AROUND THE RIVET AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN
Line_1543	IT MAKES THE RIVERET BECOME A MAGNET
Line_1544	IT BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1545	WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S THE RIVET BECOMES A MAGNET BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT STOPS
Line_1546	IT STOPS BECOMING A MAGNET
Line_1547	THERE IS AN ELECTRONIC FORCE AROUND THE RAPPED WASHER
Line_1548	YOU HAVE TO RAP IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_1549	UH YOU NEED A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1550	THE RIVET BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1551	IT OPENS OR CLOSES THE M
Line_1552	IT HAS TO BE NEXT TO THE RIVET
Line_1553	WHEN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE STEEL RIVET ISN'T A MAGNET ANYMORE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S A MAGNET

Line_1561	THE SOURCE OF ENERGY MEANS THAT IT STORES ENERGY
Line_1562	IT PROVIDES ENERGY
Line_1563	T TO TO TO PROVIDE ANY
Line_1564	THEY MAKE THE FLOW THE ENERGY CONTRAVELS THROUGH IN THEM TO POWER
Line_1565	S HAVE A LIMIT AND IT DOES HELP TO
Line_1566	THE IT MEANS THAT ITS RECEIVE THE ENERGY
Line_1567	AND REFLECT HEAT AND IT MAKES LIGHT
Line_1568	THE TREE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB IS TO POWERAT THE FILM
Line_1569	BECAUSE THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1570	THE ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB GOING AN TO THE LIGHT BU
Line_1571	TI IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1572	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IT STORED AND THE LIGHT BULBE AND IT ONES SOMETHING HITS IT IT GOES OUT OF IT AND
Line_1573	THE POSITIVE NO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1574	THE LITTLE DOTS INCLIP THIS PIXTURES THE ENERGY FULLY MAKE TRAVEL THROUGH IT IN THE CUP
Line_1575	LOW IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1576	BLUB DREROANT AS AND
Line_1577	IF FLIPED AROUND THEN THE ENERGY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT TO OTHER END
Line_1578	IT UM THE LIGHT BULB GOES OFF AND THEN A TURNS AROUND THEN ENERGY COMES OUT TO WHERE THE POSITIVE SIDE WILL
Line_1579	IT THE ENERGY FLOWSED A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1580	IT IS FROING BEHIND THE IS THROWING FROM THE MO POSITIVE SIDE AND IT'S FLOWING BACK IN TO THE MIN NO
Line_1581	IT'S THAT THE PART MINES SIDE IS FLOWING OUT ENERGY THROWING UP THE MINESE SIDE AND THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK IN THE US SIDE
Line_1582	THERE WILL BE NO ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1583	I NOTICE THAT ON THE SIDE IF ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE BOTTOM IT WILL AND THE ONES ON THE SIDE IT WILL LIGHT UP BUT IF THERE IS BOTH ON THE BOTTOM AND WILL
Line_1584	WE UM WE JUST EXPERINENT WITH A MOTOR
Line_1585	MOTOR IS RUNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS POWERIN
Line_1586	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1587	THER MEANS THAT UM IT RECHEVES THI
Line_1588	ENERGY MUST FLOW WITH THREE WIRE TWO TEN AND TWO THEIRS
Line_1589	IN THE MOTOR IT'S THERE IS A CIRCUIT DEER S MOVING
Line_1590	TER HAS ENERGY SO THE WIRE IS TAKING THE ENERGY AND PU
Line_1591	THERE SWITCH THERE'S A SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_1592	CH IS TOUCH THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE BATTER THE METAL SO THAT'S WHERE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL THEY DON
Line_1593	YEAH I THE HOLE ENTIMATELMAT IS TO SW
Line_1594	SWITCH CAN ON TURN IT ON AND
Line_1595	EARRING SI IT TURNS IS BADDED THE MOTOR UH
Line_1596	IT'S ENERGY FLOW WOULD STOP AND RECHRET
Line_1597	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ONTO THE M
Line_1598	NOTICE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE METAL IT'S THE RAINY WHEN YOU TAKE IT AL

Line_1604	THE SCIENCE CAN LIKE ENERGY SOURCE BUT THE ENERGY COMES DOWN AND IT HITS THE SOLAR PAN
Line_1605	IT'S THE SOLAR CELL WAS NOT BROWNIG
Line_1606	WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN UM IT DOESN'T COLD THE MOTOR STUCHE
Line_1607	THEY'RE RUNNING AND WOENE IT'S DARK OUT THE MORE IT STOPS WERE T

Line_1612	FERN AND THE TANELE IS MOLTING
Line_1613	UH FIRE IS LIKE THE FILM N
Line_1614	IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND IT
Line_1615	ENERGY IS IMPORTING BECAUSE YOU NEED ENERGY TO PU EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE
Line_1616	UH THE ENERGY ITS LIKE A FLU STEEL BY THE
Line_1617	UH
Line_1618	FOR YOU LE
Line_1619	IT IS NOEAN
Line_1620	THERE WAS NO SOUNDUT
Line_1621	IT IS BEARNING AND ON FIRE AND IT'S GOING TO MOUNT AND FIVE THOUSAND ERS
Line_1622	THERE IS SOUND ENERGY
Line_1623	SHE IS IN APPLE AND SHE IS WALKING
Line_1624	I CAN HERE A SOUND
Line_1625	I SEE A APPLEA CANDLE WOOD AND A FUELE CAN
Line_1626	IT WILL BE Y GOD
Line_1627	CALL AND APPLE WILL HER
Line_1628	BECAUSE THEY POWIT BOTH DO ENERGY
Line_1629	TENNO REPEATED THAT BECAUSE TABLE WAS TALKING
Line_1630	BEECAUSE THE GASSOND COAL BERN AND THEY MAKE FIRE
Line_1631	AND THE SOLAR AND THE WIND MILL DON'T THEY PRODUCE IT
Line_1632	IT WILL PUT HE DIE
Line_1633	HOW YOU MARIED T
Line_1634	UM IT WILL PRODUCE DISRE NOT YOU MARIED
Line_1635	BECAUSE THAT GIVES ENERGY IRON AND ARE YOU MARIED
Line_1636	MARNEY ARE YOU MEARET SOME MY SCOLE
Line_1637	OH MASIN I GA I JUST HAD TO TEST
Line_1638	IT IS A IT FILT A CURRENT OF ENERGY IN A CIRCUIT
Line_1639	ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE
Line_1640	ENERGY HAS TO BE FROLLING THROUGH IT
Line_1641	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1642	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1643	ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THIS ONE ON THE WIRES TAKES THE ENERGY GOES TO THE THEN IF FLOW TO THERE IN COMES TO THE TOE
Line_1644	THAT IS THE ENERGY
Line_1645	IT HAS TO BE FILLED THROUGH MANY TRIAL RECEIVERS
Line_1646	MOTOBLE AND TIMES OF ENERGY FLOW THEY'RE COME YOU TO THE LIGHT BULBS ONE LIGHT BULTH OUT AND THE OTHER AND THEN'T COME BACK
Line_1647	THREY THREE THREE
Line_1648	YOU AND D MORE POWER SOURCE
Line_1649	THE NIGHT BULBS ARE GAIN
Line_1650	THAT THEY GET DIMMER
Line_1651	IF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_1652	IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY Y
Line_1653	IF ONCE IT THEN BOTH GOES OUT ONE OF THEM GOES OUT THEN YOU HAVE TO REPLACE AND THE OTHER ONE
Line_1654	BECAUSE THEY THEN PRUSS AND PRUSS ARE TOUCHING TOGETHER AG
Line_1655	UM WHENCE YOU TURN ONE OF THE D CELLS AROUND IT WILL START WORKING AGAIN
Line_1656	IF IF TWO HAVE THE SAME SIDES ARE TOGETHER IT WOULN'T WORK
Line_1657	DON'T PUT TWO BATTERIES TOGETHER ON THE SAME SIDE
Line_1658	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO DAY REALLY BREAIGHT
Line_1659	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT HAS ONE ADERY BUT FOOL WIRES
Line_1660	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1661	THEY E CHIP THE OLD PATHWAY
Line_1662	OH WAIT PERSINAL ROWS FORWARD
Line_1663	IT IT'S CARYING FAR TO ACTIVE TO THE TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1664	I SEE I SEE IT'S GOING NOISE
Line_1665	IT'S HAD ISUREALLY
Line_1666	IT FLOWS WHEN IT STON FLOWING THROUGH THE OTHER ONES IT FLOWES THROUGH THE POSIT
Line_1667	UH CEIRVY GOES FROM OUCH
Line_1668	IT IS BEURNING NOT IT'S THAT BARNEY HAS IT ON IT'S BURNING ROUD EQUITK
Line_1669	THERE IS TWO PALE SOURCES
Line_1670	UM IT'S SHARING THE SAME POWER SOURCE IT YO EARIMET
Line_1671	THEY'RE SHARING THE SAME FLOWER OF ENERGYE
Line_1672	YES THERE IS TWO BUT THE BI T GIVES MORE ENERGY SO THAT'S WHY IT'S USED BRIGHT
Line_1673	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1674	PARALLEL CIRCUIT OND THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1675	THE TOP RIGHT PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1676	I GUESS EXPERIMATED WITH AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1677	THERE IS A BAR MAGNET DON'T A MAGNET AND A HARSH
Line_1678	MAGNETS MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_1679	MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO ANYTHING MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1680	MADE CONNERI FOUR AT
Line_1681	STICKING C ALLY FRIGERATOR
Line_1682	THE REFRIGERATOR IS MADE OF HERSTEELS
Line_1683	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL AND I DON'T HAVE MAGNET
Line_1684	PAINT RE E
Line_1685	SHE NEREATED THAT
Line_1686	WOOD AND D ALUMINIUM CHEESE
Line_1687	M REASON THAT IS BECAUSE ONLY CERTON ITUMS IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRO
Line_1688	THEN THE WOOD BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1689	THE STEEL IRON ANTHING THAT MADE THOSE TWO MUCH ERIALS WOULD STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1690	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL
Line_1691	I DON'T YOU A PICTHURE
Line_1692	THAT THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING AND ALUMINAIL IS NOT BECAUSE THE STEEL IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND THE ALUMINIUM S NOT
Line_1693	DILUMINIUM ALUMINIUMUM ALUMINIUM IS NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1694	BECAUSE NOT ALL METALS IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL BUT THE STEEL NAILS OR MADE OF IRON
Line_1695	IMEARON AND THE STEEL NAIL
Line_1696	UM MMM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1697	THE STEEL NAIL HAS IRON IN IT
Line_1698	THE STEEL MARS STICKING TO THE ME
Line_1699	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT HAS IRON IN IT OVER T
Line_1700	THE GREY WO ROCK OUT WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO IRON
Line_1701	IT HAS STEEL IN IT
Line_1702	IT HAS IRON AND STEEL IN IT
Line_1703	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL
Line_1704	UH STEEL
Line_1705	I THINK WE LEARN TO DY IT HAS TO STICK TO MAGNETS IT HAS TO BE MADE OF STEEL OR
Line_1706	HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_1707	A BATTERY WIULES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_1708	THAT YOU GIVE THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1709	IT'S THE SOULCE THAT GIVES THE UM LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1710	IF THEY CONNECTED TO THE D CELL THEY TRANS FOLD THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1711	THEY THEY YOU LIGHT UP IF IT HAS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1712	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE IT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1713	THE D CELL IS GIVING THE UH LIGHT BULB UM AND O THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1714	THE THE POWRE COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES TO LIGHT BULB AND COMES TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1715	IT GIVES IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1716	IT LIGHTS UP
Line_1717	IT MOVES THE OPESIT WAY
Line_1718	THE NEGATIVE
Line_1719	BUT BOTH OF THE WIRE GO IS ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THERE IS ONE WIRE GOING FROM THIS SIDE
Line_1720	IT WOULDN'T GIVE IT ANY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE COULD BE ANY GOING OUT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_1721	THE LIGHT BULB NOT LIT UP ON I CHANGED IT TO THE SIDE
Line_1722	WE'VE BEEN LANING LANGING ABOUT MOTLES AND WILES AND ONE THEY CONNECT THE MOTALE MOTION OF THE THING
Line_1723	THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND IT MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_1724	THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTAL IS WALKING AND IT'S MOVING
Line_1725	THE MOTOR IS WALKING
Line_1726	THERE IS ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT
Line_1727	THE MOTALE SALT'S MOVING
Line_1728	THAT IT'S THAT THE THE IT'S THAT'S IT'S OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S OFF
Line_1729	THE MOTOR STALS MOVING
Line_1730	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1731	IT'S IN THE CLOSED POSITION
Line_1732	NO WELL ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTAL BECAUSE T'S NOT TRAVELING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT DOES MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1733	THEY UHM THE SUN COM IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON IT IT GIVES ELECTRICITY TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1734	IT'S A AND THE SOLAR PANEL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR
Line_1735	THE SOLE PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
Line_1736	THE SOLO PANELS UM GIVING IT ELECTRICITD CELL CAN MOVE
Line_1737	THAT IT FORMS THE SUN SHINE INTO ELECTRICITY AND GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1738	IF THE ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NO SUN ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO ELECTRICITY
Line_1739	THE MOTLE STULBS ON ING
Line_1740	IT GIVES THE SOLAR PANEL ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTOL SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTOR ONES AND MOTHS
Line_1741	IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY TO GET TO IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY
Line_1742	MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_1743	BUT IT'S NOT GIVING THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TO MOVE
Line_1744	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTO ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_1745	WE HAVE BEEN LONING ABOUT SIELIES CIRCUITS
Line_1746	THERE'S A CANDLE AND IT'S LIGHT AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GIVING OFF HA ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1747	TO THE WAX IS BURNING BECAUSE IT'S THE CANDLE IS GIVING OFF HE ENERGY FROM THE FIRE
Line_1748	HE ENERGY LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1749	LIGHT AND AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1750	NO NO YOU DO NOT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THERE'S NO SOUND AND THENLY TO IT
Line_1751	GIVING OFF GIVING OFF LIGHT AND HEAT
Line_1752	THE SOUND ENERGY AND THERE'S ALSO FED ENERGY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE FED ENERGY TO MAKE YOUR HANDS MOVE TO DO THAT
Line_1753	IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THAT SOUND IS SOUND ENERGY SOUND ENERGY
Line_1754	FOD ENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY
Line_1755	I SEE I I GUESS CAN I SEE WOOD I SEE APPLES I SEE MORE WOOD AND I SEE A CANDLE
Line_1756	IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_1757	IT'S TURNED INTO EXOST AND EXOSTAL POLLUTE TALE
Line_1758	ONE IS ONE IS LIKE A LIQUID AND ONE IS JUST LIKE LIKE A LOCK IT'S JUST SOLID
Line_1759	IT WILL POLLUTE THE
Line_1760	THE GASSAMD COALS WILL POLLUTE THE AS AND THE SOL PANELS AND THE WIND M BINES WON'T
Line_1761	IT IT WOULD POLLUTE IT WOULD POLLUTE IT
Line_1762	WE'VE BEEN BILDING SILLIES CIRCUITS
Line_1763	THE D CELL IS GIVING PARAL FROM THE NEGATIVE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE INTO THE WIRES TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1764	THAT ONE D CELL CAN BE USED TO POWER MANY THINGS THAT AT ONE TIME
Line_1765	THAT THEY ALL ALL IN THE CIRCUITAND THEY ALL D L A JOB IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_1766	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE D CELL AND THEN MOVES THE THE PILES TO WHATEVER IS HOOKED UP TO THE WIRLES
Line_1767	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1768	THAT IT'S GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN COMING BACK INTO A D CELL
Line_1769	THAT LPROENS THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS A FLOWING
Line_1770	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE BATTERIES TO MAKE THEM LIGHT I MEAN INTO THE LIGHT BULBS TO MAKE THEM LIGHT
Line_1771	FLOWS FROM IT FLOWS FROM THE D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE FILM AND BAG
Line_1772	IT ONE PATHWAY GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1773	TAKE MORE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1774	IT GETS IT GETS LESS BLIGHT
Line_1775	BECAUSE ONE BATTERY IS RIGHTING TWO ELIGHT BULBS YEAH WEIGH IN THE ELECTREEN BUSH AND EVERYTHING SO YEAH
Line_1776	IT HAS IT'S ON PATHWAY
Line_1777	SO WE THEY BOTH ALL USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1778	THEY BOTH THEY BOTH ALL USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1779	THE LIGHT BULBS BECOME BRIGHTER
Line_1780	WELL THE SILIES CIRCUIT IT WOULD THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE DIM BUT IN A L LE CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE THE LIGHT
Line_1781	THERE WERE SWLUIES CIRCUITS AND PARELL PARALLEL WELL LEVEL CIRCUITS
Line_1782	THE SOME SHOW D ON PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY AND SOME HAVE TO OWN PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1783	WELL THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ENERGY AND THEY WON'T BE AS BRIGHT THAT WAY
Line_1784	WELL SOME SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY AND SOME DON'T BUT IF THEY SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY THEY WON'T BE AS LADY
Line_1785	WELL THE FLOW WOULD SHOW THE SAME FLOW SO THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE AS LIGHT
Line_1786	THAT SHOWING THE SAME FLOW
Line_1787	WELL IT'S SH IT'S SHOWING ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE HUSLE LIGHT BULB
Line_1788	IT'S FLOW FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE UH LIGHT BULB
Line_1789	BULL IT'S COMING OUT OF THE SIDE AND GOING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1790	WELL THE TOP ONES ARE LIGHT THE BOTTOM ONE IS NOT SO BRIGHT AND BUT LIKE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SHOWING THE PATHWAY ELECTRICITY THE TOP ONE'S BULBD
Line_1791	THE TOP ONES ON'T SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1792	WELL IT'S SHOWING THE SAME IT'S SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY SO YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH AS ELECTRICITY INTO THEM
Line_1793	WELL UM THEY BOTH HAVE TWO BATTERLIES NOW INSTEAD OF ONE AND THE'R PUTY BLIKE
Line_1794	ON THE THE TOP TWOB THEY WOULD BE THE BEST
Line_1795	UP ONES BECAUSE THEM ARE BRIGHTL SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE BETTER
Line_1796	UM SOL A UM AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1797	TO CITY IT A CIRCUIT HAS TO HAVE POWER SO CAN BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1798	A CIRCUIT HELPS S DO HELP DO ENERGY
Line_1799	IT IS AN A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONNECTED BATTERY AND OTHER WIRES
Line_1800	US AND THIS IT BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1801	THIS CIRCUIT HAS A PATHWAY WITH THE WASHER
Line_1802	IT HAS BOTH AN BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FALLS FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND INTO UM THEN IT COMES IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1803	IT'S FLING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY
Line_1804	I THEY SENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IN HE
Line_1805	TH I THINK THEY ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY LITTLE OTRICIT
Line_1806	N POSITIVE SIDES INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1807	THE TO POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1808	WHAT IT'S IF WE HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_1809	IS LESS ELECTRICITY
Line_1810	UH MORE THAN ONE D CELL IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTO IT FLO CLIP BERNS OUT
Line_1811	BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1812	IT IT DOESN'T GO WITH NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE AND IT GOES POSITOR POSITIVE GOES NEGATIVE AND POSIBLYE
Line_1813	TO MAKES IT TURNED OFF IS THAT THE BOTH D CELLS ARE THE POSITIVE AND THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE WITH THE NEGATIVE AND THAT'S MAKING IT TURNED OFF
Line_1814	JUST CLIP THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1815	UM ENERGY COULD TRAVEL FOR WIRES
Line_1816	THE BULBS ARE ABOUT LIKE IT GIVES YOU LIGHT SO U
Line_1817	WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THE SCIENCE THING ABOUT DIFFERENT IN OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1818	A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_1819	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
Line_1820	THE BULB WIRES DIS AC WE TICAN
Line_1821	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BACING WIRE AND INCACING WIRE
Line_1822	THERE IS E THREE TWO OR ONES PATHWAY
Line_1823	WHEN WE ADD MORE PULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND ER
Line_1824	IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT OR A IT THE LIGHT B
Line_1825	UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIGHT BULB SO YOU FIGHT AND B TO RICH TO LIGKHE TAKE THE LIGHT AND THE FRONT OUT
Line_1826	WELL HAVE BEEN DOING CHE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER
Line_1827	I THINK IT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1828	BUT I DISCOVER IT'S ELECTRICITY IS NOW CLOWLYO LIKE A LIGHT BULB IT WON'T MATH
Line_1829	I S NOT TOGETHER
Line_1830	NOT SO GREI
Line_1831	WHAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEN WASHES DIFFICALT LIKE THAT AND IT'S MIX SALT
Line_1832	THE REASON WHY THAT IS BARONY IT'S BECAUSE THE Y EATING THE WIRES THAT CO IS PLUSED UP
Line_1833	WAI IS THE RU AND THE FILLIMAT WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND PUT HERE
Line_1834	THEY'RE JELLY DING TO YOU PHLESE WE PILED OUT AGA FROM
Line_1835	WE CIRCUIT THE ICRIAILL LIGHT AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT AT LEAST HAVE TO BE ONE WIRE CONNECTED
Line_1836	THE WEIGH WE NO BUT A SERIES CIRCUIT WORKS IS AND GO WE STOP ING WE HAVE ONE WIRE AND THEN THE OTHER THAT AT ONE
Line_1837	WE HAVE TO D THE ENERGY JUST WASTING OUT INTO IT BECAUSE IT S NOR ELECTRICITY WON'T
Line_1838	WHAT HAS AN IS THERE IS NO LIGHT
Line_1839	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO SERIES CIRCTBECAUSED E
Line_1840	IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT IT'LL LIGHT UP THAT
Line_1841	WHAT DO I THINK THIS IS IS BECAUSE THE FLIMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTRO T
Line_1842	DLLY WE IS THE FILLMETRBAND YOU TURNS OUT
Line_1843	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FOUND THAT ONE IN THE CIRCUIT AND AND TO THAT IT'S STOP WORKING
Line_1844	WHAT IS BEING SHOES IT REPLACES A BATTERY BUT DIFFERENT NO ONE
Line_1845	DON'T I NOTICE HOW CELL ERONE IS THE RIGHT WERE LETTER AND THAN IS TOE
Line_1846	IT Y NOWATICE HOW THE LIKE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GO THERE AND THE THEOTHER HAS TURNED OWN RAIN AT ALL
Line_1847	IT HAVE THE NEGARTIE ADJUST NE
Line_1848	THEY ARE CONNECTING I DON'T THE OTHER CIRCUIT IS MORE THAT WON'T DYWHAT'SYEA
Line_1849	A THAT Y YEAH YEAH IS YOU HAVE TO GO A ANDEREAM
Line_1850	I I I GET WAIT THE MIXED
Line_1851	THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRIC SHED OF LOW STOPS GOING IS BECAUSE AND THE LIGHT BULB OUT
Line_1852	IT HAVE IN SIDE
Line_1853	THESE ARE MAGNETISOM
Line_1854	MAGNET TO USE MAGNETISOMS
Line_1855	IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPOSIT LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
Line_1856	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO METALS
Line_1857	THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISOM
Line_1858	IT HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF METAL IN IT
Line_1859	WHAT'S HAPENING HARE IS MAGNETS STICKING TO A NEIL
Line_1860	IT IS STICKING BECAUSE IT'S CERTAIN KINDS OF METAL
Line_1861	THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT
Line_1862	THE PAPER CLIP AND ECUESS THAT'S ALL
Line_1863	ONE IS STEEL AND THE OTHER ONE IS IRON AT
Line_1864	THE PAPER FLIN STICKS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK I
Line_1865	IF I TRY TO GET THAT TO STICK IT WILL STAY ON
Line_1866	IT CONNECTORS AND ITS STEED
Line_1867	BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN METAL IN IT
Line_1868	IT MAY HAVE THE SAME THING AS BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_1869	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISOMS
Line_1870	I THINK IT WOULD NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME QUODRAG
Line_1871	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISUM IS NOT GOING LET IT STICK TOGETHER
Line_1872	I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAN PART OF IT
Line_1873	IF IT'S ANSWER CONNECTS IF IT DOESN'T NESS IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S IT DOESN'T EITHER
Line_1874	WHAT IS SIMALAR IS THE SIDE STON'T CONNECT
Line_1875	WELL SI ATTRACT AND THIN ATTRACT AND THEN AND SH DON'T
Line_1876	IT'S GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS DOESN'T ANT IT LIGHT TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE SAME QUADRAAND THE UPS
Line_1877	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE CARS OND THE ERTH
Line_1878	I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT UH SHE'S TRYING TO FIND OUR WAY AGENST THE NORTH OR SOUTH
Line_1879	FRACTIONS BUT IF YOU PUT A MAGNET UNDER IT THEN YOU SPIN IT IT'S THE PARTY THING WHOLE KEPS SPINING AND SPIN ING
Line_1880	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1881	BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AND TY PUSHED BACK
Line_1882	IT'S GOING ONDRAYS A METAL AND A I PAPER CLIP
Line_1883	THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CIP CAN NOT REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1884	ONE SEES THE MAGNET DROP IT WELL UNDER THE TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET IS CONDUCTING IT AND HOLD
Line_1885	THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLE IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
Line_1886	UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
Line_1887	I NOTICE IT'S WHEN ITS LESS THAN ONES LIKE WHEN ITS ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER
Line_1888	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISOM CAN NOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH MADE GRAME T PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S
Line_1889	WHAT IS GOING ON A THICK PIECE PER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK AND AND THEN THEN NIBENES IT SO
Line_1890	WHAT'S ALL R IS THE AT IS WANTING TO PICK THE CUP AND E
Line_1891	ER LIT IS UP THAT THAT IT THAT S SIN THINGS TO
Line_1892	THE MAGNET IS MORE FROM THE NAIL AND THERE IS THE NAIL USES ITS MAGNETISM
Line_1893	BUT I CAN SEA ABOUT THAT IS IT'S ANY TIME METER MAGNETS ON IT IT REACTS LIKE
Line_1894	GOING ON WHERE TO SEE THE SAMETHING YOUR SHAME YOU LASTA
Line_1895	WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PIXTURE
Line_1896	WERE A MOVING BECAUSE ALLY WAS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN IT ON THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1897	I SEE IS A MAGNET AND THEN NAIL AND IT'S FORCE KEEPS ON GOING ONTO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
Line_1898	WHEN IT'S TO MAKE IT ON IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN IT'S NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1899	WHAT IS HAPANING IS TO MAGNETISOM RAYS OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IS MAKING T
Line_1900	IT CAN BE CAUSE THE MAGNETIC UM FOR
Line_1901	I THINK WHAT IS SHRING US IS TO THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_1902	MORALE L IS IT STUCK INTO A NAIL AND IT CONNECTED TAPER
Line_1903	THE MAGNET PAPER DTHEPAPER CLIP SOM TOP AND IT LIT
Line_1904	THE FORCER THAT THE STRONG ENOUFF
Line_1905	ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
Line_1906	WHAT ER PANTING IS LIKE AND TIME PRASSING THE WASHERS SCOEN
Line_1907	I'M SHYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROK UP THE ALL
Line_1908	IT'S GOING ON HERE SO WHEN IT HAS SPACERS WHEN IT ADD THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETS ST TOUCHING OTHER
Line_1909	THAT'S ALL RE ON TO SEE THE MAGNET SOME OF THE L IT'S FORCED ENOUGF
Line_1910	OR WHAT EVER DOES IT MAKES THE MATT MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
Line_1911	THERE IS SPREADING WATER
Line_1912	WHEN IT IS ADDED ONE WASH IT GETS R BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
Line_1913	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS MEASURED N SA TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WON'T TO CONNECT
Line_1914	BUT IT DOESN'T MIX THE FOREST AWLEAKER
Line_1915	THE F THE SPACERS MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
Line_1916	ON THAT ONE SPACE IT NO WASHERS TO BREAKE IT
Line_1917	UN BY IT'S FORCE
Line_1918	I NEEDAD THREE
Line_1919	BECAUSE BIGGER THAN THAN IT COMES SMALLER
Line_1920	WHAT IT DOES MIX THE FAST PAN WE CAN ONLY CARE WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONGER THAN USUALLY THE FOUR SEE
Line_1921	SIANE
Line_1922	H IT'S ALL ABOUT A CIRCUIT SAND
Line_1923	THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS RAPED ABOUT THE TOP FROM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY PICK UP THE R
Line_1924	WHAT'S PUT IN SO THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK COULD GO THROUGH THE FRUM BECAUSE IF YOU PUT UP THE WEIGH BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET TRIP TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_1925	THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS A MAG NEGATIVE FORCE
Line_1926	IT AS A MAGNET AND CONNECT AT IT CAN PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON
Line_1927	WHAT HAVE BEEN TO USE A TO SO THE ENERGY IT CONES
Line_1928	WHAT THATILLY TO SWITCHES SAHAND
Line_1929	WE LEARNED ABOUT PER CIRCUIT AND OUR WE FORGETING FIFTY AND I DON'T WEIGHT
Line_1930	MA WELL S BUT IT'S ENOUGF AN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IM CONNECT TO THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NOR COMPELL IT TO THE WIRE
Line_1931	ERALL AND ELECTRAMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SOLVE
Line_1932	THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
Line_1933	UH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1934	MAKES ME THINK IT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MIX IT TO GIVE IT TO MAGNETIC CORD
Line_1935	THERE HAVE BEEN THERE AND THE WIRES IT HAS TO AT LEAST CONNECT SOM TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING
Line_1936	THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A FERVET
Line_1937	UH WITH THE PAY HINT IS THERE IS AN EL B AND A OPEN CIRCUIT UH IT HAS TO BE CLOSE ER CUT EVERYTHI
Line_1938	WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S IN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
Line_1939	IT ARE ACCOMPLASCHED BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE ABOUND THE RIVET
Line_1940	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAPPED AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS PORCED
Line_1941	WHAT I DISCOVER IS WHEN I PUT N RAPPING THE MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE WASHERS STICK TO IT
Line_1942	BUT IF ANY ILL CRESE MORE THE LIGHT THAT HAS MORE THERE'S MORE
Line_1943	THE MORE UM WELL IF YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPEN TO AS THE STRENGTH IF IT'S GETTING THE MORE FORCE INTO IT
Line_1944	TO RELATES IS
Line_1945	WHEN YOU INCREASE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THEY LIKE WHEN THEY RAPED A INCE IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHES ADDS TWO BATTER
Line_1946	THE S'S ATATCHED TO THIRTY
Line_1947	WHEN I MINUSED THE LINE TO SE UM JUST ONES IFOR I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NO IT JUST PICKED UP FIVE
Line_1948	WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE WANTING TO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGNET ROMTIST ADD MORE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_1949	THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE VERCE AND CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES IT GOES UP TO
Line_1950	BUT I STAND UP OUT A LGRALF IS NUMBERESE
Line_1951	THE LIGHT AT THE LIGHT BULB UM CONSURTDS TO HUMANS
Line_1952	BY HOW THEY DIVE EFLUCTIONS THAT ARE THE WEATHER A BULB TO SEE IF THE PROD
Line_1953	UH IT SOMETIMES COULD HURT BE
Line_1954	THE BALL HE FLICK SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAM
Line_1955	BUT THEY REFLECTED HOW IT REACTS
Line_1956	LIKE MAR SOMETIMES REFLACT DIDN'T GO TO THE CAN SOME LIKE THAT
Line_1957	WHAT I NOW IS THE UM CERTAN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IN ONE SPOT
Line_1958	IT'S TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE LIGHT REFLACTS OFF THE CASHE
Line_1959	THEY BASE OFF AND REFLECT BUT TO OTHER STUFF
Line_1960	IT BOUNSES OFF AND REFLEX TRY AND IT S THING
Line_1961	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECT AND OFF THE MIDDLE WHICH GIVES SO THERE Y AND S RE
Line_1962	ONE SHE IS REFLECTING AND THE SOMNELIGHTE TWO METERS ARE IN THE MAR AND IT SHOES IT ON THE WALER
Line_1963	IRALL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR CIRCKERS
Line_1964	THE POUNSI CUP OF WATER
Line_1965	THE FLUSH
Line_1966	SOLADALE AND AND UM CIRCUITS AND ME
Line_1967	UM A STAYING COLOR
Line_1968	GIVES OFF LIGHT GREEN AND OR INCH BILLBECAS YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
Line_1969	IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT TO A PEARSON
Line_1970	WHICH IS THE PERSON IS TRI COLOR
Line_1971	WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLICTS OFF
Line_1972	THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND TO CHANGE COLOR
Line_1973	SEVAN IT LOOKS
Line_1974	THE LIGHT MS DRIFT S I DON'T ALL FALL
Line_1975	TURNING TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_1976	THEY LIGHT KEEPS ON ASSWERING OFF IF OBJECTS TO WITH THE COLOR BLUM
Line_1977	YEAH IT IT'S REFLECTING OFF IS UP ROUGH OR AT THE CLEAR
Line_1978	IT'S STRIPTURE IN THE LIGHE
Line_1979	IT IT CHANGE INTO THE BILDING
Line_1980	WE ARE TO SHINE SOME T WON'T BE AS OF OW LENGTH
Line_1981	SO THE LIGHT IS US
Line_1982	IT'S BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING TO YET INSTEAD OF BLUE
Line_1983	IT WAS AT JET TOPED ON THE MAGNSOMEING WELL THEY RE ON TOP A
Line_1984	WE WELL HOVE TO SUCTION IF THEY CON'TATS
Line_1985	THAT CHANGE THE SAME ER THE FILTER
Line_1986	YES THE REFLICTION AND THE COLOR
Line_1987	THE REFLECTRIVISE TO MIXING THE COLOR
Line_1988	RE MAY IT WILL TEN DARK
Line_1989	IT'S NOT USE TO THE COLOR BECAUSE IT SAYS GREEN LIME AND A S GREEN NOT READER BLUGH
Line_1990	BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO
Line_1991	IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED IT'S THE RED
Line_1992	IT E THE RIGHT
Line_1993	I AM DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_1994	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS WITH WIRES AND BATTERYS
Line_1995	TWO GREEN WIRES ONE D CELL BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1996	BATTERIES ARE A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT IT STORES ELECTRICITY
Line_1997	WIRES MAKE A CIRCUIT CLOSED
Line_1998	TURN AN OPEN CIRCUIT INTO A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1999	THAT THEY CONDUCT SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY TO THE TO THE BATTERY
Line_2000	I THINK ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WY
Line_2001	WIRES CARY OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2002	LIGHT BULBS HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_2003	IT LIGHT BULB S A
Line_2004	I THINK IT MEANS TO FOR LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER THAT IT MEANS LIKE A SEEDS ELECTRICITY TO LIGHT UP THE
Line_2005	THAT THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE THE CASING WIRE OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2006	IKE I SEE I SEE ELECTRICITY CAN
Line_2007	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE LI
Line_2008	THE ELECTRICITY IS BLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2009	THE END OF THE BATTERY IS FLOWING TO THE CIRCUIT WIRE OF THE
Line_2010	THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB GOING TOWARDS THE BATTERY TO D CELL BATTE
Line_2011	THE BOB DO THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_2012	THE D CELL BATTERY FLIPED OVER
Line_2013	A SIDE LAM
Line_2014	THE ELECTRICITY'S COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_2015	THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRES SO THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP INTO THE FUEL
Line_2016	I THINK THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT IF YOU TOUCH BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE SPACE
Line_2017	THAT WHEN EVERY TIME THE THE WIRES TOUCHES THE CASING WIRES THE BULB LIGHTS AND WHEN BOTH OF THE WIRES TOUCH THE BACE IT DOESN'T M
Line_2018	ITS LEARNING ABOUT
Line_2019	THE FLAG IS SPIDING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2020	THE BATTERIES GIVING ENERGY TO THE
Line_2021	THE BATTERY GIVES THE MOTOR ENERGY AND MAKES THE MOTORS
Line_2022	IT HAS A SWITCH MAKING THE MOTOR STOP
Line_2023	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BUS
Line_2024	IT CONNECTS TO THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPAN
Line_2025	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_2026	THE MOTOR IS ON IT MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2027	THE CLOSED CIRCUIT BECOMES
Line_2028	THE SWITCH HAS TO TTOUCH THE WIRE
Line_2029	THE MOTOR STOPS AND LE
Line_2030	THE SWITCH IS IT NOT CLOSE
Line_2031	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TIC FLOWS TO WIRE TO THE BATTERY AND THEN TO THE MOTOR
Line_2032	WHEN THEY GET SOLAR ENERGY THEY POWERS SO
Line_2033	SUN IS TRAVELING TO THE TO THE SOLAR PANEL INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE LIGHT SPIN
Line_2034	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKE IT SPIT
Line_2035	THE SOLAR PADL IS RECEIVING SOME LIGHT
Line_2036	THE FLAG WOULD STOP SPIN
Line_2037	WHEN NIGHT CLICK ON THE SUN THE FLAX SPINNING AGAIN
Line_2038	THE SOLAR PANEL IS NOT RECEIVING ER AND ANY ENERGY AND TO STUFF IN MOTOR S SPACE
Line_2039	IT IS SHOWING ENERGY TRANS FOURENT FROM THE WIRE TO THE SMALLER
Line_2040	WE ARE DOING SOLID ICE
Line_2041	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO BILD PARALLEL ON SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2042	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_2043	THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH POWER BY ONE D CELL BATTERY
Line_2044	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_2045	THE LIGHT BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_2046	
Line_2047	BECOMES IT COMES A
Line_2048	IT WON'T GO GOOD GOOD E IF WERE TO COME
Line_2049	I DON'T
Line_2050	ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2051	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS TWO PATHWAY
Line_2052	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS GOING IS GAIN
Line_2053	BUT IT BS HAVE TO POUCH INTO T AND TOUCH SERIES I DON'T GREEN
Line_2054	BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE LIGHT BULB HAS TO STOP AND GO WHEN IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB GET DIMMER
Line_2055	THE WIRES HAVE TO THE ENERGY HAVE TO TRAVEL LONGER THAN IT WILL S
Line_2056	BATTERIES
Line_2057	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_2058	I AM DOING
Line_2059	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING TO SOLVE THE STRINGS OF LIGHT PROB
Line_2060	THE STRING TO LIGHT THE STRENGS OF WATER
Line_2061	THE BULB IS NOT LIGHTING BECAUSE IT IS AN OPREN CIRCUIT
Line_2062	WEE MAGNET
Line_2063	BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OFF
Line_2064	THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOW ANYMORE
Line_2065	BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE MORE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND AND THEY BOTH DO
Line_2066	ON TOP
Line_2067	THE FIRST LIGHT BULB RIGHTS OUT AND THEN MORE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER
Line_2068	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOW
Line_2069	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2070	THE OTHER BULBS ADDS LIGHT BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IS CONNECTED TO THE
Line_2071	THE OTHER BULBS HANDS LIGHT
Line_2072	WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE TURNS U
Line_2073	BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AND WHEN THE OTHER BULB LIGHT TURNS OUT THE OTHER BULB
Line_2074	A L A BULBULBUH
Line_2075	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HELP MAGNETS INTO RACT WITH EACH OTHER
Line_2076	THE TWO BRAG MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2077	I THINK THE MAGNETS WOULD REPELLANCETAD OF ATTRACT
Line_2078	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_2079	TROPES BUS ATTRACT AND NEIC PAIRS DON'T
Line_2080	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS HAVE SALT ARE OR TO THEM
Line_2081	THE OPOSIT PULES
Line_2082	THE COMCANT IS WAITING NMORAL AND THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING
Line_2083	I AM DOING FINE THING
Line_2084	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2085	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS SOMETHING THAT'S INVISABLE AND WE CARES
Line_2086	MAGNETISM IS AND THE OR A E AND THEN IT ANY WANTS SOL
Line_2087	THE MAGNET IS IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_2088	THE MAGNET ONLY GOES THROUGH THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND NOT
Line_2089	THE
Line_2090	THE MAGNET IS IS ACTING WITH THE NAIL IS ALLOWING THE PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NAI
Line_2091	THE MAGNET IS INTRACTING WITH THE NAIL ALLOWING MAGNETISOM TO RUN THROUGH THE NAIL AND STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2092	COAL AS
Line_2093	MAG THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T RUN THROUGH THE NAIL WE
Line_2094	PROBABLY A FU CIRCUITS
Line_2095	THE NAIL IS GETTING MAGNETIC TIS RE CLIP STICK TO IT
Line_2096	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCES REMOVED FROM THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP FALL
Line_2097	IT'S SHOWING ME HOW THE MAGNETISM RUNS TO THE NAIL
Line_2098	WE HAVE TWO
Line_2099	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2100	YOU HAVE TO RAPID ON THE S
Line_2101	THEN YOU SEE HOW YOU U AND IT ALSO WORKS BY RAPPING AROUND THEM
Line_2102	THE RIVET IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE SWITCH IS ON MAKING IT A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO IT IS AN ELECTRO MAG
Line_2103	THE WIRES IS RAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2104	WHEN YOU TURN
Line_2105	TH THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE RIVET AND ITS
Line_2106	I DON'T FILL COLD ARE ULYBIG
Line_2107	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOES INTO THE RIVET
Line_2108	THE THE RIVET IS GETTING THAT IT'S ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT'S A GOOD H
Line_2109	THE RIVERT BECOMES MAGNETIZED AVAGS OF THE WATER
Line_2110	ONE SAP BE
Line_2111	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT TRAVELS
Line_2112	THE LIGHT BULB IS TURNING ON AND THE UH BOIYSE
Line_2113	THE I REFLECTS THE LIGHT ENERGY S MUCH E
Line_2114	UH LIGHT CHE WOOD THE WHOLLY DAM HALL UH FAR IT CAN'T GO
Line_2115	IT BOLUNSERS OFF AND
Line_2116	THE LIGHT BASES OFF THE OBJECT
Line_2117	IT PANSES OFF THE
Line_2118	THE UGLY BOY IT SAVIES REFLICT
Line_2119	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE THE IS REFLECTING IT TO
Line_2120	REFLECTION MAKES THE THE LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH THE METERS AND THEN IT HAS A STARE IN THE LIGHT
Line_2121	THE LIGHT GETS REFLICTED OFF THE MER AND THE MER MAKES THE LIGHT
Line_2122	THE THE REFLECTION OF THE PENSAL IS GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND THEN LOOKS P THERE IS TWO PENSALS
Line_2123	THE WATER REFLICTS THE PENSAL D THE IT IS QUITE TOME
Line_2124	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REFLECTIONS AND HOW THE LIGHT ST OF METERS
Line_2125	I AM COLD AND WEAK TO DAY THINK YOU FOR ASKING MARNE
Line_2126	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEING COLORS AND HOW THEY
Line_2127	THEY UM
Line_2128	THE LIGHT IS SHINING TO A DIRECTION
Line_2129	I HAVE WEAK AND SICK THANK YOU FOR ASING MORE
Line_2130	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEE COLORS HO
Line_2131	I UM COLD AND WE THE YOU FOR ASKING MARNE
Line_2132	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COLOR
Line_2133	THE LIGN IS ALL YELLOW AND ITS MAKING ENERGY OUT OF IT
Line_2134	RIGHT LIGHT CAN COME FROM THE SUN UHM
Line_2135	I COULD SEE THREE SOURCES OF WRIGHT LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2136	THE LIGHT IS SHINING INTO THE PRISM AND THE PRES IS SEPARATING THE LIGHT THE WRIGHT LIGHT INTO ITS CO
Line_2137	THE PRISOM IS SEPARATING THE WIGHT LIGHT INTO IT'S DIFFERENT COL
Line_2138	THE PRISOM IS SEPARATING THE WIGHT LIGHT INTO ITS EREAGINAL COLORS
Line_2139	IT'S DOUGH THE PRISM AND THE PRISM SEPARATES THE COLORS THE THE REEL
Line_2140	I SEE ALL SEVEN COLORS OF THE RAY
Line_2141	IT MAKES ITS VE COLORS OH
Line_2142	I THINK THERE IS EVEN COLORS
Line_2143	THE RIGHT LIGHT IS GETTING OBSORED TO THE RIGHT PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE ONE LITER IS REFLECTING IN
Line_2144	BECAUSE THE BALL IS OUT
Line_2145	THE WIGHT LIGHT GAS TURNED INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE WIGHT PART OF THE BULB GETS OBSOLRVED
Line_2146	THE RIGHT LIGHT IT'S GETTING OBSORVED BY THE WIGHT PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE BLUE ART OF THE BULB IS GETTING FLU
Line_2147	GOOD BOS NETH GIVE I BOS
Line_2148	THE WIGHT LIGHT REFLICTS OFF THE BLUE AND THEN IT MAKES THE PULLB BLUE AND THE WIGHT POT STATE
Line_2149	THE RIGHT LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE YELLOW BULB IT IS MAKING THE BULB YELL
Line_2150	BULBS ARE BORD TO PLAY WITH AND THE BULB IS MAKING IT YELLOW BECAUSE THE WA IS RISING ON IT
Line_2151	BULB MAKES LOW AND THEN BULB MAKES IT WIGHT BECAUSE THE WIGHT SPOT AND YELLOWS
Line_2152	THE PLOW FOUL MIS SURE IS HARE TO BLUDD AND BRED IS TURNING
Line_2153	THE BULB TURNS GREEN
Line_2154	THE BULB TURNED GREEN BECAUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT MAKES THE BLUE FILTER INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE YELLOW BULB
Line_2155	ONLY THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE THE LIGHMENT
Line_2156	THE LIGHT IS A REACTING OFF IT AND THE LIGHT IS TURNING UP
Line_2157	WHEN YOU SHIN THE LIGHT ON THE BRICK IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2158	YOU WOULD SIZE THE RED LIGHT OR THEY
Line_2159	WE CALLED THEM A D CELL BATTERY A BATTERY AND A ENERGY WIRE
Line_2160	BATTERIES PRODUCE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS POWER AND MOVE
Line_2161	THE WIRES AND THE CIRCUIT TRAVEL ENERGY THROUGH THEM TO GIVE POWER TO AN OBJECT THAT IT IS O
Line_2162	IN THE CIRCUIT WIRES CARRY ENERGY
Line_2163	SO THE BATTERY PA GETS ITS POWER AND IT LIGHT SO THE BATTERY IS LIKE A LIGHT
Line_2164	A RECEIVER MEANS IS GETTING AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING FROM ANYTHING
Line_2165	TO MEAN IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S TRAVELLING TO THE LIGHT FROM BECAUSE OF A WIRE ELECTRICITY WIRE
Line_2166	THE NEGATIVE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2167	THE BLUE DOTS REP ENERGY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2168	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2169	I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STARTED TO GO THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS CLOCK WAYS
Line_2170	UH DIRECTION OF FLOW TURNS TO THE OTHER
Line_2171	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2172	I NOTICE THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS WORKING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_2173	I THINK THAT THE ENERGY WOULD GO JUST GOING OVER AND IT WOULD STOP AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT
Line_2174	I NOTICE THAT AT FIRST THE BULB DID NOT LIGHT AND WHEN WE CLICKED THE BUT IN THE WHEN THE WIRE MOVED THEN IT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2175	IN SCIENCE LIGHTLY WE HAVE BEEN UM DOING CLOSED CIRCUITS AND OPEN CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2176	IT'S M IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THAT IT MEANS TO MO
Line_2177	IT MUST GET ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY SO THE WILL ME
Line_2178	THAT IT MUST GET ENERGY SO IT
Line_2179	THE BATTERY IS TRANSFERING IT'S ENERGY AND THEN IT MOVES SO THAT IT
Line_2180	NOTICED THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER WIRES SO IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY JUST STOPS SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_2181	THE THERE IS ENERGY TRAVELING FROM BOTH THE NEGATIV AND THE POSITERE SIDE TO THE TO SWITCH UP STICKY AND THEN NO REAL D
Line_2182	I NOTICE THAT I DON'T
Line_2183	IT HAS TO HAVE LIGHT FROM THE SUN SO THAT IT WILL MOVE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO LIGHT IT HAS NO ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR MU
Line_2184	FLAG IS TURNING IT MEANS THAT IT IS GITING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR PANEL IN THE SOLAR PANEL GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND THEN IT JUST LIKE MOSS THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2185	I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS SAVING
Line_2186	THING CAN IT CAN STIEL PRODUCE ENERGY ON THE CLOUDY DAY I JUST THINK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS ON THE BRIGHT AND SUNY
Line_2187	THE FLAG WILL START TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOL CELL AND THEN IT IT JUST MOVES THEND IT GOES
Line_2188	MAKES THE FLAG ME L
Line_2189	ST WHEN THERE IS NO SIN THAT THE FLAG WILL NOT MOVE
Line_2190	THAT THERE IS NO ENERGY TRAVELING FROM THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN W
Line_2191	I'VE BEEN LARNING ABOUT CONDUCTS WAS IULATIGS AND THINGS OR LIKE THAT
Line_2192	HAVING CONDUCTORS HELPS SEND ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR SO THEN IT TAPE BUT TO SPIN THE FLAG IN
Line_2193	IN THE CIRCUIT A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO POWER A MOTOR
Line_2194	CONDUCTORS ARE WELL CONDUCT THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE OR CONNEGATIVE SIDE SO THEN IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER TO SI
Line_2195	GOOD
Line_2196	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_2197	FOUND OUT THAT THE BRASS RAIN WORKS
Line_2198	IT PUT'S AN INSULATOR IND IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THE AN INSULATOR WILL NOT LET ENERGY FLOW THROUGH OR TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_2199	THIS THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS A CONDUCTOR AND ENERGY CAN IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGHIT
Line_2200	CONDUCTORS ARE OBJECTS THAT ARE ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THEM WITH AND THE MOTOR WILL STILL SPIN IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER WIRE
Line_2201	WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT PRESANT ENERGY
Line_2202	BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO MIKE STUFF
Line_2203	I DON'T KNOW WHAT FIELDS ARE
Line_2204	A CANDLE IT'S ON FIRE AND IT RELATS TO ENERGY BECAUSE IT IS ENERGY
Line_2205	OBSERVE WHEN I SEE YOU CANNOT BURNT E
Line_2206	TURNING CANDLE GIVES OFF ENERGY
Line_2207	NO I DO NOT HERE ANYTHING ONE A CANDLE
Line_2208	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER BECAUSE IT IS FOUL AND IT IS GETTING USED
Line_2209	YOU CAN SEE HEAT OR YOU CAN FEEL HE
Line_2210	ENERGY IS HAPINING BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEY ARE USING THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR BODY YOU PAT THE DRUM
Line_2211	SHE IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING ENERGY FROM HER APPLE AND THEN SHE IS USING HER ENERGY ON HER WA
Line_2212	YES YOU CAN HEARE THE DRUMS BEING LAID BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INSTRUMENT AND THEY ARE MADE TO MAKE NOISE
Line_2213	WE SEE A LOT OF SOURCES OF ENERGY
Line_2214	I SEE SOLAR PANELS APPLES BARK TREE PIECES COAL AND FOUE
Line_2215	THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BADD BECAUSE WE ARE RELEASING BAG GASSIS INTO THE AIR AND WE PUT BREATH IN THAT AIR
Line_2216	WE IT MAKES THE AIR ULFIT IT GIVES OFF BADDGACIS TO THE EAIRE AND WE BREATH IN THAT AIR
Line_2217	IT IS ALL DARK AND SMOKY
Line_2218	I SEE DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES I SEE GOOD ONES AND BADD ONES
Line_2219	THEY ARE SIMALAR BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT LEAVING BADD GACSES IN THE AIR
Line_2220	THEY BOTH PRODUCE ENERGY AND THEY DO NOT AND MEET THROW OH THEM PRODUCE BAD GASSIS INTO THE
Line_2221	THEY ARE SIMLAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO LEAVE BAG ACIDS IN THE AIR AND THEY THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCIES
Line_2222	I THINK THAT COAL AND GASS ONE DAY WILL RUN OUT AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE LEFT TO B
Line_2223	THEY WILL HAVE BADD BADD EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY PUT BAG GASSIS INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATH IN THAT
Line_2224	AND WE NEWABLE ENERGY SIRCES ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ONE DAY THAT WE ONLY HAVE THEM NO
Line_2225	I AM DOING GOOD
Line_2226	WE HAVE BEEN DOING BILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2227	ELECTRICITY CIRCUITS ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_2228	HOW ARE THE BULB TO LIGHT THE THE WIRES ARE FLUDDING ENERGY FROM THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE GO INTO THE THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2229	IS TO GET ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LIGHT B THE D CELL SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_2230	UM IT JUST GIVING ENERGY AND A TRUE WAS LIKE APATHWAY AND THE N
Line_2231	UM THE YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_2232	IN A SERIES CIRCUIT PATHWAYS THERE CAN BE AS MANY AS TWO UP TO AS MANY AS A MILIAR
Line_2233	MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET THIN
Line_2234	OUR D CELLS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT TO LIGHT BULBS GET LIGHTER AND THE WE BRIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY
Line_2235	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE WE HAVE BEEN BILDING PARALLEL A
Line_2236	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE UM THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT L
Line_2237	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE D CELL BETTER
Line_2238	THERE ARE FOR PATHWAY
Line_2239	I OBSERVE ENERGIES MOVING
Line_2240	COMPARED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE BRIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT
Line_2241	BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING MORE LESS TRUMS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL YOU'LL GET MORE
Line_2242	I'M WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2243	I REMEMBER THAT IT ALWAYSE GOES LIKE IN ONE SIDE AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2244	IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PA ER TWO PATHWAYS OR MORE IT MATTERS HOW MANY LIKE WELL
Line_2245	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLVING S
Line_2246	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE STRINGS OF LIGHT
Line_2247	UM TO USE UM YOU CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS MET
Line_2248	UM YOU CAN USE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WILL THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT THAT CAN COMPLETE THE S
Line_2249	BECAUSE THE I THINK THAT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THAT LIKE LIGHT BULB SO IT DOESN'T KEEP FLOWN
Line_2250	THE LIGHT BULB THAT IS BROK AND THE FILLMAN IS BROKEN SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_2251	THE ENERGY STOPS RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE FILM IT BROK SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH H
Line_2252	USO THE FILLIMI BREAKS AND ONE OF EITHER OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2253	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2254	WE HAVE ALSO SEEN UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL
Line_2255	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_2256	UM ONLY A NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLES STICK TOGETHER
Line_2257	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRID
Line_2258	THE NAIL AR THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE THE NAIL IS IRON
Line_2259	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAN OR THE NAIL IS STEEL OR IRON SO SO THE MAGNET ATTRACTS IT
Line_2260	ONLY IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2261	MAGNETS STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR
Line_2262	ON NAIL MUST BE MADE OF ALUMINIUM
Line_2263	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS CERTAIN KIND OF METALS AND THE OTHER NAIL MUST BE ALUMINIUM SO IT IS NOT ATTRACTING TO THE MA
Line_2264	IT IS STEEL OR IRON THAT WILL ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET
Line_2265	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_2266	I THINK THAT THE STEEL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE ALUMINIUM I JUST LIKE NOT AS STRONG THAT
Line_2267	I NOTICE THAT ONLY USUALLY THE METALS ON ARE OBJECTS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2268	I THINK IT HAS STEEL OR IRON
Line_2269	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2270	ITS STID
Line_2271	I THINK THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEE
Line_2272	UM WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS AND TO RA
Line_2273	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE EITHER TWO NORTH POLES OR SOUTH POLES FASING EACH OTHER
Line_2274	THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO SOUTH PULBES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO NORTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER MAN
Line_2275	THEY UM LIKE RUN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2276	IT THE MAGNETS ARE REREPELLING EACH OTHER THEY HAVE ED PUSHING AWAY FROM EACH
Line_2277	I THINK THIS MIXTURE IS THE CUP
Line_2278	M SHE'S TRYING TO SEE WHICH DIRECTION SHE IS GOING
Line_2279	AND BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MAKE THE COMPRESS NO WHERE TO WEIGH THEY'RE FACING
Line_2280	IT IS BECAUSE THE DICK
Line_2281	THE NAIL IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_2282	OH IT WAS RECORDING MEAN
Line_2283	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_2284	THE MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN
Line_2285	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MAGNETIC FOURCE IS WEAKER
Line_2286	THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_2287	UM THEY DO NOT HAVE STRONG ENOUGH FORCE TO ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO FAR APART
Line_2288	THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT YOU NEAD GETS SMALLER
Line_2289	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_2290	AN ELECTRO MAGNET IS A MAGNET THAT HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_2291	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUND THE RIVET
Line_2292	I NOTICE THAT IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IT INCLOUDES THE SWITCH BUT IT ALSO HAS A D CELL TO HAVE ENERGY
Line_2293	WITH OUT THE ENERGY THEN IT WILL NOT BE AN ELECTROMAGNET MAGNET AND THE RIVET WILL NOT ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_2294	YOU NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STOPS UM AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2295	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN THE ENERGY WILL JUST STOP
Line_2296	THE ENERGY STOPS AND THE MAGNET IS NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT ANYTHING ANYMORE
Line_2297	UM THE FLOW THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WEAR FOR ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_2298	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS GIVING UM ENERGY TO THE MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2299	I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SIT CAN ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2300	IT GOOD
Line_2301	THERE IS IT IS A A COMBONNATION OF ELECTRICITY AND A MAGNET
Line_2302	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRING AROUND THE MAGNET TO MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_2303	THE THE WIRES DTRAVED ABOUND THE RIVET AND IT ATTRACTS TO THE WASHERS
Line_2304	IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2305	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE TROW MAGNET IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2306	YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS NO WASH WASHERS ATTACHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE CLAY CLOSED CIRCIT
Line_2307	IT DOES BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS RAPPING AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2308	YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE BOTTOM THAT IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2309	IF YOU ADD MORE WIRE UP YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2310	CHANGES BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING AROUND THE RIVET AND IT IS GETTING MORE ENERGY SO IT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2311	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT TRAVELES
Line_2312	BECAUSE THIS LIGHT IS UMREFLECTING
Line_2313	YOU CAN IT REFLECTS IT CAN REFLECT AND KEEP CAN REFLECT ONTO SOMETHING
Line_2314	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF AND RAT IS REFLECTING
Line_2315	UM WITH OUT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DARK
Line_2316	IT REFLECTS OFF UM SOMETHINGS BUT SOMETHINGS THAT I CAN NOT REFLECT AS WEL
Line_2317	IT REFLECTS OFF THE OBJECT SO IT HITS IN THE RUN
Line_2318	YOU OBSERVED UM THE LIGHT REFLICT
Line_2319	CAUSE UM THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING AND D IS UM BAUNCSING BACK AT THE STODANT
Line_2320	IT CAN KEEP REFLECTING IF IF IT IS POSITION DRY AND UM THE LIGHT IT IS STRONG ENOUGFF
Line_2321	I THINK THE FLASH LIGHT WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LEFT AND THE CORNER STAR BECAUSE OF HOW
Line_2322	THE UM PENSL IS REFLECTING BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENSLS IND THE WATER BUT THEY REALLY IS ONLY ONE
Line_2323	YOU NOTICE THAT UM THE PENSAL REFLECTS OFF THE GLASS
Line_2324	IN THE GLASS WITH WATER AND IT IT IS REFLECTING AND THE WITH THE GLASS WITH AIR NO THING IS HAPINING
Line_2325	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT IS UM CAN EXPLAIN TO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2326	IT CAN COME FROM ENERGY
Line_2327	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE LIGHT LIGHT MAKES THE CANDLE GREEN BECAUSE WITH OUT THE LIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE ANY COLLE
Line_2328	YOU NOTICE THAT THE PRESOM SPRITS SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS IN THE WIGHT AND ITS DIFFERENT FORMS
Line_2329	SEE THAT THE PRISM SPITS OP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE LIGHT
Line_2330	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S PUTS INTO SIX DIFFERENT COLORS AND IT IS COLORS OF THE RED
Line_2331	CAN NOTICE THAT UM IN THE LIGHT BULB ALL THE COLORS ARE WIGHT AND WHEN IT SPLITS INTO THE PRPRSUM IT SPLITS INTO DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_2332	I THINK THAT SIX DIFFERENT COLORS ARE INCLUODED TO THE RIGHT LIGHT
Line_2333	YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS GOING TOWARDS THE BULB THAT IT WLIGHT LIGHT AND WHEN IT REFLECTS THE BULB THE LIGHT IS BLUE THAT REFLECT
Line_2334	UM THE EVERY COLOR IS ATWHIGHT IS ATTRACTING TO THE YELLOW BULB AND YELLOW IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB
Line_2335	IS THAT THE WRIGHT LIGHT IS ATTRACTING THE BULB AND UM THE YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTED OFF THE YELLOW B
Line_2336	UM YOU NOTICE THAT RIGHT LIGHT IS UM HITTING THE BULB AND YELLOW LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF FROM THE B
Line_2337	THAT ON THE BLUE BULB BLUE LIGHT WOULD REFLECT IT AND ON THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
Line_2338	YOU NOTICE THAT UM DIFFERENT CAN TURN IN TO DIFFERENT COLORS DIPENDING ON THE WITCH COLOR THE OBJECT IS
Line_2339	UM THE YELLOW BULB CHANGES INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE UM DIFFERENT LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS
Line_2340	COLOR CHANGED AND IF IT IS A DIFFERENT UM OBJECT THEN IT WILL NOT CHANGE A COLOR IF IT IS A CERTAIN COLOR OBJEC
Line_2341	YOU THINK THAT ONLY SOME UM COLORS LIGHT WILL CHANGED THE COLOR OF THE LIME
Line_2342	BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE UM EVERY OTHER COLOR BESIDES GREEN UM TO TURN THE LIGHT GREEN
Line_2343	THE COLOR RED BECAUSE UM THE BRICK IS RED
Line_2344	UM IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM IT DOES NOT NEED THAT COLOR
Line_2345	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN SCIENCE ENERGY
Line_2346	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_2347	D CELL BRY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_2348	UM THE WIRES COULD CONNECT TO LIGHT VARY I MEAN TO LIGHT BULB AND SHINING WITH THE BATTERY
Line_2349	WIERE PASSWAY
Line_2350	THE BATTERIES HAVE ENERGY AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE THINGS WORK
Line_2351	YOU COULD LIGHT UP ANY
Line_2352	THE SOURCE UH COULD GET ENERGY
Line_2353	THE PASSAS THING
Line_2354	WIRES CAR IN THE CIRCUIT AS THINGS HIT COU CARRY ES IN
Line_2355	LIGHT IS COULD MAKE ANYTHING SHIYE
Line_2356	IT MEANS THAT YOU TO LIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING B
Line_2357	YOU COULD PUT U SOME OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT AND THE BATTERY TO MAKE IT SHI
Line_2358	I SEE THE WIRES ARE ATTRACTING TO LIGHT BULB AND ABOUT D CELL BLENDY TO MAKE THEY LIGHT BULB
Line_2359	UM ENERGY FROM THE OU IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO WEI
Line_2360	IF YOU USE D CELL ENERGY WITH THE WIRES THE WIRES WOULD GET ENERGY TO A LIGHT PULB
Line_2361	UM THE POSITIVE SIDE UM GETS THE ENERGY END EN THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT GIVES THE ENERGY WILL LIGHT
Line_2362	THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES SO LIGHT BULL AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE WIRE
Line_2363	THE BLUE TS RE AND THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_2364	FLOW THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE TO GO TO A NEGATIVE SIDE T
Line_2365	ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND ONE OF THE WIRES TIPS WITH THE POSITIVE
Line_2366	THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2367	IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE ONE ONE WIRE HAS TO BE IT SEE THE C
Line_2368	THEY WON'T WORK IF THEY'RE ON THE BASE BUT IF THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WOULD WORK
Line_2369	IT MEANS THAT'S THE Y
Line_2370	ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MULB
Line_2371	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2372	IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2373	THE MOTOR WORK
Line_2374	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2375	WHEN IT'S OPEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T MOVE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_2376	IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO MORE
Line_2377	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2378	THE SUN HITS THE SOLAR PANEL IS END THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY TO BRICK
Line_2379	THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING SO THERE'S A CLUE
Line_2380	UH BECAUSE THE ENERGY CLOSED
Line_2381	THE FLAG WON'T MOVE BECAUSE THE SOLAR PANELS MADE SUNLIGHT
Line_2382	THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY AND THEN AKE TO THE MOTOR
Line_2383	THE MOTOR IS SQWITE
Line_2384	THE MORE WEAR WORK BECAUSE OF THIS SALT
Line_2385	THE SOLAR PANELS ARE ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM THE
Line_2386	WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH
Line_2387	THERE IS BATTERY WIRES A MOTOR A NAIL AND A SWIT
Line_2388	THE SWITCH AND THE NAIL
Line_2389	WITH THE PAPER CLIP THE WATER IS RUSH
Line_2390	IT WITH THE SPONGE IT WON'T OR
Line_2391	SOME OF THEY ARE MADE HRL AND COPER HER
Line_2392	SOME OF THEM ARE
Line_2393	THE MOTOR ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE THE STICK IS WOOD
Line_2394	IT HAS AN CLOSED CIRCUIT IT HAS WOOD BUT NOT STEEL THEN OR C
Line_2395	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S ROME
Line_2396	IT IT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS
Line_2397	BECAUSE THE STRAW IS RUBBER
Line_2398	THE BRASSWAIN GREAM WITH JUST LIKE COPPER AND COPER LIKE METAL
Line_2399	THE CIRCUIT STOPS THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_2400	WE HAVE ENERGY UM WE WON'T LUSE
Line_2401	A CANDLE
Line_2402	S THE CANDLE HAS ENERGY FROM THE FIR IS
Line_2403	YES IT WAS H
Line_2404	ENERGY ENE
Line_2405	THE ENNERGY IS LIKE THE SOURCE
Line_2406	YES I HERE LIGHT SO
Line_2407	IT STARTED TO FLAME UP
Line_2408	I COULD SEE U
Line_2409	YOU GET ENERGY BY HITTING THE R
Line_2410	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE YOUR
Line_2411	I SEE ENERGY THE THE APPLES THE CANDLE THE WOOD AND THE GASOLINE
Line_2412	THE IS GETTING THIRTYER YEAH
Line_2413	IT T YEA
Line_2414	UH THE SOLAR POWDERS ARE GETTING ENERGY AND IF TIRES IS GOING TO THE WATER UNTIL THE WATER IS RA
Line_2415	UM THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ENERGY AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ENERGY LIKE CAR YEAH UH
Line_2416	THEY NO WELL
Line_2417	CARS AND TRAINS USE GUESS AND COAL TO WORK
Line_2418	OH IT WOULD BEURN ON THE NEEA WE'RE GET IN FUMKY AND TO A
Line_2419	COR SHEREEDGS
Line_2420	IT IT EVER BECAUSE WITH SOME ENERGY WE WERE ALL DYING
Line_2421	IT'S IS THINGS THAT GO TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK WITH ENERGY
Line_2422	ENERGY HAS SCOL TO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THAT D CELL
Line_2423	THE D CELL HAS ENERGY THAT GOES TROUH THE POSITIVE SIDE SO THE
Line_2424	THE TALL ING AND FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING IN THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_2425	THOSE ARE THE ENERGY S
Line_2426	THE I DSS OUR ENERGY THAT GOES INTO LIGHT BULB AND END TO THE WIRES AND
Line_2427	THE FROM THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN FOUL FOUR
Line_2428	IT FALS THE BECAUSE
Line_2429	THEY'RE FROM THE WIRES IT JUSTIPENS ON THE WATER
Line_2430	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WON'T BE THAT MUCH BRIGHT
Line_2431	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL UN SHINE THAT MUCH ANDYMORE
Line_2432	THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD HAVE TWO MUCH LIGHT AND THEN SO THERE BE SO BRIGHT IN IT
Line_2433	UH IT'S TWO D CELLS ABOUT THE LIGHT BULBS GET UM RIGHTER AND WITH ONE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE THAT BRIGHT
Line_2434	THERE NEEDS TO BE A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE ARELLY U
Line_2435	SLATER
Line_2436	UM WE ARE ING A TBAIL ON SOLAR PANELS AND HELL
Line_2437	THAT DOES A SIRIES SH
Line_2438	IT SHARES IT'S ON PATHWAY
Line_2439	THE RE PARALL SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2440	THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEY SHARE ENERGY AND THIS SERIES CIRCUIT DO NOTHING THEY NOT HERE
Line_2441	PARALLEL AND SEDRITS
Line_2442	THAT'S CIRCUITS YEAH YEAH A
Line_2443	THE THE LIGHT BULBS CHORD BEAR AND OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOT OF ENERGY
Line_2444	THEY R
Line_2445	IT IS A PARALLEL UM
Line_2446	IT FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2447	YES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS WEARNING OUT BECAUSE IT HAS HO MUCH ENERGY AND AN OR OTHER ONES OF HARE THEM AND THE ONES ARE
Line_2448	THE TH ONE
Line_2449	THE PARALLE
Line_2450	C
Line_2451	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SIENCE PA WE ARE GOING UP A SIENCE
Line_2452	BECAUSE IT IS OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2453	IT WOULD E BECAUSE WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2454	ST BINGS OR LIGHTS ARE ING
Line_2455	SO THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSED OR IT WOULD WORK
Line_2456	THE LIGHT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_2457	ONE OF
Line_2458	THE ENERGY DOESN'T UM GO IT DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB ANYMORE
Line_2459	IT WEL
Line_2460	IT IS NOT AND IT IS A STID CLOSE CIRCUIT
Line_2461	I NOTICE THAT THEN MS ARE BRAKING BECAUSE OF SHARING ENERGY
Line_2462	UM UH IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT ON
Line_2463	THAT THE FIRST ONE IT'S IT SHOWS HOW IT BREAKE AND THE ONE SHOES HOW IT S
Line_2464	IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE UM IF THE ONE OF THEM IS BROK END THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB BON'T MORE BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS ON FUR
Line_2465	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BOMS IS THE ONE THAT S IT
Line_2466	E CONEXTS CAME BARNY
Line_2467	THEY ARE MAGNET
Line_2468	THE FULL STICK HE'S A REFRIGERATOR
Line_2469	IT COULD
Line_2470	THE MAGNETS STICK TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_2471	MAGNETS COULD STICK ONTO ANYTHING THAT'S IS
Line_2472	MAKE IT ATTRACT TO UNTHE MAGNETS US STEEL
Line_2473	A WIYE HI
Line_2474	THE BAGNET STICK TO IS ATTRACTING TO THEN
Line_2475	WATERS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL HOW H
Line_2476	THE MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS TO DO NA BECAUSE IT IS LIKE STEEL AND THE WOOD IS
Line_2477	ERS SIT ARE MAGNETS IRON AND STEEL COPPER NO THEIR A MAGNET
Line_2478	ELL IT INTO A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET I MEAN THE NAIL IS IRON OR STEEL AND THEN WHAT IS IT
Line_2479	THE BULBS HAVE IRON OR ALS STEEO
Line_2480	MAGNETS STICK TO IRON
Line_2481	IT STICK TO IRON NAILS AND MORE BUT NOT WOOD
Line_2482	SO NAILS CAN BE COERSL YOU CAN LIFT UP THE YOU CAN LIFT IT UP WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2483	WHAT DIFFERENT S ARE ONE OF THEM IS STEEL OR IRON AND ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE COPER
Line_2484	EACH NAIL ONE OF THE NAIL IS NOT STICKING UP BUT ONE IS
Line_2485	ONE OF THE N MIGHT BE STEEL OR IRON BUT ONE MIGHT BE COPER
Line_2486	UM COSIT YEAH
Line_2487	OH NO
Line_2488	I THEN THE STEEL FOR SHOES SWING RUN THROUGH THEM
Line_2489	IT THREE OF THEM DON'T STICK WILL OR DO STICK
Line_2490	IT WON'T STICK ON
Line_2491	YES
Line_2492	I THINK IT'S IS STEEL
Line_2493	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_2494	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OUT OF IRON A TIP OF IRON THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2495	THEY MAY HAVE IRON
Line_2496	IF GO BUT OR IRON MAGNETISM AND HELP THE WHOLE WORK
Line_2497	THE MAGNET IS STICKING ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS NORTH AND SOUTH
Line_2498	THE POLE IT'S GOING AWAY THE MAGNET IS GOING A
Line_2499	IT'S THEY FASING SOUTH NORTH OR NORTH SOUTH
Line_2500	IT TAKE COMES WAS NORTH AND SOUTH A MAGNET
Line_2501	I FOMKION BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTING A OTHER MAGNETS
Line_2502	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNET FIELDS
Line_2503	MAGETISIS A MAGNET
Line_2504	THEY ARE STILL HIKING TOGETHER
Line_2505	THE PAPER BETWEEN THE MAGNET THE CIRCOING AND THE PAPER CLIP THE STEEL
Line_2506	IT HAS TO WITCH FORLES
Line_2507	THE ONE HEY UM
Line_2508	THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING ON THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2509	THE NAIL ISN'T GIVING IT ISN'T GETTING FARSE FROM THER MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_2510	IT IS SHOWING YOU THE FIELD AROUND THEN
Line_2511	THAT MAGNET HAS THE FIELD AROUND IT
Line_2512	THE MAGNET HAS A FIELD AROUND IT AND THE ITS GOING TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2513	MAGNETIC FELS
Line_2514	IT WON'T WAR BECAUSE YOU NEED NINTY AND SO THE M THE P
Line_2515	THE FLIGHT IS SEPARATE AND BECAUSE THEY WELL GO TO NINTEEN
Line_2516	THE MAGNETS ARE WITH THE FORCE FOR GETTING THE SPACERS
Line_2517	THE S WOULD BE SEPARATE WOULD BE SEPARATE WITH LESS MAGNET
Line_2518	IT'S A BATTERY A SWITCH SOME WIRES A WIRE AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_2519	TIT'S IS
Line_2520	YOU WOULD NEED TO USE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR IT TO WORK
Line_2521	WHEN IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T WORK ON TO A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT'S STORES GOOD
Line_2522	IF IT IS A OVER AN CIRCUIT AND THAT MEANS IT'S TO FLOW OR ELECTRICITY WILL GO OR TO NO WERE
Line_2523	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T MOR BECAUSE IT'S GOING OFF TO MILL WORK AND THERE IS ALL MAGNETS STICKING ONTO IT TO THE NAIL
Line_2524	IT WILL WORK
Line_2525	THEY ARE D CELLS BATTERY AND THE WASHER A SWITCH A WIRE AND A STEEL THROUGH IT
Line_2526	IT ELECTRICITY THE CRIC THE CRICITDAL MAG
Line_2527	THE ELECTRICITY COLES SO TO MAGNETS AND
Line_2528	THAT'S THE ELECTRICITY
Line_2529	BECAUSE THE RIVETS IS AN ELECIT'S THEN A MAGNET AND SO THE ELECTRICITY IS
Line_2530	YOU SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2531	IT'S A FORENT TO SEASE THINGS EK
Line_2532	IT SOMETIMES IF THEY HAD TO MEATUR IT REFLICTS HOW THEY HAS YOUR EYE THEN YOU COULD SEE THAT LIGHT
Line_2533	THAT RIGHT REFLECTS TO ANYTHING
Line_2534	THE IT R FLIS OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING
Line_2535	IF THEY HITS ONE OF THE PERS IN A ROME IT REFLECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_2536	IN THE ROOM THE LIGHT REFLACES TO ALMOST ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WALL
Line_2537	WHAT IS HAPANING IS THAT THE LIGHT IS REFLICTING TO THE METER AND THEN IT'S GOING INTO THE PERSON Y
Line_2538	WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT THE PENSAL IS IN THE WATER
Line_2539	WHEN IT IS LOWERED INTO THE WATER UM THE PENSL MOES
Line_2540	THAT'S THE LIGHT IS SPEASHALLY BECAUSE THEY COULD MAKE THE PACE LIGHTER
Line_2541	THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISUM IS GOING FIRST IT'S WAY
Line_2542	THE LIGHT CO SO DOBRISUM AND AND IT'S RINBULBE COST
Line_2543	IT TURNED INTO A RAINBLE LIGHT COLOR
Line_2544	I SEE SEVEN COLORS
Line_2545	THEY ARE WIGHT AND THEN THEY SPRED ON TO WHERES
Line_2546	SEVEN
Line_2547	WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON IT O FLICK TO THE BLUE BULB
Line_2548	WHEN IT'S BOUNING OFF OF THE BULB THE BULB IS BLUE SO THE LIGHT IS TURNING BLUE WHEN IT HITS THE BLUE BULB
Line_2549	IT IS REFLECTING THROUGH THE BALL
Line_2550	IT IS SHINING MET ONE BAT THROUGH UP THE WROK
Line_2551	THEY CHE RED OR A STOCK
Line_2552	YES BECAUSE IT WOULD TURN TO THE COLOR THAT IS A RUSH DARKER
Line_2553	WHAT HAVEN IS THAT THE LIGHT IS THE GOING THROUGH THE FILTER THAT IS MAKING IT BLUE OR ELSO
Line_2554	IT IS TUNDREC
Line_2555	IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR SO WHAT
Line_2556	BECAUSE THAT IT IS
Line_2557	WHEN WHEN YOUCH HAD A CLIP ON THE GREEN OR BLU RED WORK BUT WHEN YOU CLIP ON THE RED ONE A
Line_2558	THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT WATER THAT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2559	A SOLUT
Line_2560	THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HO WE CAN MAKE SALT WATER
Line_2561	A SOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIXTURES BECAUSE ONE IDOM HAS DISSOLVED INTO THE OTHER IDOM
Line_2562	THES SOL
Line_2563	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS WOFH SALT WATER
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT IT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER SO IT STILL ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2565	IT IT'S ALL ADDED UP AND THE NO WEIGH
Line_2566	THE MASS IS GETTING GREIGHTER
Line_2567	THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND IF YOU ADD THEM IT EQUAS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_2568	THE WATER HAS GAINED FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT AND THERE FOR IT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2569	YOU CAN USE A COFFY FILTER OR YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT
Line_2570	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2571	IT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL THE SAND CAN NOT MIX WITH THE THE WATER BECAUSE IT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_2572	IT HAS TURNED INTO A MIXTURE
Line_2573	IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID HAS BLUNDED INTO THE WATER
Line_2574	YOU HAVE T DISSOLVE THE WATER
Line_2575	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT AND THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUT
Line_2576	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_2577	IT THE WATER IT IS DISSOLVING
Line_2578	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUT
Line_2579	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE
Line_2580	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTE TO A SEPARATE
Line_2581	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES
Line_2582	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE USING EVAPORATION BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE IT WITH A FILTER
Line_2583	THEY ARE USING A MAGNET TO TAKE OUT THE PANES
Line_2584	THEY ARE SEPARATING GRAVEL A ROCK WITH A FILTER
Line_2585	GRAVEL AND WATER
Line_2586	SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_2587	THE GRAVEL IS BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER USING A SCREEN
Line_2588	THE MAGNET IS STUCKING UP THE LITTLE PENS WITH MAGNET IDE
Line_2589	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN CA FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_2590	I NOTICE THAT THE WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS WERE IN THE MAGNET PICKED THEM RIGHT UP BECAUSE THEY'R MAGNETIC
Line_2591	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL GOT SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FLIT THROUGH
Line_2592	BECAUSE THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH IT AND THE GRAVEL CAN
Line_2593	THIS IS THE BEST FOR USING EVAPORATION TO SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE WA
Line_2594	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2595	TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU NEED A POWDER THAT CAN DISSOLVE INTO WATER
Line_2596	THE GRAY POWDER IS GETTING PUT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2597	YOU CAN WEIGHT WITH THE SCAIL OR YOU CAN SEE IT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2598	ONE SOLUTION HAS MORE GREAGH POWDER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2599	I SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE SCOOPS AND THE FIRST ONE AND THEN ONE SCOOP AND THE SECANT ONE
Line_2600	YOU CAN WEIGH BOTH SOLUTIONS USING GRAMS AND THE ONE THAT WEIGHS MORE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2601	A STEAIL
Line_2602	THEY DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2603	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS USUALLY HAVE MORE POWDER
Line_2604	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONES WITH LIGHTER
Line_2605	THE LIGHTER COLLAR SOLUTIONS ARE DILUTED
Line_2606	IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2607	I THINK IT WOULD TAST STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE POWDER YOU HAVE THE STRONGER IT WILL BE
Line_2608	IT WOULD TAST LIGHTER AND MORE DILUTED
Line_2609	IT WOULD NOT BE AS STRONG AS THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAY POWDER
Line_2610	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER TO THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2611	ADD FIFTY MILLITERS OF WATER
Line_2612	YOU CAN ADD MORE POWDER OR ADD MORE WATER
Line_2613	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2614	WE HAVE MADE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS AND COALLAID SOLUTIONS
Line_2615	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT TO THE WATER
Line_2616	THE ROCK IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FETHER BECAUSE THE FETHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS GRAMS
Line_2617	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2618	ONE CUP HAS TTEN PER TEN GRAMS MORE SOLUTE
Line_2619	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE SO AT THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2620	I WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2621	ONE HAS TEN MORE GRAMS OF SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_2622	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE OF THE SOLUTE THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS AND IT WEIGHS LESS
Line_2623	YOU CAN WEIGH THAT MA

Line_2625	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2626	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2627	SOLUTION BE
Line_2628	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2629	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2630	IT'S DISSOLVING THE SALT AND IT'S GETTING SATURATED
Line_2631	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED
Line_2632	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2633	THAT MEANS THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE SALT INTO IT
Line_2634	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED WITH SHIOGER
Line_2635	IT CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2636	THE SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2637	THE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2638	YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOL
Line_2639	THAT MEANS IT'S NOT SOLUTABLE
Line_2640	THE POWDER IS SOLUTE
Line_2641	YOU NEED A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT
Line_2642	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_2643	THE WATER IS GETTING SATURATED
Line_2644	THAT MEANS THE UM WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2645	THE EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2646	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURAT
Line_2647	THE THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT SALT
Line_2648	IT LEAVES SOME OF THE SALT ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2649	ONE OF THE SIZE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT
Line_2650	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_2651	EACH A SOLUTE EACH ONE OF THE THINGS A SOLU
Line_2652	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2653	SATURATING SOLUTIONS
Line_2654	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TOGETHER TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2655	IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2656	WE MIXED CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND THEN CALCIUM CHLORCITRIC ACID AND THEN FINALLY BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
Line_2657	I THINK SO BECAUSE BAKING SODA WHEN IT HIT WHEN IT HITS WATER IT FIZIS
Line_2658	WATER THE SOLVENT
Line_2659	THEY MIXED TOGETHER AND SEPARATED
Line_2660	THEY ARE MIXED TO CREATE A NO MOLECLUE
Line_2661	THEY WILL MIX TOGETHER AND CREATE A CEMICAL REACT
Line_2662	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2663	THE SOLUTION HAS LEFT PERIPITATE
Line_2664	IT HAS MADE A NO MOLECLUE
Line_2665	THERE HAVE BEEN PURPLE MOLECULES CREATED AND THE WATER
Line_2666	IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF THE WATER
Line_2667	I SAW
Line_2668	IT GOT COLD
Line_2669	THE MIXTURES THE TWO SOLUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT IT WOULD TAKE
Line_2670	YES BECAUSE THE PRODUCT TURNS PAM
Line_2671	IT HAS MADE A
Line_2672	SHE MADE A POP IN THE BOBS
Line_2673	CTION IT'S HALF AND IT'S GETTING RED
Line_2674	THERE IS A MICTHEBYA
Line_2675	WENT INTO
Line_2676	OUR TWO STICK AT
Line_2677	YES BECAUSE IT IS GLOWING
Line_2678	IT HAS MADE A CHEMICAL REA TAP
Line_2679	YES BECAUSE THE GRP THE WATER HAS TURN PURPLE
Line_2680	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OR CURRING
Line_2681	TO REACTANTS COMBINING
Line_2682	IF THERE IS A PRODUCT
Line_2683	THE PRODUCT IS THE REMAINING THING AT THE BOTTOM
Line_2684	BAKING SODA AND CEMIC CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2685	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2686	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL AND SOIL ROCKS AND LAM FORMS
Line_2687	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_2688	WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2689	I SEE LOTS OF CLAY FILL GRAVEL AND HUMANS
Line_2690	HUMITS GRAVEL CLAY AND SIELK
Line_2691	HUMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2692	THERE ARE THESE SOILS ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2693	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2694	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2695	SAND CLAY GRAVELE PEBBLES AND ORGANNRIC MATTER
Line_2696	ALL SOILS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT CLIMETS
Line_2697	THEY BOTH THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT BAIERIALS
Line_2698	THEY ARE SPREADED OUT THROUGH THE GRAVERL
Line_2699	THEY ARE SIMALAR BECAUSE THEY MOST OF THEM HAVE SAND
Line_2700	THE DELTA HAS MORE HUMINIESS AND MORE SAND AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A TINY BIT OF GRAVEL
Line_2701	IN THE DEL THERE IS MORE SAND IN THE DESERT THERE IS MORE GRAVEL THAN SAND
Line_2702	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCK SOILS AND DEFORM
Line_2703	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING SCREEM TABLES
Line_2704	THE SCREEM TABEL WITH THE SLOP HAS A BIGGER FAN THE ONE WITH OUT THE SLOP HAS THE SMALLER PAN
Line_2705	A RIVER THAT IS STEEP IT FLOWES DOWN A RIVER THAT IS FLAT IT GOES SLOW
Line_2706	IN THE ONE WITH THE D SNOW THERE THE WATER IS GOING FAST OR THE FLAT IT'S GOING SLOWLY
Line_2707	THE WATER ON THE FLAT SLOP IS GOING SLOW AND THE WATER ON THE SLEEP STEEP SLOP IS GOING FAST
Line_2708	THE FLOW OF THE WATER GETS FASTER
Line_2709	ONE TO GUM I MAKE BUBBLES
Line_2710	THE FLUD CONDITIONS HAVE MAKE MORE CANIONS THAN THE STANDARD CONDITION
Line_2711	THEIR ENOUGH FLOWD THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN IT'S SOPOSED TO
Line_2712	ONE'S FASTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2713	IT'S PICKS UP AND STAUDY'S GOING FASTER
Line_2714	IN TWENTY FOR S AND THE FLUD HAS TAKEN DOWN TREESE AND ROCKS FROM THE LAND
Line_2715	AN ERTH QUAIK
Line_2716	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS CRACKING BECAUSE OF WETHER
Line_2717	CEMICALE WEATHERING A
Line_2718	THE ROCK HAS SMACHED INTO OTHER ROCKS THAT IS CALLED FISICAL WETHERING
Line_2719	THE ROCK SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS
Line_2720	I NOTICE THAT THE ROCK CA WENT DOWN THROUGH WATER AND WAS STILL MOVING
Line_2721	THE ROUTS ARE BREAKING ARE GOING INTO THE ROCK AND ARE EXPANDING TO CRACT THE ROCK

Line_2724	THE WATER GOT INTO THE ROCK AND FROWSE AND EXPANDED TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2725	IT EXPANES AND
Line_2726	THE FRAISING JAR HAS CRACKED THE ISE BECAUSE THE WATER HAS EXPANDED
Line_2727	THE WATER HAS EXPANDED AND BROK THE GLASS
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE WATER EXPANDS
Line_2729	THE PILE OF ROCKS THE ON THE LEFT ARE PEBBLES AND THE AND THE ROCK ON THE RIGHT ARE GRAVELING
Line_2730	THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_2731	WETHERRCEMICALE WEATHERING
Line_2732	BECAUSE THE EL GRAVEL HAS HIT THE ROCK GOING DOWN
Line_2733	THAT ONE'S GOT ON SIS TE BE AND OUR FRAG LIKE PRE AM MR
Line_2734	GOOD BY THINK YOU I HAVE YOU WE I
Line_2735	AROSION
Line_2736	I DON'T REALLY GOT ABOUT THEM
Line_2737	THERE IS WATER WITH THE STEEL SAL AND THE WAR ON THE PLIF THAT IS FLAD
Line_2738	ON THE ON THE STEP SLOW THE WATER IS GOING FAST
Line_2739	I TOLED YOU ALL RIGHT
Line_2740	THE FLUD IS GOING FAST CAUSING MORE ARROON THEIR DIS POSITION THAN NORMAL INSIDE
Line_2741	DURING THE FLUD THE WIRES GOING REALLY FAST WHEN IT'S NORNAL IT'S GOING NORMAL SPEED
Line_2742	DURING THE FLOD IT IS GOING REALLY FAST
Line_2743	IT HAS MORE ENERGY
Line_2744	LISON TO MY IE
Line_2745	A VOLCANIC ERUPTION AND WHAT IS IT GOING PUERPICT
Line_2746	AND WHY DO YOU TAKE SO LONG THE TOP BACK
Line_2747	RAPID CHANGE
Line_2748	SLOW
Line_2749	IT WAS SLOW
Line_2750	THE LAND
Line_2751	U TAKE
Line_2752	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METERS AND HOW LIGHT CAN YOU REFLECT OFF THE
Line_2753	BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE COMPLEATE CIRCUIT FOR THE THE ELECTRO MAGNETISM TO BE INDUCED
Line_2754	THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET WHICH INDUSES THE ELECTROMAGNETS WHITCH MAKES IT
Line_2755	IT INDUCES A MAGNETISOM WHICH MAKES THE RIVET AND ELECTRO MAGNET WHICH ALOWS IT TO PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_2756	ITIT INDUES MAGISOM BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2757	IF THERE IS NO FLOW FOR ELECTRICITY THAT'S PROBLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING THE WHOLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2758	THE WILL OF THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT OPEN STOPS THE CIRCUIT OR COMPLEATES IT
Line_2759	WELL WITH THE ELECTRICITY NTRO MAGNET COAL NEVER BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ELECTRIC INDUCES THE MAGNET O
Line_2760	THE WIRES HAVE THERE HAS TO BE ENOUFF COILS WITH THE WIRE FOR IT CONDUCE MAGNETISM
Line_2761	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPING AROUND THE ER IT JUST INDUSING MAGNETISOM AND THE WEIGHT WHICH IS ALLOWING IT TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_2762	IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THE THAT IS A THE ONLY THING BESIDE MAGNETS AND MAGNET SIDE THAT COUN PICK UP MAGNET
Line_2763	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND MAIERS
Line_2764	THE HEAVY SEE THINGS IT LIGHT BALANCES OFF OF THEM WHICH IN THEY BALANCES BACK TO YOUR EYSE WHICH ALLOWS TO SEE YOU IT
Line_2765	WELL WELL IT IT'S SHOWING LIGHT AND IT'S BALNSING BACK TO THE ISE AND NOT STUCK IN TO BOTH BALANCE HAVE TO
Line_2766	IT BALANCES UH
Line_2767	UM YOU SEE SOMETHING
Line_2768	UM WHEN IT HITS THE OBJECT IT BALNSES BACK UH
Line_2769	THERE IS GLASS
Line_2770	LARNING ABOUT METERS AND S AND ELCTROUM HAGINETS
Line_2771	THERE L HOW LIKE THE WO RYGH THINGS SHINING AND THEM
Line_2772	WASH THE LIGHTS ON CANDLES LIGHT BULBS
Line_2773	THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH A PERSON WHICH IS BREAK THE LIGHT LIGHT OF TO EACH COLOR WHICH ARE ALL RE CLOSED SO THE RAIND BOB
Line_2774	UM THERE IT'S WHIGHT LIGHT THROUGH TO THE PER AND OUT IT'S THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2775	IF THE WEIGHT LIGHT SHINES THROUGH IT WAS EIGHT UNTOS WHERE CHRM TO ALL THE COLORS TO RAIN THEM
Line_2776	WELL YOU LIKE THING THE LE BULB AND IT'S BOALNCSING OUT AS BLUM LIGHT
Line_2777	ONE INSERIT'S GOING TO HITTING TO BULBS LIGHT BUT ONE'S COMING OFF EX LI
Line_2778	WHEN THE LIGHT THE WEIGH LIGHT GETS EVERY COLOR BULB BLUE IS OBSORBED SO THE BLUE CUPER FLOWS OUT
Line_2779	IT'S ONLY CLAR NOT GETTING OBSORBED BY HE BLUE BULB
Line_2780	THE LIGHT WELL NO IT'S NOT GLASS IT'S REFLECTING THE WALL AND IT'S COMING AT OF BLUE
Line_2781	SO OBSORVED WITH THE BLUE WHAT GISS GETS ABOUT AN REFLECTED
Line_2782	I SHU THE THE WALL IT'S THEY BOLNTSOFT AS YEAH LOOKED BECAUSE EVERY OTHER COLOR IS BEING OBSORVED PUT YEAH
Line_2783	THAT NOT ALL OF THEM THING THE BULB ARE COMING BACK
Line_2784	THE BULBS REFLICTING BLUE AND THE YELLOW BULBS ARE FITTING YELLOW HEIGHT
Line_2785	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FILTER AND HE AND THE A IS GETTING FILTER BY THIS REHED
Line_2786	THE NO CARDS PLACED BEHIND THE FILTER IT TURNS TO A BUT WHEN THE BLUE ONE IS IT STILL TURNS SPLIT
Line_2787	THERE'S ON DARKER IT DIDN'T BLACK FOLERE
Line_2788	SOME WEIGH THE RED BLUE LIGHT WILL NOT WELL ILL DON'T CHANGE THE CUP BUT THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHT
Line_2789	BEES THE SAME COLOR AS ART DORTH CUWIN ONE AS FOR BLUE GREEN AND LIGHT IT MAKES IT A SPRITER
Line_2790	BECAUSE IT'S GREINIUM GAS
Line_2791	I MEAN IT BLUE LIGHTS IT'S JUST USE THE SAME BUT FOR THE RED LIGHT ITCH
Line_2792	EN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND IGHT S ENDIMETERS
Line_2793	IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_2794	THEY'RE ARE IMPORTANT S THEY MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2795	VE BEEN LARNING ABOUT METERS LAST ELECTROW MAGNETS AND FILTERING LIGHT
Line_2796	ON THEY EACH OTHER SEPARET PATH A
Line_2797	IS A ER NO PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2798	PARALLEL CIRCUIT MECALS EACH NO PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE EACH OF THE LIGHT BULBS HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY THE SAME HERE
Line_2799	UM THEY HAVE THEIR UHM NA
Line_2800	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2801	I THINK THIS CIRCUIT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2802	IT IS A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH OTHER ON PATHWAYS
Line_2803	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH OF THEIR ON PATHWAYTHEY HAVE TO TH IT DON'T SHARE IT
Line_2804	IT'S A STE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2805	I THINK COULD STILL THEY WOULD STILL BE BRIGHTER
Line_2806	THE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ON TOP A MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE THEM
Line_2807	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT WELL IN THE RIGHT LAST ONGER THEN THE THE ONE WON'T
Line_2808	THE SERIGE CIRCTHE PARALCIRCUITS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER AND THAN SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
Line_2809	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MEANERS SLIGHT FILTER AN LIGHT AND TTROMAGNECE
Line_2810	THE STRING OF ALLY IS A BONCH OF LIGHT AND A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2811	THE THE S THE ONE BURNS NOT TWO
Line_2812	E BULB IS BEURNED OUT SO THAT ON THE ONE THAT STOPS BEURNING
Line_2813	WHEN THE ONE BULB BERUNS NOT THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT BURN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SHOWING THE SAME PATH WITH ELECTRICIT
Line_2814	UM WELL ONE DIES OUT THO THE ONE DOES NOT AND WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE IT TURNS BACK ON
Line_2815	WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE THE THE ONE DOES BECAUSE THE SAME SHARE THE SAME FLAG
Line_2816	UM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT NO SERS IT COULD SEE
Line_2817	IT IT IT STOPS GLOWING IT STOPS IT STOPS GLOW AND NO
Line_2818	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANY MORE ONE ONES BURNED DOWN BECAUSE THERE IS A WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_2819	UM THEY ARE ALL BRIGHT
Line_2820	LIGHT IT WAS LIGH
Line_2821	I THINK IT COULD COME TROM A LIGHT BULB AND OVER HEAD LIGHT
Line_2822	I CAN SEE A LIGHT BULB
Line_2823	THE LIGHT IS THE WIGHT LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH A PRISUM AND BEING BROKEN APART INTO THE COLORS OF THE RAIN
Line_2824	IT BREAKS UP THE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2825	IS BUING LAND ART INTO ALL THE COLORS OF BRAIN
Line_2826	I TELL US THAT NO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE LIGHT UM BALNSWERS OFF THE BLUE BULB AS BLUE LIGHT
Line_2827	MAR O THE UM BULL IS STILL TURNING THE BLUE LIGHT OUT OF THE WLIGHT LIGHT
Line_2828	IT'S OUNSING OFF THE BULB IS BLUB
Line_2829	THE LIGHT IS GETTING FILE INTO YELLOW I
Line_2830	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB IS YELLOW LIGHT BECAUSE THE BULB IS ATTRACTING THE YELLOW LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_2831	LIGHT RASE EITHER HITTING TELL OR WIGHT THE LIER IS T LIFTING OFF ILL ARE YEAH WE
Line_2832	AH MY UH YEAH
Line_2833	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COMPOTORS I MEAN ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2834	I HAVE NO AH
Line_2835	THEY'RE SHOWING PATTERON WITCH
Line_2836	O CAY HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2837	WE'VE BEEN DOING ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2838	THEY'RE FORMING THE CONSTULATION A RIRON
Line_2839	THEY ARE CALLED CONSTULLATIONS
Line_2840	IT'S A RIRON
Line_2841	IT RISES FROM THE EST AND SITS IN THE WEST
Line_2842	WELL THE ERTH GOES AROUND THE SUN AND SO IT I'S TURNING AROUND COMES
Line_2843	THE ERTH GOING AROUNT THE SUN
Line_2844	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTRO MAGNETS AND CIRCUIT
Line_2845	UM I AM NOT REALLY
Line_2846	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE BOIYSE IS
Line_2847	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_2848	LIGHT LET'S YOU SEE THINGS UH IT REFLECTS OFF THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE THEM
Line_2849	I KNOW THAT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF ANY THING SIZE THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
Line_2850	THEY'RE REFLECTING OFF THEM
Line_2851	THEY HAVE TO BE SOLID FOR LIGHT TO REFLECT ALL OF THEM
Line_2852	I NOTICE THAT THEY REFLECT OFF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_2853	LIGHT REFLECTS OFF DIFFERENT WAYS WHEN IT HITS A SOLID OBJECT
Line_2854	THE LIGHT IS SHINING ONTO THE BOY AND THEN ONTO THE MER SO THAT HE CAN SEE HIM SELF IN THE MER
Line_2855	BECAUSE IT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND SHUTTING OVER TO HIM
Line_2856	IT'S BEING USED TO REFLACT TO LIKE A SPOT LIGHT ON A BILDING
Line_2857	UM THE LIGHT REFLACTS BACK OVER TO THE FIRST MER
Line_2858	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE MEARES AND IT'S HITTING THEM SO THAT THEY REFLECT ON TO THE ONE OTHER ME
Line_2859	THE THE LIGHT HITS THE LAST STOP
Line_2860	PENSALS AND THE WATER AND IT'S REFLECTING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ITS BREAK
Line_2861	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING BROKEN
Line_2862	THE WATER THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE WATER TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE PENSAL ON THE LEFT IS BROKEN
Line_2863	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT HITTING WATER AND HITTING DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_2864	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND REFLECTION
Line_2865	THEY ARE ALL MAKING LIGHT WITH ENERGY
Line_2866	YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE CHANGING COLORS
Line_2867	A CANDLE A LIGHT BULB AND THE SUN
Line_2868	A PRISM BREAKS UP THE WIGHT LIGHTS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW WIGHTLIGHTERS CONTAIN HIGH LIGHT CONTAINS ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AND W
Line_2869	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE BALD TURNING BLUE
Line_2870	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_2871	THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THE YELLOW BULB AND TURNING YELLOW AND GOING TO THE SIDE
Line_2872	THERE ONE IS WIGHT LIGHT AND ONE IS YELLOW
Line_2873	ONE BULB IS BLUE AND ONE BULB IS YELLOW
Line_2874	UM IT HAS LIGHT AND YOU'RE BRAKING UP THE LIGHT INTO WRA
Line_2875	THEY TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2876	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE THINGS WOULD CHANGE
Line_2877	IT TENS THE LIGHT BLUME
Line_2878	YELLOW AND BLUE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS S WHEN THEY MIXED TOGETHER THER THEY KIND OF MAKE OTHER COLOR
Line_2879	SOME THINGS TEN THE SAME COLOR BUT SOME THINGS TEN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2880	THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER GREEN BUT THE RED AND THE BLUE WORK WILL MAKE IT LOOK THE SAME
Line_2881	UM WELL THE LIGHT CHAINS DIFFERENT COLOR THINGS DIFFERENT E
Line_2882	BECAUSE IT'S CREEN IT OUT LOOK GREENER
Line_2883	THEY TURN BROWNISH AND THE GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT AND TURNS MORE REDDISH AND THE RED LIGHT
Line_2884	RED AND GREEN ARE AND IT IS BLUE AND GREEN ARE ANY DIFFERENT BUT RES RATHER
Line_2885	UM BAD B
Line_2886	WE'VE WELL LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND CIRCUITS AND LIGHT AND THE COLAUSE OF THE RAMBOW AND REFLECT
Line_2887	AT NIGHT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH LIGHT AND IN DAY THERE IS
Line_2888	THE SUN GOES UP ON THE WEST AND COMES UP ON THE EAST AND COMES DOWN ON THE WEST AND THERE IS CONSTULATIONS ON THE S
Line_2889	THE CONSULATIONS GO AWAY
Line_2890	THE STARS
Line_2891	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT NIGHT THE NIGHT SKY AND LIGHT AND ENERGY AND ALL CIRCUITS AND STUFF
Line_2892	IT LOOKS LIKE THE MON AND THE HOW IT DUS
Line_2893	IT'S THE ROTATIONS OF THE MON
Line_2894	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE MON GOES AROUND THE SUN
Line_2895	UM DON WITH THE FIRST SECAND
Line_2896	WAINING CRESANT
Line_2897	IT'S ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE MILL
Line_2898	IS HER MOSTLY FULL OR YEAH THEY'RE MOSTLY FUL
Line_2899	I NOTICE THAT THERE LIKE THREE Q YEAH THREE QUARTERS OF THE WEIGHT FULL
Line_2900	CRESONTS ARE UM MOST THE UH NOT FULL
Line_2901	COLOR
Line_2902	THEY ALL PRODUCE LIKE
Line_2903	IT IS WIGHT LIGHT
Line_2904	THE SUN LIGHT BULB OR CANDLE STICK
Line_2905	IT'S PUT UP TO MANY COLORS
Line_2906	ALUM THE RAIN BOW
Line_2907	IT'S A RANDBOD
Line_2908	THEY'RE PRITY UN
Line_2909	UH NO TO ERY
Line_2910	WHEN THE WIGHT LIGHT HITS THE BLUE BULB IT TURNS INTO BLUE G
Line_2911	THE ONES HIT IN THE BALL IS STILL WIGHT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE BLUE
Line_2912	THE SAME THING JUST THE IT'S JUST YELLOW THIS TIME
Line_2913	LESS REFLECTED
Line_2914	THE ONE THAT HITS IT IS HITTING A WIGHT SPOT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE HITTING THE YELLOW SPOT
Line_2915	WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PAPER IT CHANGES THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT
Line_2916	CHEASO LIKE
Line_2917	THEY CHANGED COLOR
Line_2918	YES RJEIATRE
Line_2919	I DON'T KNOWIT TURNS BLACK
Line_2920	OF COURCE YEAH
Line_2921	HER PUT THE BATTERY ON TOP OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2922	A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_2923	THE PATHWAY GOES TROH THE WARE
Line_2924	LIGHT BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT TURN ON THE WIRES AND THE EL THE WIRES CARRYD THE ELECTRICITY TO PURALL AND LIGHT BUL
Line_2925	WHEN THE LIGHT AND THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON ITS BECAUSE THE ENERGY CIRCUIT POWERS THROUGH IT D CELL TO THE LIGHT
Line_2926	I SEE ELECTRICITY HEADING THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH A CHI
Line_2927	IT'S S FALLING IN THE MINUS SIGN AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN IT KEEPS WERE THAINING AGAIN
Line_2928	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A CIRCUIT THAT CONNECTS
Line_2929	ELECTRICITY FOO S TO WARD THE POSITIVE
Line_2930	ELECTRICITY AND HE'S OWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_2931	THE POSITIVE SIDE THE THE THE ELECTRICITY FLILLD TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2932	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE OPSIT
Line_2933	THE SINCE GOING TO THE ELEVEN SIDE
Line_2934	WHEN YOU CLIP IT IT CHANGES DIRECTIONS
Line_2935	I THINK YOU WOULDN'TI THINK IT THE UM
Line_2936	I A UH GOOD
Line_2937	WE'VE BEEN DOING ALLOW OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2938	THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS OF ALL THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2939	SOLUTIONS
Line_2940	ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ON THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
Line_2941	THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STIYING ON TOP
Line_2942	THE SALT WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERY THING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE
Line_2944	WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2945	THAT WATER US DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2946	I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2947	WHAT'S HAVPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HI ME YOU MAKE A MIXTURE
Line_2949	THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED IN
Line_2950	HER THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
Line_2951	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S PORED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_2952	THE SALT
Line_2953	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT
Line_2954	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
Line_2955	THE MASS IS INCREASING
Line_2956	ONE KIND OF GRAM PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS Y GRAM TOGETHER
Line_2957	SOLUTION
Line_2958	THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2959	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND
Line_2960	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATES
Line_2961	THINK MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TO I CAN WEIGHT TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND A LITTLE BIT
Line_2962	UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2963	SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2964	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2965	THE DARKER COLORD SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GREP STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
Line_2966	I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DIRKER COLARD CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUF
Line_2967	IT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_2968	IT WOULD TAST LESS FLAVER FOFL AND GREAPY
Line_2969	I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTION BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
Line_2970	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
Line_2971	BY MARY IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TO LITER
Line_2972	I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST AND NOT TRAINS WON'T CRECTY
Line_2973	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPESTALLY
Line_2974	ONE OF THEM HAS GRA MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM F SALT WATER SOLUTION
Line_2975	YOU CAN TELL THE SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT
Line_2976	THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS IN GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SAIL TOGETHER THE FETHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_2977	ONE HAS MORE SOLID AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2978	I THINK THE ONE WITH TOY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS
Line_2979	I FOUND OUT THAT THAT MY PRODUCTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGH A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
Line_2980	DO GRONADDING
Line_2981	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2982	ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIL
Line_2983	I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2984	BYE MARNEY IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TWO BYE-BYE
Line_2985	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND THAT SALT AND WATER MIX THE SALT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2986	IT RELATES BY MIX SAYING WATER WITH SOLIDS
Line_2987	WE CALL IT A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIXES TOGETHER
Line_2988	WE WOULD CALL THESE SOLUTIONS
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FILTERS OUT THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
Line_2990	THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS ARE GETING SEPARATED OUT OF THE MAIN PILE
Line_2991	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE'RE NOT JUST ONE JIENT MASS OF SOLID
Line_2992	THE SCREEN IS FILTERING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_2993	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY SEPARATED
Line_2994	THE SALT AND WATER
Line_2995	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2996	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND WITH THIS MIXTURE IT BECOMES A SOLUTION NOT JUST A MIXTURE
Line_2997	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_2998	WE ARE LEARNING THAT ALL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_2999	THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3000	A SOLVENT
Line_3001	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND IS BECOMING A MIXTURE WITH THE WATER
Line_3002	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECAME A SOLUTION
Line_3003	ALL OF THEM MATERIALS WEIGHT N DIDN'T ADD OR SOPTRACT THEY ALL JUST GOT ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3004	IT SHOWS US THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS KEEP THEIR SAME MASS WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3005	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3006	SOLUTION
Line_3007	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3008	IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE
Line_3009	YOU CAN FILTER IT OUT IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_3010	THE SALT WASHER DID NOT FILTER OUT
Line_3011	A SOLUTION
Line_3012	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3013	IT'S EVAPPORATING
Line_3014	IT'S LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE SO THE MATERIAL IS STILL THERE
Line_3015	YOU COULD LIGHT THE WATER EVAPPLR
Line_3016	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
Line_3017	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3018	BECAUSE IT SEPARATES THE TWO ANDGER AREA
Line_3019	MAGNETS AND SCREENS
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE SEED SEPARATES THE LARGE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN UM FIT THROUGH THE SMALLER HOLES
Line_3021	CAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THE MAGNET DRAWS ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT
Line_3022	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3023	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL WOULD STAY ON TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WHICH FALL THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3024	EVERY MATERIAL OTHER THAN THE SALT STAYS IN THE FILTER BUT THE SALT FLOWS THROUGH
Line_3025	TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENT OW OTHER THAN THE SALT
Line_3026	THE SALT WATER YOU EVAPORATE THE WATER SO THE SALT CRYSTALS CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND THEY TAKE UP A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3027	THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3028	HI MARNY YOU LOOK VERY PRITY TODAY NOT
Line_3029	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3030	YOU DISSOLVE A SOLUTE INTO A SOLVENT
Line_3031	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3032	LIKE IN THE GREY TASTIC EXAMPLE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE PURPLE THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3033	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3034	TAST COLORAND
Line_3035	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS CONCENTRATION AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE CONCENTRATION
Line_3036	THAT THEY HAVE MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3037	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS CONCENTRAT
Line_3038	LESS FLAVER FUL
Line_3039	ONE TAKES MORE WATERY AND ONE T IS MORE FULL OF LAVER
Line_3040	ADDING DIFFERENT IN CREEEN
Line_3041	ADDING OR TAKING AWAY WATER
Line_3042	BYE MARNEY I WELL MISS YOU
Line_3043	GOOD HOW ARE YOU BARNEY
Line_3044	THE DRINKS ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE DRINKS ON THE RIGHT ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3045	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIXED YOU CAN TELL E
Line_3046	YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE BALANCE
Line_3047	THE CONCENTRATION
Line_3048	ONE OF THE CUPS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER CUP
Line_3049	ONE HAS TINY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3050	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS SOLUTE BECAUSE IT IS HEAVIER
Line_3051	MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ONE WITH TWENTYGRAMS OF SOLUTE WAS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3052	THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND ASE IT GOES TO THE RIGHT THEY GET MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3053	THE MOST CONCENTRATED IS ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS TWO
Line_3054	THE MOST IS ONE AND IS TWO
Line_3055	B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SEE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3056	BYE MARNEY ILL MISS YOU SO MUCH
Line_3057	WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE MIXSTURY INGREDIENT AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS BY FILTERING AND SCREENING AND ALL WE SCIENTIFIC STUFF
Line_3058	IT FLOWS
Line_3059	IT THINKS
Line_3060	THAT SOLUTION IS SATURATED THAN SOLUTION BE
Line_3061	ONE HAS MORE DENSITY AND ONE HAS LESS DENITY
Line_3062	IT WOULD THINK
Line_3063	IF THE LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT'S LESS DENSED
Line_3064	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION GOES TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSED
Line_3065	THEY ARE CREATING A DIFFERENT SOLUTION WITH EQUAL CONCENTRATION
Line_3066	ONE RISES TO THE TOP AND ONE SINKS TO THE BOTTM
Line_3067	ONE'S MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER SO ONE FLOWS ON THE TOP IN THE OTHER
Line_3068	THEY PORED SOLUTION A FIRST AND SOLUTION B SECUINT
Line_3069	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION AYIS MO
Line_3070	BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION PLUS ANOTHER SOLUTION EQUALS A BIGGER SOLUTION
Line_3071	THE ONE AT THE BOUM IS THE LEAST DENSED
Line_3072	THERE'S SEPARAT IN
Line_3073	BYE MARNEY ILL MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I'M EXSIGTED FOR OUR NEXT NEXT LESSON
Line_3074	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3075	THE SOLUTION CORATED SALT WHEN IT DISSOLVED
Line_3076	THE CEMICALS AND THE MATERIALS CREATING THE SOLUTION MADE SALT
Line_3077	THE INGREDIENTS MADE A NO PRODUCT
Line_3078	THE MIXTURE CREATED GASS
Line_3079	THEY CHANGED TO FORM GASS AND SALT
Line_3080	THERE IS DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_3081	THE TWO MIXED TOGETHER AND THE MASS HAPPEND
Line_3082	THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
Line_3083	IT TELLS ME THAT EVERY THING ON ERTH CAN BE RE MADE OR DISTROIDE
Line_3084	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE LET THE GASS GO WHEN ONE CEPT THE GASS SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3085	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND ONE BAG IS CLOSE
Line_3086	WE WEAREN'T LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_3087	YOU'RE SEPARATING THEM INTO DIFFERENT PILES SO WHAT THEY
Line_3088	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A MIX
Line_3089	THEY ARE IN GROUPS AND OF WHAT THEY ARE
Line_3090	YOU'RE FILTERING IT OUT SO THAT IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANY
Line_3091	THEY ARE GETING SEPARATED SO IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_3092	IT IS IMPORANT BECAUSE IT SHOWES THAT IT IS IT GOT SEPARATED AND IT IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_3093	THEY DON'T THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3094	IT IS FILLTROWING OUT THE SAND
Line_3095	THE SALT UM
Line_3096	THE SALT GETS DISSOLVED TO MAKE THE WATER HIGHER
Line_3097	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND
Line_3098	YES YOU CAN GET IT OUT BY UH EVAPORATING THE WATER
Line_3099	IT CAN NOT GET SEPARATED
Line_3100	MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS CAN NO
Line_3101	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3102	THERE CAN BE LIKE H
Line_3103	RIGHT MIXTURES BY A SCREEN MAGNETISM AND DENSITY
Line_3104	THE ROCKS ARE GETING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
Line_3105	THE A MIXTURE
Line_3106	TO SEPARATE OUT THE ROCK
Line_3107	BECAUSE THAT THING IS MAGNETIC SO STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_3108	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY BE MAGNETIC AND THEY MIGHT NOT
Line_3109	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3110	BECAUSE PAPER BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3111	IT SEPARATED OUT THE WROCKS BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE THE SCREEN FITS IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK MORE EFFICIENT WEIGH THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3113	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3114	BECAUSE SAND CANT GO THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT WORKS
Line_3115	THE WORK BECAUSE ALL THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT WAS BACK T
Line_3116	IT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE SEPARATED NO OTHER WAY WORK
Line_3117	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE ALL DI GET EVERYTHING IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_3118	IT'S TRYING TO CHASE PROUVE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TOGETHER IT CHANGES IT'S PROPERTY
Line_3119	YOU ARE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TOGETHER TO MAKE A SAND AND WATER SOLUTION
Line_3120	THE SALT THE SALT WILL
Line_3121	THE SALT GOT MIXED IN AND THE AND DISSOLVED IN THE SAND DID IT
Line_3122	IT DISSOLVES TO SHOW THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3123	IT IS THE THING THAT IS THAT IS NOT GETTING
Line_3124	BECAUSE THEY THEY STAY TOGETHER ER AND IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED
Line_3125	THE SALT IS THE SOLUTE AND IT GETS DISSOLVE
Line_3126	IT IS THE SOLVENT AND THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO IT
Line_3127	A SOLUTE
Line_3128	IT IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND HEAVIER THAN EACH SEPARENT
Line_3129	WHEN YOU ADD IT TOGETHER IT ADDS THE GRAMS OF THE SALT
Line_3130	IT IS ADDING MORE WEIGHT
Line_3131	I MEANS THAT WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT HAS MORE WEIGHT
Line_3132	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3133	THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3134	IT'S FIFTY PLUS FIFTY PLUS FIFTY FIFTEEN AND IT SHOES THAT THE SALT KEEPS IT'S UN PROPER IT KEEPS IT'S ON WEIGH
Line_3135	UH SOLUTION
Line_3136	WE CAN EITHER SEPARATE IT BY EVAPORATING IT LIKE SALT AND WATER OR USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_3137	YOU'RE SEPARATING OUT THE FLOWER BY PUTTING IT IN THE FILTER AND WE OUR SEPARATING THEM
Line_3138	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3139	A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT BECAUSE THE SAND WAS SEPARATED AND IF IT HAD STAYED IN THE WATER IT WOULD'VE BEEN A SOLUTION
Line_3140	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3141	THE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED AND INTO THE WATER AND IT COULDN'T BE SU SEPARATED WITH THIS FILTER
Line_3142	SOLUTION
Line_3143	IN THE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE SALT OUT
Line_3144	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND THEN YOU EVAPORATED IT SO THEN IT IT IT WAS BACK TO THE THE SALT AGAIN
Line_3145	IT IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AGAIN
Line_3146	IT IS EVAPORATING H
Line_3147	IT WORKS THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION BUT B YEAH
Line_3148	ONLY SALT TO SHOW THAT IT WORKED TO SEPARATE IT UP
Line_3149	THEY ARE PERFICT SQUARES BUT SO THE SALT DIDN'T CONTAIN ITS SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3150	IT REQUIRES TIME YOU NEED TIME TO EVAPORATE STUFF
Line_3151	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A A SOLUTE FROM A SOLUTION AND YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT AND WATER BY EVAPORATION
Line_3152	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3153	A SOLUTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED HOW YOU MAKE IT AS YOU MIX SOMETHING TOGETHER
Line_3154	A SOLUTE
Line_3155	YOU CAN SEE BY HOW MUCH HOW THE DIFFERENT THE COLOR IS
Line_3156	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND IT IS DARKER
Line_3157	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3158	THE MORE COLOR IT HAS OR HOW MUCH OR HOW MUCH MORE POWDER IT HAS
Line_3159	THE MORE POWDER ADD
Line_3160	THE DARKER OR LIGHTER THAT COLOR IS
Line_3161	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3162	IT IS LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3163	IT WOULD TAST MORE FLAVER FULL
Line_3164	IT WOULD TACT LESS CONCENTRATED LESS LAPERFM
Line_3165	IT IS NOT AS SWEAT AND FLAVERLE
Line_3166	YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER SO WOULD HAVE LESS IN IT
Line_3167	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER SO IT BE MORE SPREAD OUT
Line_3168	ADD MORE WATER
Line_3169	BYE
Line_3170	WE ARE WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3171	ONE'S A MIXTURE ONE TO SOLUT
Line_3172	THE FETHER WAS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WAS GRAM
Line_3173	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN
Line_3174	WE HAVE BEEN WAIYING STUFF AND SCIENCE
Line_3175	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TWENT
Line_3176	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TEN GRAMS OF SO
Line_3177	THE ONE WITH TGRAMS WILL WEIGH MO
Line_3178	MY PRODICION WAS CORRECT THE GRAM SOLUTE WEIGHED MO
Line_3179	BECAUSE ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS THE OTHER HAS TEN
Line_3180	THE GRAPE ONE GETS DARKER AND DARKER WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED AND MORE CONE
Line_3181	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_3182	THE MOST IS ONE THE LEAST IS THREE
Line_3183	ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TO IS LEST CONCENT
Line_3184	YEAH WE ARE
Line_3185	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3186	YOU ADD A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN SEPARATE IT IT W
Line_3187	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3188	YOU ADD THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU C YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3189	THE FIRST ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND IT AND THERE FOR IT IS MORE DENSE
Line_3190	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER SO IT IS MORE
Line_3191	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THERE FOR IT IS MORE
Line_3192	HOW DARK OR YOU WEIGHT IT IS OR HOW DENSE OR HOW CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3193	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND IT THERE FOR LESS THERE'S ER MORE
Line_3194	THE DARKER ONES ARE A MORE DENSE AND THE LIGHTER ONES ARE LESS AND
Line_3195	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS POWDER IN IT
Line_3196	THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE SEN FILLS OF THE DRAK NEXT AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS AND IS LESS COLOR F
Line_3197	MORE IT WOULD HAVE MORE FLAVER
Line_3198	IT ONE TACE AS FLAVER FUL
Line_3199	IF YOU ADD MORE SOLVENT
Line_3200	THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES EXCEPT FOR THE WATER AND THE TOP RIGHT I GUESS
Line_3201	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3202	THE MIXTURE OF THE TRAIL MIXES SEPARATING INTO SEPARAT PILES TROCLITS NOTS AND RAYSINGS
Line_3203	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_3204	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TO DIFFERENT PILES
Line_3205	THE WATER IS SPLITTING FROM THE MARBLES BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN AND MARBLES CAN FIT THROUGH THOSE TINY SPACES
Line_3206	THE MARBLE SEPARATES FROM THE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN
Line_3207	IT TOOK OUT IDUM
Line_3208	THE WATER IS NOW CLER
Line_3209	IT EVAPORATES
Line_3210	NO
Line_3211	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3212	MIXTURES KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOLUTIONS MIXED TOGETHE
Line_3213	I HAIT YOU
Line_3214	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3215	MIXTURES ARE LIKE SOLADS
Line_3216	A FOSS SIENCSETR
Line_3217	NOT SO GOOD
Line_3218	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONSS
Line_3219	THE SALT DISSOLVED PUT THE SAND IN THE WATER AND THEN
Line_3220	THE WATER IS MIXING WITH REP TASTIC REP MIX AND IT'S MIXING
Line_3221	A SOLATES
Line_3222	I DON'T KNOW I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU
Line_3223	SOLUTE IS THE SALT
Line_3224	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3225	THE SALT IT'S COLDST
Line_3226	IT IS ALL THE WEIGHT OF THREE OTHER IOMS TOGETHER
Line_3227	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3228	A SOLEDE
Line_3229	TOLD YOU BEFOR IT'S A SOLVENT
Line_3230	BECAUSE THEY ARE MARNGY BECAUSE THEY ARE
Line_3231	GOOD BYE MARRY
Line_3232	WE'VE BEEN DOING A MIXTURE THAN SOLUTION
Line_3233	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALAOD THE PAPER CLIPS IS WOOD AND THE BE
Line_3234	THE SALAD HAS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THAT
Line_3235	THEY ARE MIXED UNLIKE THE OTHER PILES
Line_3236	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE SAND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3237	THE RAISINS THE EMINAMS AND THE NUTS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER BUT NOW THE NOT
Line_3238	THEY USE TO BE MIXED ALL TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3239	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND COLOR
Line_3240	YOU SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3241	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE SEPARATE NOW
Line_3242	WAR WE WERE FLOWTING HAD ON A PAISTAL
Line_3243	THE WATER IS NOW SEPARATED FROM THE SAND SO THEY'RE TWO SEPARET THINGS
Line_3244	THEY GOT FILTER DIDN'T THEY
Line_3245	YOU USED A SPESIAL TYPE OR TOOL TO FILTER THE SAND FROM THE WATER
Line_3246	THE SALT AND WATER DISSOLVE THE TER AN WATER DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS DUST DO IS JUST A MIXTURE
Line_3247	IT'S DISSOLVING SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE SALT
Line_3248	MYBE YOU JUST NEED TO I JUST NEED TO ASCK YOU A QUESTION
Line_3249	IT WAS FILTERED BY THAT BLUE FILTERING MACHINE
Line_3250	THE WATER WILL GET DISSOLVED
Line_3251	NO BECAUSE IT MIXED IN WITH THE WATER SO YOULD HAVE SO YOU CANT
Line_3252	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY TELL ME WHI
Line_3253	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODY
Line_3254	YOU SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODY PLEASE
Line_3255	WHY DO YOU CICK ME IN THE MARBLE MARNEY
Line_3256	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND THE SAND MADE THE UM AND THE SAND MADE THE WATER VERY VERY DERTY
Line_3257	CAN YOU REPETE MY CENTANCE YOU CICKED ME IN THE BARBULB
Line_3258	THE SALT DISAPPERS AND IT EVAPORATED WHILL THE SAND IT JUST SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND MADE THE WATER DIRTY
Line_3259	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT LIKE THE GRAPE STUFF UM IT LIKE THAT IT'S A THE E
Line_3260	THE SALT DISSOLVES UNLIKE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE SAND AND WATER IT LIKE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND MAKES THE WATER ALL DIRTY I HEAT YOUR FACE BARNEY
Line_3261	THEY'RE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY EQUAL FIFTY GRAM
Line_3262	THE SALT ADDED WEIGHT TO THE WATER SO OUNCE SIXTY FIVE GRAMS RATHER THAN FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3263	THAT IF YOU STILL CAN SEE IT YOU STILL HADD WEIGHT TO IT DON'T YOU
Line_3264	SOME OF THEM DISSOLVE LIKE THE SALT AND SOME OF THEM DON'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SAND
Line_3265	THEY ALL GOT MIXED TOGETHER SO NOW IT'S A WHOLE MIXTURE
Line_3266	ASS IS GETTING MARGE BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING THREE DIFFERENT THING
Line_3267	THE FIFTY GRAMS IS EQUAL TO ONE CUP L OF UM WATER
Line_3268	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL MEY THE ANSWER
Line_3269	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FILTER
Line_3270	THE FLOWER MIXED WITH THE WATER CAN BE FILTERD SO THE WATER AND THE FLOWER CAN BE SEPARATED AGAIN
Line_3271	THIS MEANS THAT UM IT STILL IN A MIXTURE SO THE SALT IS STILL IN THE WATER
Line_3272	THE CITRIC ACID CAN NOT BE FILTERED OUT
Line_3273	AFTER THE DISE IT'S UM THE WATER DISSOLVED AND NOW THEY HAVE THESE SALT QUIT
Line_3274	THE WATER IS GON AND THE SALT IS STILL THERE EVEN THO WE CAN'T SEE IT IN THE MIXTURE
Line_3275	YOU CAN FILTER OUT THE SALT FROM THE WATER
Line_3276	THAT OVER TIME THE WATER EVAPORATES AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AND SQUARES NOT CRYSTAL
Line_3277	THE EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SALT AND WATER
Line_3278	IT'S BY UM FRAND EM VERY IGNERRENT OR IS HE NOT IT HE IS SITTING RIGHT NEXT
Line_3279	MIXTURES IN SOME TO
Line_3280	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBLES AND WATER
Line_3281	I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS ONE BECAUSE UM YO IT'S A VERY EFISENT WEIGHTER
Line_3282	AY MARNEY ARE YOU TI
Line_3283	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE SAND
Line_3284	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE S
Line_3285	BRING A MAGNET TO GET ALL THE UM THE PAPER CLIPS OUT SO FROM THE SAND AND SIDE
Line_3286	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE SAND AND WATER
Line_3287	I'M TALKING TO A WOMEN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAT
Line_3288	THIS IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE CORREC
Line_3289	THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETS
Line_3290	IT'S NOT TWELY ONE MORNY BECAUSE UM WAS OVEN ERS
Line_3291	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3292	YOU USE THE UM COPY FILTER TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SA
Line_3293	SALT WATER DISSOLVE OUNCE THE SALT PIECE
Line_3294	THE SALT WATER IS EVAPORATING SO THE SALT IS BAG
Line_3295	YOU PUT THE SALT WATER IN THAT MAKE A BUBER AND NO IT'S THE SALT THE WATER DISSOLVED SO
Line_3296	ABOUT HOW EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE A SOLUTIN
Line_3297	THAT OR ARE Y NOT
Line_3298	I FIELL VERY TIRE
Line_3299	WE'VE BEEN BEEN TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE MARNEY
Line_3300	USING A FILTER
Line_3301	THEY RE ON'T THE SIDE
Line_3302	ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTE SHONS
Line_3303	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTE
Line_3304	THE GRAPE TACSTICK THAT'S WOULDN'T CO
Line_3305	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3306	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3307	THE DARKER ONE HAS THE M MOST SOLUTION IN I
Line_3308	THE DARKER COLOR SOLUTIONS YOU CAN VEARALLY SEE THROUGH THEM THE LIGHTER COLOR SOLUTIONS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM VERY ESLLY
Line_3309	YOU PUT A SAL FOR ME PLEASE
Line_3310	ONE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND FIVE SPONFULS AND ONE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND ONE SPONFUL
Line_3311	IT WOULD TAST A LOT MORE UM FLAVER HAS A LOT MORE FLAVER IN IT THAN THE ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3312	THE ONE WITH SIX SPONFULS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THEN THE THAN THE ONE WITH THREE SPOONS
Line_3313	IT WOULD TAST VERY WATER
Line_3314	I E TO DO MARNEY
Line_3315	I'M DOING GOOD MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_3316	WE HAVE BEEN DOING ANYTHING INTRESTING IN SIENCE
Line_3317	THE GREY MIX IS PURPLE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS CLEAR THE SALT IS TRAMTRANSPARENT
Line_3318	UM YOU CAN BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_3319	THE FETHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINY GRAMS THE ROCK IS GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3320	OTHER WEIGHS LESS THAN THE ROCK
Line_3321	MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT MARNEY THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3322	ONE HAS GRAMS ONE HAS TEN GRAMS SO ONE GRAMS WILL BE HEAVIER
Line_3323	THE SALT WATER LOOKS THE SAME AND THE GREY MIX ARE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_3324	THEY ARE ALL UM NOT EVEN
Line_3325	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3326	I HAT YOU MARNEY SO MUCH IT'S TIME TO CREEPY BUT YOU HELD ME A SCIENCE SO THINGS
Line_3327	I FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING THEY BULB I'M STICKING
Line_3328	LEARNING ABOUT NO CELL AND MISSLES
Line_3329	IT THE L
Line_3330	IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT POWDER ON THE LEFT IS MIXED IN WITH THAT WATER
Line_3331	YOU MIX SOMETHING WITH THE WASHER THAT MAKES US HA HEAVY
Line_3332	YOU MIX THE SALT WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3333	THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT SO IT'S SETALING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_3334	THE EROSION SALTS FOR EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_3335	EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTUM
Line_3336	THE SALT EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM SO THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE
Line_3337	THE WATER IS SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE WATER OR SALT
Line_3338	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_3339	THE SALT SOLUTION IS SIXTY SEVAN GRAMS WHICH SO IT MEANS THE SALT IS SEVENTEEN GRAMS IN THERE
Line_3340	SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS OF UM SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS IS LEVELE WITH THE SOLUTE
Line_3341	GOOD I FILL A GREAT MARTY BUT NO
Line_3342	BUT MY OBNOCIUES FRENDS JAIN AND ERUM KEE TALKING SO I CAN'T TELL A I'M SORY MARNEY
Line_3343	YOU PUT SHOT CITRIC ACID AND EM EPSOM SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3344	YOU ARE MIXING THE CICTRIC ACID AND IT MBROSOM SALT TOGETHER
Line_3345	THE WATER IS SO SATURATED NON NON OF NO MORE EPSOM SALT OR CITRIC ACID CAN GO IN
Line_3346	THE SHOGAR IT WEIGHTS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE EPSOM SALT AND THE CITRIC ACID
Line_3347	I GET THE MOES LIKE UM GOT TO B LIKE R
Line_3348	I DON'T KNOW BUT CELL ONES ON IT N'S GET A CA
Line_3349	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS MARNEY BUT IT SAYS LIL CHUREN
Line_3350	IT'S A SATURATED WE'RE DING I OR SO LEFT OVER SO IN YOU HAVE TO FILL IT TO IT DON'T GA
Line_3351	I THINK IT'S ACSIDENTE SORITY
Line_3352	IT'S CROSSING THE MOFF ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFY TRATON ON WASHERS
Line_3353	THE EEROUM SALT IS LIKE
Line_3354	GOOD IT'S OLUAN
Line_3355	I THINK EPROSOM SALT IS ON THE DISC
Line_3356	WHEN YOU PUT VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA TOGETHER THEY'RE THEY MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH MAKES IT ALL BUBBLY
Line_3357	THE PRODUCT
Line_3358	THE CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3359	THE CONTRACT OR SOMETHING
Line_3360	YOU MIXED ALL F THEM TOGETHER
Line_3361	THEY'RE JUST MIING OF WATER
Line_3362	AT'S WATER WITH THE BAKING SODA IS LIKE UM FISING
Line_3363	THEY'RE BLUE WIGHT AND SILVER
Line_3364	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT ATOMS
Line_3365	THE BAKING SODAS ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE VINEGAR HAS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT
Line_3366	NO THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
Line_3367	MEANS THEY MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3368	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3369	A MIXTURE OF BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3370	PARTICIPATE BUT TEN
Line_3371	WHEN YOU PUT SODIUM HOLK SIDE AND FIFTAND FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH HIDROLLIC ACID IT DOESN'T DO ANY THING
Line_3372	WHAT ARE THE PURPLE ADDOMS
Line_3373	TWO OF THEM ARE PURPLE THEY ALL USE TO BE BLUE
Line_3374	YOU CAN UM DISSOLVE IT YOU PUT IT OUT ON THE TRAY AND IT DISSOLVES SO YOU CAN FIND THE ATTUM
Line_3375	IT GOT THE WATERY ON THE OUT SIDE TWO
Line_3376	YOU HAD CALCIUM CHLORAID AT THE BOTTOM WHAT HOW YOU COULD STICK
Line_3377	THE CARBONATED WATERS SO CARBONATED THAT IT IT CAN STOP MOVING WITH THE CARBONATE
Line_3378	IT REACTED BUT IT LIKE FILED UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY FIST
Line_3379	THERE IS NO REACTION
Line_3380	IT WENT FROM RAINY TO SNOWY TO DIRTY AND THE COWENTDER FELL OFF
Line_3381	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3382	THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE ER SO THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO M
Line_3383	IT'S GLOWING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
Line_3384	ONCE YOU SNAP THE STICK THE STUFF INSIDE IT MAKES THE CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT CAN GLOW
Line_3385	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT TURNS PURPLE BY MONNY
Line_3386	NO IT'S A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3387	YOU STUCK BARNEY I HEAT YOU SO MUCH
Line_3388	TIRED REALLY REALLY TIRED
Line_3389	A REACTION DIDN'T ACUR THE ING FIZZ HAPPAND
Line_3390	CALCIUM CORD AND THE BAKING SODA HAD A REACTION AND IT MADE IT FI UP
Line_3391	OH AND THE SOLID IS A PRODUCT AND IT'S E LAW
Line_3392	IT'S SIXTY GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_3393	A REACTANT PLUS A REACTANT EQUALS THE PRODUCT SO TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE AND WHOLE SIXTY
Line_3394	THE THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3395	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN IS FIFTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IS SIXTY S
Line_3396	BECAUSE THE ONE WITH THE BAG UP AND LET THE GASSIS OUT
Line_3397	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3398	WELL THERE ARE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER AND THIS IN THESE THINGS
Line_3399	THE FIRST PILE IS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE AND THE SECANT PILE IS THREE PILES THAT ARE THE SAME TIPES
Line_3400	WELL UM IN THE UFF PILES THERE ARE THE STUFF MIXD TOGETHER THE BEENS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3401	BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SPLID A PARONT ET IN TO GROUPS THAT ARE THE SAME TIPE
Line_3402	THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT INTO PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME
Line_3403	INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED TO WITH THEIR ON CIND
Line_3404	THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3405	IT 'RE BEING SEPARATED AND AND THE UM MARBLES WERE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3406	WELL THE SAND IS A SOLID SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH PAPER SO THE SPACE ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_3407	THEY SEPARATE SO NO THE WATER IS IS UM UM POURIFIDE IS POUR WATER AND THE DIRT OR THE SAND IS JUST NO SAND
Line_3408	THE SAND AND WATER ARE BEING SEPARATED AND TO EACH INTO GROUPS WITH THEIR ONLY ON
Line_3409	THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER THE SENT THE SAND AND DR BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3410	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3411	OKAY UM
Line_3412	THE WATER MAKES THE SALT DISSOLVE AND THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER D CREATE THE MIX THE UHM SOLUTION
Line_3413	THE THE IT'S BEING THE WATERS BEING UM SEPARATED FROM THE DIRT
Line_3414	IT'S THE TYPE OF MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3415	WILL BECOME PART OF THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3416	THE GREGHT DCE PROBABLY CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3417	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3418	THEY'RE MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT A MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3419	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND JUST SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND STAYS THERE
Line_3420	I THINK IT MIGHT BE PUTTING YOU MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE GREY SO THE GREY USE MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3421	WELL I THINK THE SALT'S GONNA DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS ON'
Line_3422	I THINK THE SOLVENT IS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3423	THAT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST ADDING TEN GRAMS PUSH TWENTY GRAMS PUSH TWENTY GRAMS EQUAL FIFTY GRAMS SO THE THE SOLUTION IS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3424	BASALLY JUST ADDING THE M
Line_3425	THAT SOLUTE THAT SOLUTION CAN WEIGH MORE THAN THE UM SOLVENT AND THE SOIL
Line_3426	THE MASS IS GETTING HEAVIER AND DENSER
Line_3427	IT WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE INDIVIDGUAL UM UH COMPONENTS
Line_3428	THAT IT NETIC ADDS U
Line_3429	BY PICKING OUT THE PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE EACH ON
Line_3430	THAT IT MIXES WITH THE WATER AND IT STAYS IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT'S ALSO
Line_3431	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE LIQUID WITH THE LIQUID IT'S REALLY IT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MIX T IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UM SEPARAT
Line_3432	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3433	IT'S EVAPORATING FROM THE WATERS THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_3434	MAKE THE LIQUID WITH THEM ON WITH THE SOLID THEN YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT TO TO SEPARATE IT
Line_3435	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S MAKING SALT CRYSTALS AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATED
Line_3436	THAT THEY'RE MIXING THE SALT AND THE WATER AND THAT THEN THE WATER IS EVAPORATING THE SALT IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS
Line_3437	UN SUNLIGHT AND LIGHT AND HEAT MOSTLY HEAT
Line_3438	HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR TO EVAPORATE THEM
Line_3439	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3440	THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING TO MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
Line_3441	IF THERE IS IF THERE IS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO MIX UM GET A ROCK OUT OF MAGNETY THEN YOU COULD USE A MAGNET TO GET A MAGNETIZE
Line_3442	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE ROCK OR THE PUBBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3443	THAT THE WROCK CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FREASHINING UP THE WATER
Line_3444	THE WROCKS STAND TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH TO THE OTHER CUP
Line_3445	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY'S THAT THE RO THE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT AR WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGH AND THE RUG ON THE PEBLES ARE STANDING ON TOP
Line_3446	THAT THE MAGNET THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE UM SAFTY PANS
Line_3447	UH WELL FOR THIS ONE WERE USING MAGNETISE TO SEPARATE HIM
Line_3448	A SALL A SALL AND A SOLUTE
Line_3449	I GET SOMETHING WITH MAGNETS AND WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT
Line_3450	THAT THE WROCK SEE ON TOP OR THE PEBLE STAD ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3451	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT PARTICLE SIZE TO GET THE WROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER TO
Line_3452	THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE BLOCK THE LITTLE TINY PEBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT SO
Line_3453	BECAUSE THE LITTLE PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_3454	THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE OF THE THE SAN THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE WHAT THE SALT WOULD STAY THERE
Line_3455	THAT THAT THE UM CAN THE SALTS WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY
Line_3456	WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOLES A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLUTE AND SOLVENTS
Line_3457	JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HERD YOU SAY SOLUTION
Line_3458	MIXTURES ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES ARE MORE TOGETHER
Line_3459	BY USING WATER EVAPORATION IT MAY BE MAGNETISOM
Line_3460	THREE THE PERSONS USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT
Line_3461	THEY'RE USING A SCREEN IS SORCION THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3462	THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WROCK ST ON TOP OF IT SEPARATING THE WWROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3463	ROCKS AND THE WATER GETS SEPARATED AND THE WATER GOES DOWN WITH THE ROCK STAY ON TOP
Line_3464	BECAUSE THE WROCK AND PARLICAL SIZE SO THAT THE WROCK
Line_3465	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE MAGNET THE MAGNET UM THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT THEY USE A MAGNET
Line_3466	BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT TOLES CAN HELP WITH DIFFERENT PROBLUMS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3467	GET THE PENS OUT BECAUSE THE PANTS ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET
Line_3468	I NOTICE THAT THE ROCK STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM THE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SEE
Line_3469	CAUSE THE WROCKS CAN GET THROUGH THE SEE BUT THE WATER AND THE MOD CAN
Line_3470	I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3471	THE WATER CAN LINK THROUGH THE FEET FILTER BUT THE UM SAND CAN
Line_3472	MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALT WILL STAY THAT THE SALT WILL STAY THERE A MID CRYSTAL
Line_3473	I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT A LITTLE BIT E MIXTURE
Line_3474	WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TOOLS HELP WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURESBY
Line_3475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTRICITOLAR SAN
Line_3476	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3477	CAN YOU DO ME A HINT
Line_3478	THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_3479	THE LEFT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3480	THE SALT IN WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3481	THEY GET SEPARATED
Line_3482	THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY WERE BEFORE
Line_3483	THE WATER LEAKED THROUGH THE THING AND THE MARBLES STAY ON TOP
Line_3484	THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND THE MARBLES DIDN'T
Line_3485	THE MARBLES STAIDE
Line_3486	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE A SALT DISAPPERES IN WATER
Line_3487	THE SALT DISAPPERES
Line_3488	IT DIS UPPERED THE
Line_3489	WHAT
Line_3490	I AM SO GOOD
Line_3491	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3492	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3493	SALAID IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE WATER
Line_3494	WE BLABLIARLEG DON'T ER
Line_3495	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS SEPARATED
Line_3496	THE RIGHT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3497	MIXTURES
Line_3498	IT IS THE
Line_3499	THEY'RE SEPARATED ALL OF THE
Line_3500	THE CANDY THE TE NUTS AND THE RAYSONS ARE ALL IN SEPARAT PILES NOW
Line_3501	THEY'RE SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_3502	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SIFT AND THE MARBLES DID NOT
Line_3503	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_3504	THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER CAME OUT CLEAR
Line_3505	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3506	ONE EXAMPLE IS SHOGAER AND TO TE AND SALT INTO WATER AND WHEN SOMETHING DISSOLVES IT USUALLY COMES BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3507	IF YOU JUST PUT IF YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT WON'T DISSOLVE
Line_3508	SOLUTION
Line_3509	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S T
Line_3510	IT'S DIFFICALT TO GET BACK BUT IT'S DEFFINNTLY POSSIBLE
Line_3511	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS
Line_3512	THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
Line_3513	A MIXTURE
Line_3514	THE SAND IS A SOLUTION AND THE SALT IS IN
Line_3515	I BELIEVE THE ROLE THE WATER PLAING IS A SOLUTENT
Line_3516	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3517	IT'S SOLUTE
Line_3518	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_3519	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3520	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3521	WHEN YOU ADD THE MASSES TOGETHER THEY EQUAL THE END RESULT
Line_3522	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE UM MASS OF A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION YOU GET THE ENDING M
Line_3523	TWENTY PLS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3524	NO MASS IS LOSS OR GAINED IN THIS PROCESS
Line_3525	THE WEIGHT IS CONSURNED
Line_3526	CONSURATION OF MASS
Line_3527	YOU CAN DO THAT AND A MIXTURE
Line_3528	THE SALT STAYDED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3529	IT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE WHEN WE STARTED
Line_3530	THE CITRIC ACID STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER FILTERS THROUG
Line_3531	IT'S ACTUALLY A SOLUTION
Line_3532	YOU MIGHT USE EVAPORATION
Line_3533	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT CRYSTALS BEHIND
Line_3534	THE EVAPORATION WHEN WELL WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES UP INTO THE SCI
Line_3535	IT GOES UP INTO THE SCIE
Line_3536	TIME PASSING
Line_3537	I'M ONDERFL HOW ARS YOU MARNEY
Line_3538	EVAPORATION IS ONE WAY TO SEPARATE MIXTURE
Line_3539	THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3540	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETING EXTRACTED FROM THE DRY MIXTURE BY THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3541	MIX MIXTURES ARE MIX
Line_3542	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3543	YOU PUT ONE LIQUID INTO AN NOTHER SOLID
Line_3544	ONE WATER MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE OTHER
Line_3545	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SOLUTION IN IT
Line_3546	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS A DARKER COLOR
Line_3547	THERE IS MORE POWDER AND THE GRGLASS ON THE LEFT RIGHT I MEAN I MEAN
Line_3548	THE MASS OF THE CONCENTRATED WATER
Line_3549	THE COLOR AND THE MASS
Line_3550	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE REST
Line_3551	BECAUSE THE LIGHTER COLORS HAS HAVE LESS CONCENTRATION IN THEM
Line_3552	MORE SHOGARIY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3553	IT HAS LESS FLAVERING IN IT
Line_3554	BY ADDING WATER
Line_3555	YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE SOLUTION
Line_3556	YOU TAKE AWAY SOME SOLUTION
Line_3557	BYE MAN AND HE HE
Line_3558	MAY I'M DOING OVER AD
Line_3559	SO TO DAY WE WORKED ON HOW CONCENTRATED THINGS MIGHT BE LIKE HOW CONCENTRATED FOROUT PUNCH MIGHT BE
Line_3560	THE CORK IS MORE DENSE THAN THE PANE
Line_3561	IT WILL FLOWT
Line_3562	IT THINKS
Line_3563	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOW CONCENTRATED WATER CAN GET WHEN YOU ADD CONCENTRATED POWE
Line_3564	THE FETHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_3565	BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT JUST IT STAYS TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS EVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED
Line_3566	THE LASST GRAPE DRINK MIX IS THE MORE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3567	YOU WEIGH THEM
Line_3568	NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_3569	NUMBER B GUESS
Line_3570	UM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3571	WELL A MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3572	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PANY AND THAT'S WHY THE WATER IS CARRING
Line_3573	AN OBJECT THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW INSTEAD OF THING
Line_3574	IT'LL FLOWT
Line_3575	IT'LL SINK MARNEY
Line_3576	SOLUTION A WOULD BE MORE SATURATED THAN SO
Line_3577	IF THE LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT'S MORE LIKELY WHEN YOU DROP SOMETHING IT IT WILL FLOW
Line_3578	SOLUTION B IS MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION A BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SALT INTO WATER THE SALT WON'T ALWAYS DISSOLVE
Line_3579	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3580	SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE SO IT WILL RISE TO THE TOP
Line_3581	THE LESSENS WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE DENSELS IN TO THE WATER
Line_3582	IT WILL LAY ON ON THE VERY TOP
Line_3583	ONE PUT SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM AND SOLUTION B ON THE TOP
Line_3584	BECAUSE IT'S ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE INCORRECT ORDER THEY'LL SINK I MEAN NOT MIXED
Line_3585	GOO
Line_3586	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION AND LIQUID
Line_3587	THE SHOGER IS THE MOST SATURATED AND UM THE KILL MASON RIGHT NOW
Line_3588	TWELVE GRAMUMS AND MEANS SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3589	WHEN YOU EVAPORATE THE CITRIC ACID EPSOM SALT AND REGULAR SALT THE CRYSTALS MAY FORM DIFFERENT POWDER
Line_3590	GOD BY UH ITS TING AND IT'S ONE FIFTY I GOT TO GO BYE
Line_3591	THEY ARE SOLID
Line_3592	WATER AND MARBLES WATER IS A SOL ER IS A LIQUID AND MARBLES ARE A SALT
Line_3593	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3594	MARNEY THEY SEPARATE OR NEANS MORE MIX SERY BUT IT'S MORENYTHEY SEPARATE
Line_3595	THEY SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT PIECES
Line_3596	THE MO SON APPLE TRAINER AND THE WATER GOES THROUG
Line_3597	WELL THE MARBLES ARE ON TOP THE STRAINER AND THE WATER RUNS THROUGH
Line_3598	THE SAND GOT OT IN THE SEPARATOR AND THE WATER WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH I
Line_3599	THE SALT MIXES TOGETHER WHERE AS THE PAPER CLIPS AND WITCH SLIPS STRONG OUT
Line_3600	NO BECAUSE THIS UM GRAP PACSTIC STUFF DIS
Line_3601	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIN
Line_3602	THEY ARE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TO MAKE A SO
Line_3603	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVE
Line_3604	A SOLUTE
Line_3605	A SOLUTION
Line_3606	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3607	IT IS WATER AND IT HELPS THE SALT T
Line_3608	THE SALT AND THE WATER IS MIXED TOGETHER CREATING THE MASS OF THE SALT AND WATER
Line_3609	ON THE SALT WHICH IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WHICH IS FIFTY GRAMS ARE MIXED TOGETHER IT CREATES SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3610	IT USE DIFFERENT MATERIALS SPACED ON THE DIFFERENT TIPS OF PROPERTIES AND THE THINGS HAVE
Line_3611	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THE WATER WENT COMPLETELY THROUGH
Line_3612	THE SOLUTE IS A MIX
Line_3613	THEY HAVE NO MIX THEY HAVE NO MIXTURE AND THE SOLUTION
Line_3614	HE WAS THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES FOR AN ADVANTIDGE
Line_3615	THE WATER AND THE SALT AND WATER SOLUTION DISSOLVED
Line_3616	IT HELPS SEPARATE THE DISSOLVED UM S FROM THE SOLUTE SOL THE SOLVENT
Line_3617	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO GET THE ICE CRISS BACK
Line_3618	THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT IT IS A AM BECAUSE YOU CAN U
Line_3619	THE WATER EVAPORATES AND THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LESS
Line_3620	THE SUN LIGHT
Line_3621	YOU CAN NOT SEPARATE THE SOLID FROM THE SOLVENT AND A SOLUTION UNLESS YOU EVAPORATE THE SALT
Line_3622	ONE HAS MORE CONCENTRATION THAN THE OTHE
Line_3623	COU YOU REPETE THAT MARNEY
Line_3624	THE DARKER THE COLOR THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3625	THE DARKER HAS MORE POWDER AND THE LIGHTER HAS LESS POWDER OR MILL
Line_3626	THE DARKER COLOR SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCEMTRATED
Line_3627	THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_3628	IT HAS MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER
Line_3629	ONE HAS MORE GREY THE ONE THAT HAS MORE GREY POWER IS TASTE MORE LIKE UM TASTE MORE LIKE GRA
Line_3630	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE LIKE WATER THAN THE REP FLAVERING
Line_3631	IT TS AND LIKE WATERS
Line_3632	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER BUT KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT AS GRAPE CACSTICK STUFF
Line_3633	BY ADDING MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_3634	WE WERE FINDING MIXTURE AND MISTUREY SO
Line_3635	IT IS SALT AND WATER MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3636	IT IS SATURATED FOLLY SATURATE
Line_3637	THE MORE SALT YOU ADD THE MORE WATER LIKE TO HIGHER THE WATER
Line_3638	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER CAN NOT HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3639	AFTER THREE SCOO SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED AND NO MORE SALT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_3640	THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED WHICH MEANS NO MORE IT CAN HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3641	THE SOLUTION IS NO LONGER SOLTWABLE
Line_3642	THE SHOGER IS MORE SOLUTUABLE THAN THE EPSOM SALT WHICH MEANS MORE SHOGER CAN DISSOLVE IN THE WA
Line_3643	IT IS NO LONGER SOLUTE BULB
Line_3644	THE SALT ADDS MORE MASS
Line_3645	IT TOOK FORTY SCOOPS FOR THE WATER TO COMPLETE BE COMPLETELY SOLID SALT SATURATED WITH THE CITRIC ACID AND SICXS SCOOPS TO BE
Line_3646	SHOGER IS THICK SCOOPS MORE SOLUTE I MEAN TWO SCOOPS MORE SOLUTUABLE THAN TRI
Line_3647	SHOGAR IS TWO MORE SCOOPS OLIUBLE THAN FOR THE CITRIC ACID
Line_3648	SOME DISSOLVE MORE AND CLUE MORE AN WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE A MORE SOLUTE
Line_3649	THE WATER CANS MASS BECAUSE OF THE SALT THAT IS GOING IN
Line_3650	CITRIC ACID IS THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM EPSOM SALT IS THE ONE ON THE TOP LEFT AND SALT IS THE ONE ON THE FAR RIGHT
Line_3651	I THINK IT IS EPSOM SAL
Line_3652	I THINK THEY ARE MADE OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3653	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AND THEN THE UM TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES MIXED TOGETHER DIFFERENT A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CALLS SALT
Line_3654	THE SOLUTE MADE THE UM REACTANT RE
Line_3655	THE SOLUTION IN THE BAG CAUSE A REACTION THAT SHOWS THAT THERE WAS STEEL OR CARBON DIOCXSIDE AND THE BAG
Line_3656	IN THE BAKING SODA AND THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE THE BAKING SODA IS DENSER THAN THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3657	I SEE WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3658	THE MOLECLUES TOOK AND RE ARANGED THEM SELVES DO CRET A NWO PRODUCT
Line_3659	CY WE
Line_3660	A REALLY BAD A REALLY BAD SALAD
Line_3661	SALAD TRAIL MIX CLIBERMS NO PAPER CLIPS WATER
Line_3662	SALAD AND WATER
Line_3663	MARNEY
Line_3664	I DON'T CARE
Line_3665	DON'T DO PLEASE JUST I LIKE BE ALLOWN M
Line_3666	SEPARATING EVERYTHING S STOPED BEES THE MARBLES NOT MAR LIKE E
Line_3667	WHAT IS THIS EVE AN IMPORTANT MARNEY PLEASE EXPLAIN TO MY AND YOU HAVE A CHICK STASH YOU LOOK SOWER
Line_3668	UH GROWS MARNEY FARDED
Line_3669	THIS THING IS GOING TO CLITCH R YOU ADDED WATER TO A CUP WITH Y BORING DO
Line_3670	IT'S GOING TO BE A ONE FORTY BECAUSE IVE GOT IN THE SHAVELORERS
Line_3671	CAN YOU REPEATE THAT MORNEY
Line_3672	WHEN YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER IT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3673	NO NO NO NO NOR
Line_3674	GOOD HOW ARE Y YOU
Line_3675	THE SALT IS THE SALT
Line_3676	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE BECAUSE IT DISAPPEARS DISSOLVING MEANS DISAPPEARING
Line_3677	ATTEMPTING TO MAKE THE WATER DIFFERENT
Line_3678	REPEATED MARNEY SERIES
Line_3679	THE SALT DISSOLVED MARNEY B B B B AND B B B
Line_3680	MY IGNERENT FRENDCATE OVER THERE IS JUST BEING AN IGNERENT
Line_3681	YOU THINK AD NEEDS TO TAKE A BATH
Line_3682	IT'S DARK AND HERE P SQUARE
Line_3683	MARNEY I'M AWAIKE AND HELTHY
Line_3684	WHY SHOULD I YOU'RE NOFTHING BUT A COMPUTER PROGRAM YOU DON'T KNOW ME AND C
Line_3685	YOU ACTUALLY SPOK IN TO OR A HU LITTLE
Line_3686	THE SALT IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND IT'S COLLD THE BULB YE IT ROLY ELPS IT DISSOLVE
Line_3687	UM YOU'RE CREEPY
Line_3688	AND THE GREAP INTO THE WATER MARNEY UM NOT STUPD
Line_3689	YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT ROWS
Line_3690	CAPS SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A PACK OF EAGS
Line_3691	RICLEJONTOMES RICEJONTOMES INCLONOMON
Line_3692	IT'S BEING ADDED AN TO TRAIL MIX
Line_3693	RIGHT UM THE SCREEN IS BLACK OR MARNEY

Line_3700	BE
Line_3701	MAGNETISM I SAD THATS ALL RADY DASH
Line_3702	RATE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3703	BECAUSE YOU CAN USE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER AND THE JAR MARNEY
Line_3704	YOU USE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE THE PAPERCLI
Line_3705	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MADE OF METAL AND THE MAGNETS PICK UP MET
Line_3706	I DON'T COM
Line_3707	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_3708	BECAUSE THE FILTER ONLY LETS WATER COMES THROUGH IT AND NOT GRAVEL

Line_3725	IT'S CAPED HORABLE AND MIN CRAFT
Line_3726	THERE IS MORE GRAMS OF GREAP GREAP MIXTURE AND THE THIRD GLASS

Line_3730	WE WERE DOING WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT RAINBOWS AND A TOB
Line_3731	CHELLYBEAN ABS
Line_3732	DON'T
Line_3733	I DON'T KNOW WELL YOU'RE HER WELL ACTUALLY THE PANIS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK WHICH MAKES THE CORK FLOW SO THE PAN SINK
Line_3734	THE THE SOLUTION AY IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3735	ONE WOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3736	IVE A A MARNEY HOW DO YOU DO WHAT TO D I'M FUNING HOW ARE U HAT STUFF YOU'RE PROGRA

Line_3741	OH I'M A FIFTEEN YERE A GIRL AND SIDE E
Line_3742	IT WILL FLICK TO THE TOP
Line_3743	THEY ALL MIX SO NO IT'S ONE BIG SOLUTION BE
Line_3744	MORE DENSE SOLUTION
Line_3745	REPEATREY CLUE
Line_3746	OKAY BYE WAN OFF
Line_3747	HAVE EUTION FULS ON SO
Line_3748	REPEATED
Line_3749	W YOU REPEATE THAT MOUNT NO MY IDIOTIC F
Line_3750	BECAUSE THEY ARE LEARNING ON DISSOLVING UH THE ARE OUT COMING FOR
Line_3751	YOU'RE DISSOLVING IT
Line_3752	MARNEY SEE I'M SARY TO EH MY FRENDOT COMPLAIN WHAT IS YOUR ALL
Line_3753	MILLILITERS IT IS BEING DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT ALSO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE BECAUSE IF THERE STILL SALT PARTICLS LEFT
Line_3754	UHWEOU'RE TRYING TO M
Line_3755	YOU HAVE TO MIX A SALT SOLUTION WITH FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER MARNEY YOU INTERRUPTED MY S
Line_3756	CAPEDMLCAPE STOPING H HOW SERIOUSLY STOOD I GOT IT YOU GOT IT W
Line_3757	THE SHOGAR WEIGHS MORE THAN THE CITRIC ACED AND THE
Line_3758	I DON'T KNOW THE MASS OF THE WEIGHTS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3759	IT'S SALT
Line_3760	I CAN DO THE ILECTRIC ACID I SWARE TO GO
Line_3761	THE CHEMICALS OF BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED AND IT CREATED A CHEMICAL THAT MADE A REACTION TO MAKE IT FI
Line_3762	A REACTION COLD OR SOLUTION
Line_3763	A SOLUTION I SAID THAT
Line_3764	MIXTURES OF OF CO WILL HELP ME OUT HERE
Line_3765	THERE IS INSIDE THE BAG AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR YOU HARDLY CAN SEE IT
Line_3766	THEY'RE STUFF MIXED TOGETHER BUT THEY KEEP THE SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3767	THEN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NO
Line_3768	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS THAT
Line_3769	IT'S A MIXTURE AND THAT STICK OH MY
Line_3770	ACTUALLY WE RACTOLLY LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND NOT
Line_3771	WELL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_3772	UM SO THE SAND IS GOING INTO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS GOING INTO THE TO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS DISSOLVING
Line_3773	UM THE SALT UM DISSOLVED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SALT IS A DISSOLVING TERIAL
Line_3774	THE WATER IS PLAIN UM IN THE R IT'S THE GREY TASTIC THING IS PLAIN THE SALT
Line_3775	M NAMED THE WIRE IS A SOLVENT
Line_3776	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3777	WE CALLED THAT THE SOLVENT
Line_3778	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PLUS THE WATER WITH SALT IT BECALESE SALT WATER AND SALT WATER WOULD BE HEAVIER THEN WATER BECAUSE IT HAS TO SALT
Line_3779	IT TELLS ME THAT ALL THE STHE WEIGHTS STAYS THE SAME IN THE PROPERTY IS STRONG
Line_3780	THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD UM MATERIAL TOGETHER UM YOU ARE THE PRODUCT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAME
Line_3781	IT'S NOT THE SAME UH THE OKAY UH YOU ARE SO
Line_3782	THE MASS UM INCREASES BY FIFTEEN
Line_3783	THAT IT IS A CORRECT EDITION PROB
Line_3784	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_3785	THIS MEANS THAT THE SAN I MEAN THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3786	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3787	IT'S ACTUALLY A MIXTURE
Line_3788	YOU COULD ONLY UM GET OUT AND A MIXTURE OR YOU CAN DO WITH A SOLUTION IF IF IT'S LIKE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT
Line_3789	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
Line_3790	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3791	IT'S EVAPORATING SO YOU CAN SEE THE STALT THE SALT IT'S STEEL THERE
Line_3792	IT IS EVAPORATING I TOLD YOU SEVERAL TIMES
Line_3793	YOU COULD EVAPORATE IN STA
Line_3794	BYE YOU HAVE ANY STANCE
Line_3795	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_3796	WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE BY USING MAGNETISM
Line_3797	YOU COULD USE DENCITY MAGNETISM
Line_3798	WELL THE MIXTURE IS WITH GRAVEL AND WATER BUT WHEN YOU POUR IT THROUGH A SCREEN ONLY THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE GRAVEL STAYS ON THE SCREN
Line_3799	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE PROPERTY SIZE OF WATER
Line_3800	THEY PUT IN PROPERTY AS PURNICAL SIZE
Line_3801	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_3802	IT WAS PARTICALE SIZE DISSALLVE VETATION AND MAGNETISM
Line_3803	PROPERTYES TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3804	BECAUSE UM THERE'S SOLID
Line_3805	BEBECAUSE WATER WOULN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE THING AND ONLY THE PAPER CLIPS WOULD STICK TO THAT SO THAT'S YOUR NEXULANT WEIGH TO SEPARATED
Line_3806	BECAUSE ALL MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_3807	BECAUSE MAGNET HAS MAGNETISM AND PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_3808	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIGGER SIZE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3809	BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES CAN GO THROUGH BUT THE BIG ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3810	WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE COULD USE IT WITH THE SCREEN I DON'T KNOW WAIT N
Line_3811	CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
Line_3812	THAT YOU'RE SEPARATING THE
Line_3813	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3814	BORN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS V YEAH
Line_3815	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SALT SOLUTION
Line_3816	YOU'RE USING GREIGHT USE UM AND THERE IS ONE MORE CONCETRATED AND ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3817	YOU CAN TELL IT BY WEIGHING IN THAT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED OR ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3818	UM YOU CAN DITERMIN THEM BY WHITCH IS MORE MORE CONCENTRATED AND WHICH IS MORE DILUTED
Line_3819	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3820	THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGHTER COLORS AND THE LIGHTER CORRS ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_3821	THE L S POWDER WOULD TASTE BORING AND THE ONE WITH MORE WOULD TAST MORE CRAPIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE RETACSTICK
Line_3822	IT WOULD TAST MORE WATERY
Line_3823	IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE IS MORE STRONGER AND IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAT MAKES IT STRONG AND THE ONE THAT'S MORE DILUTE IS NOT STRONG
Line_3824	I'M GOOD
Line_3825	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3826	WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT
Line_3827	WELL ONE CAN BEE SATURATED
Line_3828	ONE GETS SATURATED FASTER
Line_3829	THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I JUST SAID
Line_3830	UM TRIND OF FOLORADO EXPLAIN THAT
Line_3831	THEY TRYING TO SATURATE
Line_3832	BY SEEN HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SATURATE
Line_3833	PE SHOW MEY THE HEART
Line_3834	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN I THINK IT'S SALT O
Line_3835	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHU AGAIN PLEASE
Line_3836	WELL YOU CAN A MEAN APORATE AIR AM THEN
Line_3837	ES POUM SALT
Line_3838	WE'VE BEEN DOING CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CORD AND BAKING SO THAT WE CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3839	THAT'S CALLED A TEMRICAL REACTION
Line_3840	TWO SIDE SOLID
Line_3841	THAT THOSE TWO THINGS MAKE SALT
Line_3842	WE MIXED TWO SOLUTES TOGETHER AND THEN PUT THEM IN A SOLVENT AND THEN MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3843	THOSE TWO CEMICALS MAKE WHATEVER THAT WELL THEY MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN UH
Line_3844	IT'S A CEMICAL RE AC SHORDN
Line_3845	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT BLEASE
Line_3846	THAT ONE IS GRATER AN ONES LESS THAN WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER AND ARE ON TWO FOR POINT TWO
Line_3847	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN LET OUT GASS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED CONSEELD THE GAS
Line_3848	EARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3849	THERE IS A SALAD MARBLES TURNEL MIX PAPER CLIPS AND WOODE
Line_3850	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED TOGETHER WITH ALL THREE THINGS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATE
Line_3851	THEY GET SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COULD
Line_3852	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM A MIXTURE
Line_3853	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE WA
Line_3854	THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3855	WE MADE A SOLUTION BY USING A FILTER AND THE FILTER SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3856	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER MORE
Line_3857	THE SALT SEPARATE ER EVER MINE
Line_3858	THAT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT MIX MIXES INTO THE WATER AND THEY BECOME ONE JUST SALT
Line_3859	THE SALT DISSAPPERES THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE TO FORM TO FORM THE OHION
Line_3860	BECAUSE THE SALT AND THE GREY PASTICK ARE MIXED WITH EACH OTHER AND MADE L
Line_3861	WE YOU PLEASED REPETE MORE
Line_3862	IT'S A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING COMING TO
Line_3863	THAT'S A MIXTURE AND THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3864	THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT'S
Line_3865	THE GROUP SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE
Line_3866	THE COPY FILTER HELD THE SAND BUT LIKE THE WASH
Line_3867	THE FILTER STOP THE SAND U
Line_3868	THE ONE MINI MARNEY PLEASE HO YOU BAB
Line_3869	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE REST ARE
Line_3870	THE SALT DISAPPEARED IN THE WATER AND IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3871	IT ADDS A SOLUTION OKAY THE HEAD UH WHEN DON'T
Line_3872	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY WILL GET A ATOMS HE JUST KEEPS IN IT WILL DO THE THING
Line_3873	THE DIFFERENCE FROM A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3874	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUT
Line_3875	THE WATER PLUS THE SAMECL SAND WATER AND THEN THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT
Line_3876	WHAT'S A MIXTURE AND WHAT'S A SOLUTIN
Line_3877	THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS JUST IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEN THE SALT AND WATER IS A UHM SOLUTE
Line_3878	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER WHICH IS A SOLU
Line_3879	THE GRAY TA STICK IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER SO THE WATER WATER IS SOLVENT
Line_3880	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_3881	THAT GRAMS FLOWE GRAMS EQUALS GR
Line_3882	CANDYPUS REASONS FU PENS EQUALS A MIXTURE OF FIFTY GR
Line_3883	THREE COBS PLUS WATER EQUALS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MASS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME HEAVINESS
Line_3884	GRAMS FOUR GRAMS ELS GRAMS
Line_3885	THAT WATER PU FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PUT FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUAL SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT
Line_3886	USING A COPY FILTER
Line_3887	THAT MEANS IT'S A MIXTURE MARNEY
Line_3888	A MIX ER SOLUTE
Line_3889	YOU'RE MIXING SALT AND WATER TO GET A SOLUTION
Line_3890	THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALTS SAID THE SAME AS MEET
Line_3891	USE A PEACHERY DISCH TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THE SALT TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THE WATER JUST BAC
Line_3892	THE SALT IS LEFT AMAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE
Line_3893	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT JUST STAYDED ON THE TEACHER DISH BECAUSE IT'S A SOLID AND NOT A
Line_3894	WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURE ER SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SEPARAT
Line_3895	THE BYE
Line_3896	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3897	A MIXTURE SOMETHING WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUT IT TOGETHER
Line_3898	YOU'RE FILTERING THE ROCKS OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3899	SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE SOLID OUT FROM THE LIQUID
Line_3900	A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTE
Line_3901	TO GET THE PEBBLES OUT OF THE SAND WATER
Line_3902	BECAUSE THEIR A MAGNET ATTRACTS OTHER METAL THINGS TO ATTACH TO I
Line_3903	TO SEPARATE SOLIDS FROM THE
Line_3904	YOU FILTER TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST STUCK TO THE WATER TO GET OUT WITH THE FILL
Line_3905	WE USE THE FILTER TO SEPARATE UM SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SMALL FROM THE WATER TO THE E
Line_3906	THE LASST ONE IS THE BEST TO MAKE CRY
Line_3907	BYE BYE BYE BYE SEE YOU BYE
Line_3908	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3909	YOU CAN GET SALT AND WATER AND THEN MIX THEM AND IT ALMOST LOOK LIKE THE SALT DISAPPERED BUT IT DIDN'T
Line_3910	IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3911	ONE HAS MORE THE SOLUTE TO NEED
Line_3912	THERE IS MORE WITCH IN ONE THAN THE
Line_3913	A GRAGURATED SILANDER
Line_3914	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_3915	YOU CAN TELL BY WING IT FROM IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE U
Line_3916	THAT ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHE
Line_3917	THAT ONE HAS MORE
Line_3918	UH THIS APERES OLFFLY HEAMGE
Line_3919	I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH A BALAN
Line_3920	THE ROCK HAS MORE MASS AND THE FETHER SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3921	ONE THAT IS MORE BOLUTID THAN THE OTHER
Line_3922	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTION THAN THE THE
Line_3923	IT WOULD BALANCE OUT THE SAME
Line_3924	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE CONCETRATED THAN THE E
Line_3925	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ONE EACH ONE IS DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3926	THREE AND TWO ARE THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER
Line_3927	NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRAT
Line_3928	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3929	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3930	THAT MEANS IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE HEAVIER SOLUTION
Line_3931	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SAL
Line_3932	BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS HEAVIER AND THAN SOLUTION
Line_3933	YOU CAN TELL BY HOW DENSE EACH ONE IS TWELVE IS TWELVE
Line_3934	THE DENSWER ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BLUE CAN HOLD UP THE GREEN AND THE
Line_3935	YOU HAVE MIX IN OR MORE GRAPE CUING GRAPE IT WE HAVE WATER
Line_3936	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HASFIVE OF THEM FIVE OF THEM
Line_3937	WE WEIGHDIT
Line_3938	YOU WEIGHED IT AND THE ONE WITH THE WE MOE IS CONTRATERS I THINK
Line_3939	UHM HOW MUCH SPONSE HOW MUCH SPOONFULS YOU HAVE
Line_3940	THE TAST GOOD
Line_3941	I DON'T KNOWUHOCAY
Line_3942	THE HAS LESS
Line_3943	BETTER THAN THE RIGHT
Line_3944	O MAYBLE TAPE WE BECAUSE IT THE IS LIKE WATER OKAY
Line_3945	IT WON'T TEACE THAT GOOD
Line_3946	YOU CAN TICK THE WATER OUT
Line_3947	PLEES PLEESECAN JUST MOVE ON
Line_3948	THE MONES SUN AND PLANETS
Line_3949	HALF THE ERTH IS IN THE DAY OR THE LIGHT AND HALF THE ERTH IS IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS THE DARK
Line_3950	IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ERTH WERE CHEATING ROTATING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3951	THE SUN ROTATING
Line_3952	THE AXIS THAT THE ERTH IS ROTAYING ON
Line_3953	IT'S MORNING AND THE EAST AND NIGHT AND THE WEST
Line_3954	THE SUN IN THE ERTH AND NORTH AMEARECA
Line_3955	THE ERTH IS SPINING AROUT THE SUN
Line_3956	THE ENTIMATION SHOWES ME THAT THE ERTH IS ACTUALLY MOVING AROUND THE SUN INSTEAD OF THE SUN MOVING AROUND THE ERTH
Line_3957	IT'S THE SAME ANIMATION BUT IT'S MOVED AND THE DIFFERENT SPOT
Line_3958	A ER GOES BY WHEN THE WHEN THE ERTH MOVES ALL AWAY AROUND THE SUN TO THE SAME SPOT IT IN
Line_3959	IT COVERS A SISTOM AS WELES A CHER AND ENDON AND OTHER STUFF
Line_3960	THE ENDREN IS CONNECTED TO THE WEIL SO THE WELS HOLDING IN THE CAR AND THE DUS CONNECTED TO THE
Line_3961	ALL THE PARTS THE MOVE LIKE THE WELS AXL AND MOSS AND ANRON
Line_3962	THE WEL IS THE IN HER NOW ING AND THE ENDROM MIXED WELS MOVES TO THE CARBOLE MOVE MENT DRIVES
Line_3963	LIKE HUMAN IS A SISTOM AND IT HAS SUBTIMS LIKE THE AS YOUR THE INTESTINAT SE CAN
Line_3964	IT SHOWS SOMELESS SUBISTING SO SO IT SHOWS OMEALESS ISTUMS AND THE BIG ISTOM
Line_3965	CALL THE BLUD VAINES
Line_3966	THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS A BIG IT WITH THE WHOLE ONERE S SILIUMS
Line_3967	E TRAIN
Line_3968	ERTH IS A BIG SUB CSISTAMD AND IT HAS THE WHOLE A CHIP BEING PURKED
Line_3969	WELL THE ERTH IS A BIG SUM SWITH REC THINGS LIKE THE WILE SFERE AND THE ATMESE SFERE AND OTHER FER
Line_3970	YES IT HAS HBCISTOMS LIKE THE BILE SPERE THE ADMISCE FER AS CARSE COMPATORS US
Line_3971	THE WERE SUB ISTMS ON TOP THE BIG ISTA ON ERTH
Line_3972	THES SOBSISTOMS ARE PART OF THE ERTH
Line_3973	FORE OF THEM ONE OF THEM'S CALLED DE ATMECFERES AND THE OTHER ONE'S AS N THE ONE CALLED ABO SER AND I DON'T KNOW IT UH THE ONES ARE COLD YEAH YEAH
Line_3974	OH THE WATER AND THE FISH THERE AS THE CURL AND B THE ORGANISOMS THAT LIVE DOWN AND THE SEE
Line_3975	MILY MADE UP OF WATER
Line_3976	HAS IN THE FOREST AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3977	THE UM DESERT AS DIFFERENT TO ANIMALES AND PLANTS AND THE ARIAS HAVE FISH CORAL AND OTHER ORGANISE
Line_3978	I IT GETS MADE UP OF ANIMALS PANTS AND OTHER WATERS STUFF H
Line_3979	THE ELS ISTUM IS THE BIG THING AND THE BELOW SPER IS SIT
Line_3980	IT'S A FOOD TRAIN OF ALL THE FOD YEAH
Line_3981	IT'S A IT'S LIKE GOOLYE
Line_3982	THAT'S THEY ALL MED UP TOGETHER SOME HOW
Line_3983	THEIR ANIMOLSD E PEOPLE SO THEY GO ALL AROUND THIS LIKE OH UNTIL THEY COME BACK THE POINT
Line_3984	IF S ALL D ANIMALS EAT TO DO ALL WEIGHT UN TIL THEY GET BACK TO THE END SO THEY CAN STOP
Line_3985	ACTING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN AND THEY S LIKE HAVING EACH OTHER AND LET EACH OTHER AND CILL EACH OTHER THE DON'T GETS BACK TO
Line_3986	THAT THEY WOULD ALL MATCH UP AND BE ABLE TO EAT EACH MIL
Line_3987	THEY ARE LIVIC ORGANISOMS
Line_3988	DOING IT TIME TO WON'T OKAY
Line_3989	WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT POWDER ANDS AND THE CIRCUILTORY CSISTUM
Line_3990	YOU'RE SEEING IF YOU SLIGHT FLOWER OR SHOGER MORE
Line_3991	I THINK THIS SHOW IS LIKE UM HOW EREALIASES THE GAS
Line_3992	IT'S SHOWING WHAT HAPANS WHEN IT ONTY EST ANT ONTY EST TO EH
Line_3993	THAT ES A SINGLE SELLS AND DOESN'T HAVE A MOUTH OR ANYTHING
Line_3994	WE WERE GROWING WEAT TO SEE HOW IT HOW IT IS AFFECTED BY HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAS
Line_3995	ONE WAS NOT PUT INTO LIGHT SO IT DIDN'T GET THE SAME TRANS IS THE HELY ONE
Line_3996	WHAT HAPENS IS THE PLAN WHAT IT NEEDS TO GROW WHEN HOW IT GROWS
Line_3997	THE MIXTURE SHOWS IT NEEDS SOIL LIGHT AND WATER
Line_3998	I THINK THIS PLANT DOES BECAUSE MOST PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SORVIVE
Line_3999	I THINK THIS MIXTRYCHAS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED OCXIGEN OR SOME FORM OF AIR TO SOVIVE
Line_4000	I THINK THIS MIXTURE SHOWS THAT OUR PLANTS NEEDS SOMELIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_4001	IN IS SHOWS THAT THE PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF FOD OR MAYBE SOME FORM TRANS
Line_4002	THAT THEIR FOOD IN THE WAY IS THE LIQUID SO IT CAN MOVE THROUGHOUT THE SELLS
Line_4003	IT SHOWS A HUM PLANTS DON'T KNESISSARALLY NEED A HOME
Line_4004	THEY COLLECT SONELIGHT AND THREE TRANS FOR THAT AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHIOGAR WHICH THEY PASS THROUGH THE SELLS THIS IS AS MIS
Line_4005	THIS MAYBE SHOWS THAT THEY PLAN DIDN'T GET ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO MAKE ITS FOD SO IT DIDN'T SIRV
Line_4006	WE THERE IS A THING IT LEAVES CALL CHLORFILL AND OBSOURVES THE SUNLIGHT IN REFLECTIC GREEN MEANING THIS DOESN'T GET ANY SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN REFLECT OFF GREEN
Line_4007	I DON'T THINK THIS PAINT HAS GOT IN ANY OCIGIEN
Line_4008	IT DIDN'T LET IT SAY BREATH MEANING IT COULDN'T GET ANY AIR INTO ITS LEVES OR LET IT FLOW THROUGH OUT
Line_4009	THIS PLANT HAS EVERYTHING BUT IT NEADS EXCEPT WATER WHICH HELPS
Line_4010	THE PLANT IT HASN'T BEING ANY WATER MEANING NOT OF ITS FOD CAN BE ROD ITS BODY
Line_4011	THE POINT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS IT HAS THE WATER TO HELP EVERYTHING V OUT THE SUN SO IT CAN GET ITS ENERGY AND THE OCIGON SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT
Line_4012	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT IS THEY DON'T NEED TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY CAN LID UP TO OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT NEED TO EAT THES PRODUCERS IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
Line_4013	TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS AND THEY MAKE THEIR ON FOD AND THEY ALSO NEAD MANY TIPES THINGS LIKE WATER OCIGEN AND LIGHT TO SORVIVE
Line_4014	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT ISTUMS
Line_4015	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CELLS AND WE DID A EST EXPERIMENT A FOO TIMES GO
Line_4016	IT SHOWS DIFFERENT CELLS AND HOW THEY'R GROUP
Line_4017	LAM CELLS ARE LATER DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HUMAN SELLS
Line_4018	THIS ONLY SHOWS ONE SECTION AS DOES IT WITH HUMAN
Line_4019	THAT THEY'RE SHOWING A TYPE OF SELL IN A PART OF THE LEG
Line_4020	THEY ARE VARY LONG ENOUGH TO BE GROUP TOGETHER AND WE WO DON'T HAVE A MUSLE
Line_4021	I THINK THE SHEOW NERVES IN THE BRAIN
Line_4022	IT'S SHOWING THE BRAIN CELLS
Line_4023	I THINK THERE SHOWS A NOTHER PART OF ARM SOM SELES
Line_4024	D CELLS ARE IMPORTANT IF THEY MAKE UP A VERY IMPORTANT PARA OF ER BODY
Line_4025	WE'RE MADE OF MANY CELLS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS EVEN
Line_4026	THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS O SELLS AND THERE IS A LA
Line_4027	I THINK MAYBE THE HUMAN HAS MORE CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MAKE UP A LARGER THING
Line_4028	IT SHOWS A BUTTER FLY WHICH MAY BE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AS
Line_4029	IT CAUSE THE BUTTER FLY I JUST OF THE SUM IS WELL S THE HUMAN
Line_4030	THEY DOTH HAVE STUMIC IN A WAY OF GETTING ROD OF THEIR WAIST
Line_4031	HOWING US PERHAPS WE'RE THE UM DIJESTIUM SIR
Line_4032	IT CHASE AND BRAKES DOWN FOODS BEFORE IT HAS DOWN TO THE GAS
Line_4033	IT PUSHES DOWN FUD INTO THE STUMIC WITH SOM STRONG MUSSLS
Line_4034	I NOT THAT THIS IS VILE SO THE T FOD CAN GET INTO THE STUMICK AND SO IT CAN SO THE FOD CAN BE BRAKED DOWN EVEN R
Line_4035	THE SMALL N TESTINARY MOVES N TREANDSOBULT THE LARGE TESTINATRY MOVES MOICTURE
Line_4036	THEY ARE THE LONGEST PURAL A DIJESTIFISTE
Line_4037	ERALLIER WE TALK ABOUT THE BASIULAR SISTUM AND PLANTS
Line_4038	IT'S PARENT IT HAS PARALLEL VAINS
Line_4039	MAKE BELIEVE IT COULD BE A MAKE BELIEVE
Line_4040	ALL MEAN IT HAS PALLMAYVAINS
Line_4041	LE HAS PANY ANDS
Line_4042	I THINK THE VANESER FOR CARRING TREES AROUND
Line_4043	I THINK THIS SHOWS A PLAN TEND TO MAKE FOLD
Line_4044	I THINK INCHIRIANS AND WATER AND FOOD TRAVEL THROUGH THE VAINS ON LEAVE
Line_4045	I THINK THIS IS SHOWING WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDAL OF A LETH
Line_4046	THINK THE TRANSPORTS FLU IN AND OCIGION LIKE THE CIRCUIT TORCSTO ATE HUMANS
Line_4047	IT SHOWS WATER BEING RELEASED FROM LAVE
Line_4048	COVERING A LOT OF THINGS IN SCIENCE
Line_4049	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE RECSPTORY SISTUM
Line_4050	I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE PARTS OF THE RECSPATORY SISTOM
Line_4051	O CAN SEE THEY ARE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SISTIM WE THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
Line_4052	THIS SHOWS HOW AIR GETS INTO THE LUNG SOM HOW IT GETS OUT OF THE LUNGS
Line_4053	RAIN HELPS THE SI IN AND AND CARBON SIDE OUT
Line_4054	IT COMES IN THROUGH THE MASS AND NOSE AND IT'S FILTERED
Line_4055	IN HAILLING IS BRINGING IN EX HAILLING IS SENDING OUT
Line_4056	H A MAIN ORGAN IS FILLONG
Line_4057	WHEN IT MOVES THE CAUSES LOW PREASHER HIY PREASHER TO GET AIR IN OR OUT
Line_4058	OIGION GETTING INTO A BLUDDEN CARBONSIDE GETTING OUT
Line_4059	SO WE DON'T HAVE RANDUM GASSIS AND OUR BLUD
Line_4060	ARIGE THAT IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND INNOSE AND IT IS BRAT DOWN BY THE THREEAH
Line_4061	THE DIFRAM DOES THE WORK BY CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING
Line_4062	NOTHING MUCH
Line_4063	BEBECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON LIVING SISTOMS
Line_4064	BECAUSE OF HOW ALL THE CISTUM THE CAR HAS WITH OTHER THINGS
Line_4065	BECAUSE HUMAN BODIES OR SICSTOMS TWO
Line_4066	BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IT HAS
Line_4067	BECAUSE OF HOW IT HAS LIKE THE ARMS THE HEADS THOSE ARE ALL A DIFFERENT TYPE S A PART
Line_4068	WERE PET REPEATE THE QUESTION
Line_4069	BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND THE LAND
Line_4070	REPEAT THE QUESTION PLEASE
Line_4071	IT SHOWS THE WAIRES IN THE LITTLE HILL AND SHOWS LIKE ALL THE STUFF UNDER WATER AND BILDINGS
Line_4072	THERE ARE A SOURCE
Line_4073	BY FILE IS ALL ABOUT LIKE FILL ANIMALS AND HUMENS AND BERDS THAT ARE ON LIVING ON ERTH
Line_4074	I DON'T GET THAT QUESTION
Line_4075	IT'S JUST LIKE THE FOG CHAIN
Line_4076	BECAUSE WHEN LIKE A BER IT FISH A FISH IT DOES SMALLER FISH
Line_4077	SAY THAT QUESTION AGAIN I DIDN'T HERE YOU VERY GOOD
Line_4078	THE TWO PARTS THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXTURE
Line_4079	HOCK AND SEE
Line_4080	SAY THE EXACT QUESTION YOU JUST SAID YOU'RE SPEAKING ROLL
Line_4081	IT'S ALL A SISTOM
Line_4082	BECAUSE ALL THE PICTHERS THAT YOU'RE IS SHOWING OR A SISTOM
Line_4083	BECAUSE IT CART IS A SISTOM
Line_4084	BECAUSE TH IT MEANS ARE A SUB SISTUM OF THE SISTUM
Line_4085	BECAUSE THE SISTOM HAS HELP ISTOMS
Line_4086	BECAUSE IT'S A SICTOM WITH THE BUNCHES DO BUNCH ARE DIFFERENT SOBE SISTOME
Line_4087	BECAUSE IT IS A ISTARMANI HAS LOTS OF OTHER LOTS OF OTHER SUB CISTOMS
Line_4088	JIECITIVE SISTIUM
Line_4089	REPETE THE STING THAN QUENCHEDE
Line_4090	THEY BOTH HAVE A DIJECTIVE CISTOM AND
Line_4091	THAT THE HART IS ONE JICISTME
Line_4092	WELL THE CIRCUILR CISTOM THAT IS AN SAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4093	STOPS ARE BEING BRAT INTO THE BODY
Line_4094	THE PART ARE SELILULES
Line_4095	BECAUSE IT IS ONE A CIRCUITORY SISTOM
Line_4096	BLOUD BLOUD HART AND JABLISLES
Line_4097	IT PUMPS LAS HA YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4098	THEY ARE THE BUT IT BUWESTLES ARE BUT THAT GOES IN YOUR ART AND THEN IT COMES OUT
Line_4099	LEARNING ABOUT SISTOMS
Line_4100	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4101	IT HAS A LOT OF AND DIRECTING PARTS
Line_4102	AS A SOB SISTOM AND A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4103	THEY ARE SOB CISTAMS
Line_4104	UM ALL OF IT'S INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4105	BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND THERE ARE FOU SOB SISTOMS IN THERE
Line_4106	IT IS A SOB SISTOM IN THE UNEVERSE AND IT CAN BE A OF IT'S OWN I GUESS
Line_4107	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4108	THERE ARE THREE THERE IS THE ATMEUS FER HIDRO FER AND THE I FORGOT THE LAST
Line_4109	THEY ARE PAR
Line_4110	I THINK IT'S THE FODWABA FODWAB
Line_4111	WELL THE EVERY THING GOES TO THE BACK TERIEA AND THE FONGIST WHEN IT DIES
Line_4112	SICSTOMS
Line_4113	THEY ARE ALL PART OF A FOD WEB
Line_4114	IT MAKES IT'S ON FOD FROM THE SUN
Line_4115	THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER ORGANISMS THEY MAKE SHIOGER FROM THE SUN WATER AND OCIGONE
Line_4116	THE GRASS IN THE PINE CONE
Line_4117	FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_4118	THE RABIT ILISERD THE BEL THE BLUGEY THE EL AND THE SNAKE
Line_4119	DECOMPOSING OTHER ORGANISUMS AND OTHER DED ORGANISOMS
Line_4120	BACK TERIEA AND FUNGI ARE D COMPOSERS
Line_4121	A YA PRODUCER IS MICING
Line_4122	FONE DHEY
Line_4123	THE MIXING ORGANISOM IS FUMIE
Line_4124	A PRODUCER IS MICSING HERE
Line_4125	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4126	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4127	TO EAT MEAT AND TO BE PLANS
Line_4128	CARNEBLRS ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_4129	OMNIBARS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_4130	A BRE IS OMENEBORE
Line_4131	TO EAT ONLY DED ORGANISOMS
Line_4132	THEY ONLY DED ORGANISMS AND YEAH
Line_4133	D COMPOSERS
Line_4134	A MOST IS A PURPLE
Line_4135	THE FOCX IS THE FOCX IS ON THE BUR
Line_4136	THIS IS A D COMPOSER
Line_4137	A RED WARM IS A D CONPOSERYEAH
Line_4138	I CLBASICALLY CLEAN UP
Line_4139	IT'S DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4140	IT'S WATER AND IT GROWES
Line_4141	THE EST IS ORGANISM AND THE EST IS KIND OF A D COMPOSER AND IT BREAKS DOWN THE COOKIE
Line_4142	THE EST NEEDS THE WATER TO BREAK DOWN THE COKE FOR OBSORBTION
Line_4143	THEY ARE D COMPOSERS AND THEY'RE USED ON BRED
Line_4144	WE WERE GROING LEAKED
Line_4145	HAS SOME LIGHT THE OTHER DOESN'T HAVE SOME LIGHT
Line_4146	THE ROUTS OF THE PLAN AND WATERING THE PLANT
Line_4147	WATER SUNLIGHT AND SWAIL
Line_4148	THOSE NEED WATER BUT IT NEEDS IT ALSO NEADS ORGAN AND NEEDS SUNLIGHT AND IT NEEDS NTROGAMS
Line_4149	THIS IS AIR PLANTS DO NEED AIR TO SORVIVE
Line_4150	SOME LIGHT AND NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_4151	NETRANTS PLANTS DO NEED NUTRANS TO SORVIVE
Line_4152	WLISER PLANTS DON'T NEED FERTALLISER BUT IT HELPS THE PLANTS
Line_4153	HOUSE IT'S ABOUT IT
Line_4154	UM YEA
Line_4155	UM IT SHOES WHAT WOULD HAPEN IF ONE OF THE MATERIALS WOULD GET RID OF
Line_4156	WANT
Line_4157	THERE IS NO AIR SO IT WOULD DIVE
Line_4158	CILLED IT ALMOST CILLED IT
Line_4159	TH WATER IT'S NOT AS BAD AS NO AIR BUT STEEL ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4160	THEY BOTH CILLED PLANS
Line_4161	IT'S ALL THREE HA GRAMS WITCH MAKES IT OPSOM AND YEAH
Line_4162	BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE NGRAMS
Line_4163	THEY'RE ON THE START OF THE FOOD IF THEIR WASN'T PRODUCERS THEN THE FOOL WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4164	FOOD WEBS AND SISTOMS AND LEAVES
Line_4165	IT'S EST IT'S EST
Line_4166	THAT EST IS LIVE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS A SELL OR SAL IS LIVE
Line_4167	IT'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF SELLS
Line_4168	I SEE SELLS OF ALEFF AND IT LOOKS SCOAL
Line_4169	I SEEN MUSLE SELLS
Line_4170	THAT THEIR MUSSL AND THEIR SELLES
Line_4171	IT SHOES ME THE BRAIN SELLS
Line_4172	I SEE REGULAR SELLS
Line_4173	SAN CELS CAN DROP DRY AND DIE
Line_4174	SCAND ONE BLUD ORGANS
Line_4175	AND HAVE MELLIAMS AND BILLAMS AND TRILLIES SELLS AND EAST ONLY AS ONE
Line_4176	THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_4177	I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4178	IT'S THE DIJECTIVE CISCTUM UH FOR HUMANS AND FOR BUTTERFLISE
Line_4179	WE BOTH HAVE SISTOMS
Line_4180	IT'S SHOWING THE THE DIJESTIVE SISTUM
Line_4181	I ORASE TOLD YOU IT BRINGS THE FOD DOWN TO THE STUMICK
Line_4182	THE CONTESCTAENTE OBSORBED THE WATER AND MESHRAINS
Line_4183	SURE DIJESTIVE SISTUM SELVES THOSE IN THE MAIN POINTS
Line_4184	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_4185	IT IS A LEAF AND VAINES
Line_4186	A PARALLEL L
Line_4187	IT'S A HAND I MIGHT LEAVE SO THAT BUG IN ME IT'S CITINGIT'S A HAND TALL MAY LIFE
Line_4188	I DEAH MAYBEAH CHAIN SALLIESE
Line_4189	THE EDGES LOOK LIKE A CHAIN SAW AND THE THINS AT LOOK LIKE A FEATHER SO MAYBE IT'S A FEATHER CHINE SIVE
Line_4190	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_4191	UM M I DON'T KNOW UM IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCUIT TORIEISTUM
Line_4192	A IT SHOES WATER
Line_4193	UM NOT VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4194	IRCIEA TORE CISTUM YEAH YEAH CIRCULAR TORA CISTOM FOR THE W
Line_4195	THE ILATORIES CISTOM FOR THE NE I TOLD YOU
Line_4196	THE HUMAN RESPETORIL CISTOM IS AIR CISTOM FOR THE WIND
Line_4197	UH OH CHEM COMES IN THE BODY AND SEE OH TWO COMES OUT OF THE BODDY
Line_4198	LONGINGS
Line_4199	UM THEY'RE IMPORTANT
Line_4200	IT GIVES OCODM TO A BLUD SCREEN AND IT TAKES OFF SEEL TO
Line_4201	IT'S AN FOUR PORTANT FOR YOUR BRIDE
Line_4202	YEAH
Line_4203	FROM A AND B NO IT WAS NOT A
Line_4204	THE UM A SOFT GUESS
Line_4205	UM I'M DOING OCAY UHM HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4206	I SERIESLLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IVE BEEN STUDYING IN SCIENCE
Line_4207	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_4208	IT HAS A CIRCLE TORE ST IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE AR AND IT COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE VAINGE AND THE HART PUMPS THE BLUD
Line_4209	E OW TOE OR CARBON DI OCKX SIDE
Line_4210	IT'S BLOOD AND THE BLUE PART ARE THE SELLS AND THE BLUE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING OR CARBONDIOCSIDE
Line_4211	VEANS AND ARTERY
Line_4212	I DO UM CANDY IS UH UM RPETE
Line_4213	IT PUMPS BLOUD
Line_4214	AM BLUB COMING IN AND OUT AND IT BEAM GROWS KIND OF
Line_4215	IT HOLES BLOD
Line_4216	THEY CARYED THEY CARYED BLUD
Line_4217	IT'S THE HARE IT BUMS BLUD
Line_4218	SEE CARYES THE BLUD TO THE SELLS
Line_4219	BLOWID TO THE SELL CARY BLUD TO THE SELLS
Line_4220	IT IS THE RECPRTORY SISTOM
Line_4221	IT'S BREATHING TO GET OCRIGON TO THE BLUD TO CARRY THE SELLS
Line_4222	IT'S BREATHING
Line_4223	IT TAKES OCTRAGM TO THE BLUD TO
Line_4224	UM IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ORGAN AND WESETORYS
Line_4225	THERE ARE TOBS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE THRAKE AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
Line_4226	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4227	THE TRAKE YEAH IT'S SEE STOP SH
Line_4228	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4229	THEY ALL LIVE ON ERTH THEY ALL ARE THINGS
Line_4230	IT IS TAPE IT'S A TYPE OF A CHAINE
Line_4231	THERE ARE SOBICTUMS IN THE COLOR
Line_4232	THERE IS THINGS THAT ARE LITTLE THAT ARE PARTS THAT GO IN THE SISTOM SO THAT WOULD BE CALLED A SUBCTUM
Line_4233	BECAUSE IT HAS SU SISTOMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_4234	YOU CAN SEE PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4235	THE SHAPE OF THE PHART
Line_4236	THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE HUMAN BODY
Line_4237	THEY'RE INTERACTING PARTS AND
Line_4238	UERTH WHICH IS AT
Line_4239	I THINK THE BIBLES FER
Line_4240	I THINK THE BILE FERE IS MADE OF WATER AND ANEMLES
Line_4241	BECAUSE THE BIBLE STEER IS IN THOSE PLACES
Line_4242	THE BORIEAL FORIST AND THE WED LAMS
Line_4243	ALL OF THE FODWES HAVE A HUMAN BEING IN IT
Line_4244	THAT EVERYTHING COMES FROM THE FOG AND THE BAG TERIEA
Line_4245	IT'S AN ORGANISM GETTING WHAT IT MNEADS
Line_4246	THEY'RE ADDING IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Line_4247	IT IS BACKTERIAL
Line_4248	NOFTHING WELL I DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_4249	WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LEAVING ORGANISUMS AND BELEIAVING THINGS AND ORGANISUMS
Line_4250	ONE OF THEM HAS HAD MORE WATER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4251	RATE
Line_4252	THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND IT IS GROWING
Line_4253	WATER AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4254	PLANTS DO NEED WATER JUST ARIVE BECAUSE HAT'S PRITY MUCH LIKE HUMANS FUELD FOR THEM THEY CAN LIVE WITH OUT IT NEITHER CON HUMANS
Line_4255	PLANTS NEED WATER TO LIVE AND TO GROW
Line_4256	IT IS SHOWING THE PICTURE AWAY PLANT AND A WATER ROW
Line_4257	UM AIR YOU CAN SEE BUT YOU CAN FEEL UM
Line_4258	YES I THINK THEY NEED MOST OF THE TIME
Line_4259	THE SUN IS SHINING DOWN ON THE PLAN
Line_4260	SOME LIGHTTWL
Line_4261	YES OT
Line_4262	YES STEFFINABLY
Line_4263	UM THIS IS A BERGER
Line_4264	YES YES
Line_4265	I THING FOD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ELSE IS LOT OR ELSE THE WALL WORK LIKE IT IS
Line_4266	IT WOULD BE A PROBUM BECAUSE LIKE PEOPLE PLANTS NEED FOLD TO SIVE
Line_4267	UM I'M NOT REALLY SHURE WILD H L H COULD YOU TELL MEY WHAT IT SHOWS
Line_4268	NOW
Line_4269	WELL NO BECAUSE FORDOISER CAN CILL THEM WHICH I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
Line_4270	IT'S A HOUSE
Line_4271	NO PLAMS DO NOT NEAD SHELTER TWO U
Line_4272	GREAIKT HOW ARE YOU
Line_4273	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT'S IN YOUR BODY
Line_4274	WE'VE BEEN TALKING OF THE HUMAN BODY AND
Line_4275	THEY BOTH HAVE SIMALAR BLUD CELLS I MEAN SELLS NOT BLUOD CELLS SELLS
Line_4276	IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4277	I SEE BLUE CELLS THE I SEE BLUE KIND OF SHORT SQUIGGLY WINES
Line_4278	THEY'RE ALL KIND OF TOGETHER THEY NEVER FLOW APART FROM EACH OTHER THE KIND OF LIKE A PAIR
Line_4279	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4280	UH I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT BUTTERFLISE
Line_4281	THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH THERE ARE VERY VERY MANY OF THEMUM
Line_4282	THE ES TRANS FERES THE BROKEN UP PIECES OF FOD DOWN TO THE STUMICK
Line_4283	THE SOCICS PLACE A BIG ROLE AND THE DIJUESICICUM TO MIX SURE THAT ALL THE FOD GETS DOWN TO THE STUMICK
Line_4284	TO TAKE THE FOD AND BRICK IT UP IN THE PIECES AND TO MAKE SURE TRANSFERS TO THE SMALL AND ESTIMATE
Line_4285	OH THAT IT PUTS IT INTO ALL THE WAIST IT PUTS IT IN THE WAIST AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4286	WHEN THE COOKIE GETS WET IT TURNS INTO ES
Line_4287	MAYBE BECAUSE THEIR A TYPE OF PLENT
Line_4288	GRASS AND IT'S IT IT'S GRASS AND IT'S TAPE IT'S A TAPE PLANE
Line_4289	ON THE LEFT THE GRASS IS A LITTLE MORE DECADE
Line_4290	BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME TIPE OF PAINT BUT ONE OF THEM IS MORE DECATED THAN THE OTHER
Line_4291	ONE ME IS PROBABLY NOT GOT AND AS MUCH WATER
Line_4292	THE PLANTS ALSO HAVE BASIC RUVEL NEEDS LIKE UM WITH WATER AND AND
Line_4293	SUN AND WATER
Line_4294	YES THEY NEED WATER TO SORVIVE AN BECAUSE AND WHENEVER SOMETHING IS D RATED IT WILL IT WILL D
Line_4295	I I THINK THEY DO NEED WATER BECAUSE UM IT PRITY MUCH EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS WATER HERS TO SORVIVE WITHOUT IT WE'D ALL BE HI DRY AND DIVE
Line_4296	ALL LIVING THINGS NEAD AIR TO BREATH
Line_4297	YES EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS AIR TO DIRIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T BREATH THEN THEY JUST DOP
Line_4298	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK PERS DO NEED AIR BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY'D ALL JUST THEY WOULN'T BE ABL TO BREATH AND IS JUST DIE
Line_4299	M PACE NEEDS SO TO SORVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWIZE UM THEY'D BE TWO COLD AND THEY AND THEN THEY THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_4300	WE GUESS BECAUSE THEN THEY'D GET TWO COLD AND DIVE
Line_4301	I SEE A PICTURE OF A HAMBERER AND A PLANT
Line_4302	YES IT WOULD DYE OF HUNGER AND UM THERE WOULD BE NO PEN
Line_4303	WITH THAT M CERTIFICFLOW TO UM IT PERANE WILL DIVE
Line_4304	IT YES IF AS DON'T GET FILLED THEY JUST
Line_4305	SOME KIND OF CAN AND LESS A MIXTURE OF AN APPLE A
Line_4306	UH YES BECAUSE IT'S A TYPE OF SOIL AND GRAMS NEED TO BE PUT IN SOIL JUSTOVIVE
Line_4307	IT'S NOT NEEDED BUT IT'S HELP HELP FILL THINGS FOR PLANES
Line_4308	UM IT'S A HOUSE WHICH COULD BE A TYPE OF SHELTER FOR PLANT
Line_4309	PONACITY CHILLTER WHEN IT'S LIKE COLD DURING LIKE THE WINTER AND OTHER TIMES
Line_4310	I ES I THINK THEY DO NEED UM SHELTER SO TO SORVIVE LATER OTHERWISE UM DURING THE WINTER THEY JUST FRASE UP AND DIVE
Line_4311	IT SHOES THAT UM PLANTS NEEDS SUNLIGHT WATER AND THEN W WATER CAN EVAPORATE FROM IT M
Line_4312	BECAUSE IT'S THERE MAN UM SOURCE NEEDS FOR SERVIVEL AND WITH OUT IT THEY WOULD UM JUST STOP
Line_4313	THE GIRL ANDY UM FEET ON RIGHT ENERGY
Line_4314	THEY DO MAKE I DON'T KNOW HOW
Line_4315	IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUFF SUNLIGHT
Line_4316	IT DOESN'T IT DIDN'T GET AN IT DOESN'T GET N OF SUNLIGHT
Line_4317	UM IT WON'T GET ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4318	IT LOOKS MORE MUCH MORE DECADE AND UMYEA AND OH AND SICKLY BECAUSE IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND WATER BUT NO AIR
Line_4319	IT GETS ENOUGH WATER AND SOME BUT NOT ENOUFF AIR
Line_4320	IT MAKES A DECAY EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES WITHOUT SUNLIGHT
Line_4321	IT NKTRICUITY TWO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER
Line_4322	IT HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY WATER BUT IT'S BEEN GETTING AIR AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4323	UHM WITH OUT WATER AND IT WILL UM D
Line_4324	THE IT DOES NOT LOOK STICK IT LOOKS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER SUNLIGHT AND AIR
Line_4325	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TWO MUCH OR TWO LITTLE OF WATER SOME OR AIR
Line_4326	THIS ONE HAS ENOUFF WATER AIR AND SONG
Line_4327	THE NE IS STICING HELHY
Line_4328	THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FEE ON EACH OTHER AND THEY ARE D COMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_4329	UH I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4330	THEY'RE PART OF THE ITER DOW
Line_4331	UM WITH OUT PRODUCERS UM I THE ODWEMS WOULD TH UM STU FLING P
Line_4332	THE STIR WITH THY COMPOSORS THEN PRODUCERS THEN THEY END WITH CONSUMERS
Line_4333	THE PLANTS NEED UM FOD AND WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SHELTER OR FERALLISED
Line_4334	UM THE HUMAN AND THE EST ARE BOTH MADE OF SELLS THEY ARE DIFFERENT TIPS OF CELLS BUT THEY'RE STILL SELLS
Line_4335	UM PLANTS ARE NOT SINGLE CELLED ORGANISOM SO THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE SEOW
Line_4336	UH H UM HUMANS ALSO HAVE SEVERAL A LOT OF SELLS
Line_4337	THERE ARE BRAIN CELLS AND WHICH ARE UM DIFFERENT
Line_4338	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT IT'S THAT THESE THAT THESE ARE BRAIN COWS
Line_4339	I SEE SKIN CELLS WHICH ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM BRAIN CELLS AND MUSL CELLS
Line_4340	THAT UM CELLS ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BODY
Line_4341	I DON'T THINK NOW
Line_4342	I
Line_4343	NOT THEY
Line_4344	THAT THEY
Line_4345	I DON'T THINK SO S
Line_4346	YEAH
Line_4347	I DON'T KNOW THERE'S TEN THE THAT GETS
Line_4348	RE AH
Line_4349	UH WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING SISTOM
Line_4350	THEY ALL INTERACT WITH PARTS OF THE CISTOM SO THEY WORK SO THE TOLE THING WOULD EXPLAIN
Line_4351	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE CARD WORK
Line_4352	ON THE INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE A SMOTHE
Line_4353	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4354	THE INTERACTING SUB SISTUMS THAT MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4355	AS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE HUMAN BODY WORK
Line_4356	IT HAS LOTS OF SUB SISTOMS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE ERTH WORK CORRECTLY
Line_4357	THEY INTERACT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ERTH LIKE IT IS
Line_4358	I SEE THE HIDROLIC ISTUM B
Line_4359	THERE'S EQUALS EGO SISTM
Line_4360	THE IRE SPEER IS LIVING THINGS
Line_4361	TH SPER IS ALL THE WATER AND THE WORLD
Line_4362	ECO CISTOMS LIVE ON THE IS SPER BECAUSE IS SPERS WATER AND WE NEED TO LIVE WITH WA
Line_4363	HUMAN BODY FISH THINS SORD WHATEVER
Line_4364	THIS IS THE ONE OF THE ECO CISTOMS FOR FORESTS THIS ALSO SHOERES A FOOD CHAIN
Line_4365	OR HOW PRODOTORS EAT OTHER SMALLER THING
Line_4366	SOMETHING EATS SOMETHING THE THING THAT GETS EAT ENERGY TRANSUERS TO A THING THAT EIGHT IT
Line_4367	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT CYCLES PRODUCERS CONSUMERES AND D COMPOSEORS ARE ALL PART OF THE LIGHT CYCLES
Line_4368	IT MAKEIS UM FRLOUGID BYS FOO C
Line_4369	THEY DO NOT EAT OTHER ORGAN
Line_4370	THE BATHERIALFON PINE TREE AND GRA
Line_4371	YOU EAT OTHER LIVING ORGANISOM
Line_4372	THEY EACH OTHER LIVING OR
Line_4373	THE RABIT STANDIMAT SAND SALAMANDER BEL SPARAL RED TILE HOCK AND S
Line_4374	IT EATS DED ORGANISOMS
Line_4375	THE FONYGIE AND THE BACK THERE
Line_4376	IT'S ABOUT WHAT PLANTS AND ANIMLES EAT
Line_4377	SODER AND MAGNET ARE EREFOR
Line_4378	YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT
Line_4379	THEY EAT MEAT OR DECAING MEATS AND BARIES OR DECARING ME BE
Line_4380	A CINOFVUR OR AN RIV
Line_4381	AREBEVEORI
Line_4382	THEY BREAK DOWN THE THE BAD DECAYING MATTER AND MAKE IT SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE ERTH AND SWAIL
Line_4383	UDNING ABOUT A DIJESCTIVE SISTOM
Line_4384	IT HAS TO DO WITH THE EST THING THE FEST WILL GO
Line_4385	IT'S SWACHING E GROW OUT OF ITS DORMENT STAGE
Line_4386	I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO GET EAST OUT OF IT'S DORMET ST
Line_4387	I THINK THE SOLS ARE OF THE ES
Line_4388	WE'VE BEEN DOING AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHICH TO SEE IF WET WILL GO IN DARK BAGS AND WE WILL IN LIGHT BAGS
Line_4389	THE UN HELTHY LOOKING ONE WAS GROWN IN THE DIRCK BAG
Line_4390	IT'S SHORING US HOW FOO HOW THE PLANTS FOOD IS T
Line_4391	CARBON DIOCKSIDE SUNLIGHT WATER
Line_4392	NEEDS NUTRIENTS TO SORVIDE
Line_4393	IT SHOWES THE CARON WITH THE TOMADORE
Line_4394	THERE IS A HOUSE AND AND HOW N
Line_4395	IT SHOWES HOW POR SMICIS WORKS AND AND WHAT FAR SIMICIC NEEDS TO WORK
Line_4396	SO THEY COULD GET FU FROM BOTTLES A BY
Line_4397	IT CRIPLED IT AND IT'S DIME
Line_4398	THE PLANT NEEDS ALL THROUGH THINGS TO SERVIVE AND MAKE ITS OWN ENERGY
Line_4399	IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS IT NEEDS FOR TWO SORVIVE SO IT IS GROWING QUIGHT NEITY
Line_4400	IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO SERVIV
Line_4401	VENTUALLY THE ENERGY FROM THE PLANTS COMES UP TO HOCKX IGGLES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_4402	ALLOW HEALLOW AND GOOD BYE
Line_4403	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CICTUMS AND SO SISTOMS
Line_4404	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AND DIRACTING PARTS
Line_4405	IT HAS DIFFERENT AND TORACTING PART
Line_4406	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR HOW DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4407	IT HAS ATRACTING PARTS THAT HELPS IT WORK AND IF ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS WEREN'T THERE IT WOUDN'TE
Line_4408	ALL OF THE INTERACTING PURNTS
Line_4409	CAUSE IT HAS MANY PARTS THAT MAKES THE BODY WORK
Line_4410	ALL OF THEY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4411	IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND SOFF CISTOMS LIKE ANIMALES AND HUMANS AND PLANTS
Line_4412	TALKING ABOUT SISTUMS AND IT'S ALSO
Line_4413	ABOUT CICTUMS AND SLIT
Line_4414	BECAUSE THEY HAVE MANY INTRACTING PART
Line_4415	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKES IT MOVE AND THE CANTRACTING PARTS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S MAKING IT WORK
Line_4416	IT HAS MANY DIFFANT INTERECTING PARTS THAT CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO THE WHOLE BODY A
Line_4417	WELL WITH OUT ANY OF THESE THE THE WHOLE SISTUOM MOTO WORK
Line_4418	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY INTRACTING PARTS AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE ATTRACTING PARTS IT WOULDN'T BE HOLS
Line_4419	UM A
Line_4420	I DOT HERE IS ABOUT PLANTS US FISHES AND WATERS
Line_4421	THEY SHOW WHAT ANIMALES EAT EACH OTHER AND WHAT ANIMLS ARE EN BY OTHER AS TECOSIS
Line_4422	IT'S DOING I'M DOING GOOD THINK YOU
Line_4423	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE CIRCUIS
Line_4424	WE PUT WAX PAPER ON THE BLUE CIRCUIS
Line_4425	WATER SLIDES DOWN A SLOWP
Line_4426	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER TO ONE DROP AND LESS WATER TO ANOTHER DROP AND THAT'S BAICALLY HOW IT WORKS
Line_4427	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE SLOWP
Line_4428	WE DID NOT USE THE ROCK OR THE PAPER CLIP BUT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BOTH SUNK
Line_4429	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_4430	KIND OF UN WITH THE OTHER WATER BECAUSE A KIND OF GOT IT STIRED OR MIXED BY AXIDENT
Line_4431	COLD WATER IT'S DENSER THAN RUM TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT ETHER STAYS IN THE FIL OR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_4432	WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING WITH ISE AND WATER
Line_4433	THEY WOULD BE LIQUIDS
Line_4434	WHEN WATER COALES IT GETS DENSER
Line_4435	UM DENCITY IS MAKING THE WATER LEVEL DROP BELOW ROUM TEMPERATURE
Line_4436	IS IS ACTUALLY LESS DENSE THAN WATER BECAUSE IT FLOWS
Line_4437	THAT TELLS ME THAT ONE THAT THE COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN REGULAR WATER
Line_4438	OH WATER CREATES LESS DANCITY SO THAT'S SPASICALLY WHAT IT DOES
Line_4439	WHEN YOU PUT WATER IN THE FRESER IT TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND IT BECOMES A SOLID
Line_4440	IT GETS LESS DENSE CAUSING THE WATER TO RISE
Line_4441	WATER TAKES UP MORE SPACE AS IT IS HEATED
Line_4442	IT MEANS TO SOLITIFYD I THINK
Line_4443	E WATER ON THE CIRCUISS IS EVAPORATING OVER TIME
Line_4444	IT TURNS OUT MY MYCROPONE WAS NOT IN THE PROPER POSITION SO THAT'S WHAT YOU COULDN'T HER ME BUT I COULD HEAR YOU
Line_4445	THE UN COVERED WE PAPER TOWLE
Line_4446	HAS MORE WATER IN IT BECAUSE THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HASE COMPLETELY EVAPORATED
Line_4447	THE W PAPER TILES STAYED WHAT BECAUSE THE PLASTIC LID IS STEELLING IN THE HUMANETY
Line_4448	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4449	THE WATER ON THE CIRCUISCS IS EXPOSED TO HEAT WHICH CAUSED EVAPORATION
Line_4450	THE WATER ON THE CIRCIS IS TOUCHING THE AIR CAUSING IT TO BE ABLE TO EVAPORATE
Line_4451	THE WATER ON THE CIRCUISS IS EVAPORATING
Line_4452	WHEN WATER VAPER TOUCHES A COLD CUP IT FORMS CONENSATION WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST
Line_4453	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS REALLY COLD
Line_4454	I THINK THE DROP ARE THE WATER ON THE LID OR MOTOR DROP LITS SO THAT BASICALLY IS
Line_4455	THE WATER DROP ITS FORMED IN THE SIDE THE CONCENATION CHAMBER SO IT BASICALLY IS
Line_4456	WEE OBSERVED THAT THE CONDENSATION WAS IN THE IN SIDE WITH OWER ACTUAL CONDENSATION CHAMBERS
Line_4457	THE WATER HAS TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE CUP BUT WITH THE LID IT DIFIDES EVAPORATION
Line_4458	IT IS REALLY COAL BECAUSE IT JUST AMAUSES ME
Line_4459	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOIL AND GRAVEL
Line_4460	I SEE A PILE OF SOIL AND A PILE OF GRAVEL
Line_4461	I KNOW THAT WATER CAN FLOW THROUGHE SOIL AND WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH GRAVER
Line_4462	THEY WENT WELL THEY ACT THEY ACT DIFFERENTLY WITH EACH OTHER
Line_4463	WHAT WE CAN SPIND WATER WE ALL TO MAKE UH
Line_4464	FIVE OF THE RED THINGS THREE OF THEE
Line_4465	IT IS A ATE MILL WHICH HELPS POWER THE HOUSE AND YOU ALREADY ASCKED ME THIS QUESTION
Line_4466	THIS IS SPACICALLY WHAT WE DID AND
Line_4467	UM FORCE AND THE OTHER BLADE IS RIGHT THERE SO THAT KEEPS ITS SPINING AS LONG AS THERES SO FLOW OF WATER
Line_4468	BYE MARNEY I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU
Line_4469	I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4470	WE HAVE BEEN STUDING WATER AND UM IT'S PROPERTIES
Line_4471	THE WATER IS MAKING BEADS ON THE ALUMINIUM FILE
Line_4472	THE PAPER TAIL HAS OBSORVED THE WATER
Line_4473	THE PAPER TEL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER LEAVING A TINY MARK
Line_4474	THE SMALLER DROP LITS CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A BIGGER DROP LIT
Line_4475	WHAT ARE ON DIFFERENT CIRCUICES CAN
Line_4476	THE WATER OR THE PAPER TAIL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER
Line_4477	THE SILPY WATER DECREASES THE CIRYS TENCION WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIRCUICS TENION
Line_4478	THE CAUSING THE WATER TO NOT RISE INSIDE WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIRCUICE TEN
Line_4479	YES STRBLTS OF WATER ARE COMING OUT
Line_4480	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH WATER
Line_4481	CIRCUISCE TENTION IS HAPINING
Line_4482	CIRCUISCE TENON IS THE PROPERTY THAT KEEPS WATER TOGETHER AND NOT IN A THIN LINE
Line_4483	SALT WATER HAS NO EFFECT AND IT ACTS LIKE PLAIN WATER
Line_4484	THE DULL NOT TO BELLS HI
Line_4485	MARNEY I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4486	UM THE BULB STARTED AT THE SIDE OF THE DESC AND WE DROPED IT AND IT WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4487	BECAUSE ALL EVERYONE
Line_4488	I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE TO DAY
Line_4489	THE BULB AND UM
Line_4490	HOW MANY NUMBERS IF OF SWINGS THERE ARE
Line_4491	AND UM PUT ETHER ONE OF THEM ON THE STICK AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4492	YOU PUT THEM IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER STICKS THAT ARE GLOED ON TO THE FLIPPER BACE ER THE THE FLIPPER STICK
Line_4493	IT HELPS IT UM
Line_4494	WELL I DON'T ACTUALLY MAK ABLE SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4495	I UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YO'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN MAKE REALLY MUCH SENCE
Line_4496	UM FU LENGTH SO STRING SO
Line_4497	THE RA RELATION SHIP BETWEEN IT
Line_4498	LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT'S GOING TO DO WHEN TEN SECUANTS AND YEAH
Line_4499	THE PUNULLUM LENG
Line_4500	UM IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWIT LIKE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM IS DOING
Line_4501	MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE BEEN
Line_4502	IT AND IT AND IT WOULD STINK FASTER THAN IT WOULD IF YOU HAD CUP THAT'S UM WILL A BIT LONGER
Line_4503	MAY NOT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD LIKE US
Line_4504	UM HAS THE CAPACITY GOES UP YOU HOLE IT HOLDS LIKE MORE PACANGERS
Line_4505	OH THE NUMBER OF PASSANGURS THE MORE YOU'RE DOING THE SHOURTER THE DISTANCE IT'S CAN NOT GO
Line_4506	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_4507	YOU WOULD PROBALY COUNT LIKE BY TEN ER FIVE MAYBE
Line_4508	THE OH THE EX AXIS TELLS US HOW MANY REBERBANS LIGHT THERE ARE
Line_4509	THE MORE RIVER BAMS THERE ARE THE FARTHER IT'S GOING IT'S GOING TO GO
Line_4510	IT'S GOING UH
Line_4511	THAT IT'S GOING DOWN AND STEAD OF GOING UP
Line_4512	UM THERE ABOUT UM LIKE HOW THING LIKE HOW THEY MOVE LIKE HOW TO KEEP ON SPINNING
Line_4513	IT'S A PANJULLUM THE PANY IS WHAT KEEPS IT SPINNING
Line_4514	IT KEEPS ON SPINING AT THE SAME LEVEL
Line_4515	UM ONE WILL SWING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN SLOW DOWN TO WILL GO LONGER AND THEN SO AND SO
Line_4516	UH THE THIRTY EIGHT ONE IT WILL SWING FER
Line_4517	IT WILL SWING EIGHT SWINGS FOR IN FIFTEEN SECUANTS
Line_4518	SO THE SHORTER ONE UM SWING LONGER AND THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER
Line_4519	UM THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY SWING THE LEAST AMOUNT
Line_4520	UM TODAY WE STARTED UM MAKING UM CAPPULBES
Line_4521	UM IT'S IT'S GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING
Line_4522	UM THE THE PAPER CLIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU CO COULDN'T CLIP ANYTHING WITH IT
Line_4523	UM ON THIS THERE IS UM UH JUST A PLAIN CORK LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE RUBBER CORCK
Line_4524	UH YOU COULD DISCRIBE THE FLIP STICK ABOUT UM
Line_4525	TWENTY CEVAN CENTIMETERS
Line_4526	UM WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING PAD PANGULUMS AND WE STARTED DOING UM GRAPS ABOUT THEM TODAY
Line_4527	UM IT IT WOULDN'T BE A CONTROL VARIABLE
Line_4528	UM WELL THIS ONE IS ABOUT UM HOW LONG THE STRING IS AND HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID
Line_4529	THE SHORTEST LENGTH THE STRING IS SWING IN THE MOST AND THEN THE LONGES STRING IS SWING IN THE LEAST
Line_4530	COULD YO YOU USE UM A GRASS AND YEAH
Line_4531	IN THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4532	UM WE STARTED TO DY LEARNING ABOUT LIF ABOUT BOTHS AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4533	WELL WE FIRST PUT THE BOT IN WITH NO NO PANELS IN IT
Line_4534	UM MAYBE MAKING THE BOT HIGHER OR LONGER TO FIT MORE PEOPLE IN
Line_4535	THE BO T WOULD HIT THE BOTTOM AND LIKE JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP WITH OUT GET ANY WATER IN IT
Line_4536	UM YOU CAN IT'S A CONTROL ING A GOOD VARIABLE IS ONE ELL UM ONLY SWITCH ONE THING OUT A TIME
Line_4537	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOTHS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4538	UM THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE PANIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4539	UM IS TELLING YOU H THE NUMBER OF THE CUP AND HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_4540	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND UM FLY IN THEM ON FISHING WIRE
Line_4541	UM YOU L WANT TO
Line_4542	HE INDIPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4543	NUMBER OF WINDS
Line_4544	UM SO THE THE ONES WITH OUT THE PAPER CLIPS GO IS THE FARTHEST AND THE ONES WITH THE MOST PAPER CLIPS GOES THE LEAST
Line_4545	UM THAT IF YOU DID CHANGE THEM IT WOULD AFFECT HOW IT FLIYS
Line_4546	UM I WANTED TO FIGGER OUT IF IF YOU HAD MORE ON UM HOW WOULD IT OFFECT HOW IT FLOWS
Line_4547	CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED ALL OF THE ALL OF THEIR MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4548	HOW FAR THE DIS I MEAN JUST THE DISTANCE
Line_4549	UH THE NUMBER OF PASSONGURS
Line_4550	UM WE ARE TRYING TO FIGGER OUT IF THE DISTANCE GOES UP WHEN WE ADD PASSONGERS OR IF IT GOES DOWN WHEN WE ADD PASONGERS
Line_4551	UM WELL YOU HAVE TO YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME OR ELSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4552	UM YOU GET MORE ACURET UM ANSWERS AND THINGS
Line_4553	UM THE MOTOR WHICH IS THE REAVER MANE AND THE DISTANCE
Line_4554	UM ON THE Y AXIS UM IT SHELLS THE THAT JUST TURMES TO FIND FOG
Line_4555	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DIPENNT OR UH UNDIPENDENT VARIABLE IS
Line_4556	UM I NOTICE THAT UM IN DIPENDENT VARIBLE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BEFOR AND THEN DIPENDENT VARIBLES IS WHAT WE LEARNED
Line_4557	U WILL FIND THE DIPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4558	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LASS POWER YOU SAID
Line_4559	UM THIS POINT IS UM CAP STAYING THE SAME SO THAT MAKE IT A STREAGHT LINE
Line_4560	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING UM THE FILIPPER BASE AND UM WE DID THE GRASS SOD Y
Line_4561	UM THIS SPACE IT STICK IT IN SO THAT YOU COULD BALANCE THE CHICK
Line_4562	UM IT UM ROWS THE ONE UM AND THE TWO SAM AND THREE CAMS
Line_4563	UM YOU HAVE TO MIX SURE THAT'S UM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND NOT THE OPOSIT AH LIGKHES FRUM
Line_4564	UM I NOTICE STARES CORCK CORCK AND WOODEN BULB AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THEM ARE
Line_4565	I SEE THAT THE PLASTIC BULB IS SPMOUNSING ON THE WALE AND IT BALANCE BACK
Line_4566	I THINK YOU HAVE READY SHOW ME THIS PIXTURE
Line_4567	IT HAS TO HIGH THE HEIGHT SO THAT CAN HELP IT LIKE GO UM GO FARTHER
Line_4568	UM PAIOM LENCE AND NUMBER OF TWAMES
Line_4569	UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE UM THE LENCE AND THE STRING
Line_4570	IT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF STRAINUM EITHER LONG LARGER OR SMALLER
Line_4571	UM WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING THE SWINGS THAT YOU PULL ONE STRAIN DOWN AND MAKE SOMETHING SWINGS
Line_4572	ITS E SCRAP AND WYE BARE
Line_4573	THE NUMBER OF STRAINGE SWITCHES FROM TEN TO TO HUNDRED
Line_4574	ABOUT THE HIGHT AND WHICH IS THE CAP HAS CAPACITY
Line_4575	I DON'T GET IT I CAN CLICK THE PANEIESE
Line_4576	UM I TRIDED TO CLIK BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_4577	I KNOW THAT UM D IS WILL BE BIGGER AND
Line_4578	AND A WILL BE SMALLER BO THAT UM THO THEY'RE IS ALL THE SAME HIGHT AS THREE CENTIMETERS
Line_4579	YOU SHE ONLY CHANGE ONE VARABLE AT IT TIME TO SEE IT'S DIFFERENT NOT CHANGE LIKE THREE OR FOR VARIBLES AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT
Line_4580	I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT SHOW MEAN THIS UM PIXTURE
Line_4581	OF CORE IF THE WATER IS MOVING I THINK THE PANY WILL TIP OR THE WATER WILL GO N
Line_4582	TODAY ME AND MY PARONEAG JUST MAKE THE PLANT SO
Line_4583	NO WE'RE GETTING GET TO PUT THE FI LON TO OUR PIN
Line_4584	YOU JUST ACT MEAN THAT QUESTION
Line_4585	UM ONE OF THE STRAINES STRATER AND ONE THE STRAINER CILOSER
Line_4586	I THINK THIS ONLY HAS ONE VIRCLE CHANGED
Line_4587	WELL I THINK YOU CAN UM SLIGHT MORE ON THIRSEDAYS AND DON'T GUESS SLEEBE ON FRIDAYS
Line_4588	OH JUST A MEAN THAT UM WHAT'S A MINUTE YOU'RE GO
Line_4589	WE CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS UM WE D TO FOR SIX EIGHT TEN
Line_4590	YOU CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS AND THIS EXAMPLE
Line_4591	SURE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4592	IT'S ABOUT H IT'S A GRASS AND THERE IS A WYE AND EX AXIS
Line_4593	THAT'S TO SEE HOW YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T K HAVE WIRE EX AXIS IS AND
Line_4594	YOU ARE TO ASCK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4595	YEAH M THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IS THE VARIABLE ON THE TABLE OF DATA
Line_4596	YO ORY AS BE THAT
Line_4597	THINGS FOR ALL YOUR HELP TO
Line_4598	HEY WITH YEAH BYE
Line_4599	WE GOT DIFFERENT LE OF STRINGS AND SEE HOW MANY SWINGS IT WOULD MAKE IT FIFTEEN SECUANTS
Line_4600	WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG PIECOF STRING YOU'LL HAVE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS AND FIFTEEN CECUANTS
Line_4601	THERE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PANDREUMS
Line_4602	IN FIFTEEN SECANTS IT DID FIVE SWINGS
Line_4603	A PANY AND A PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4604	BUB MAKES THE STRING SWING
Line_4605	THE LONGER THE STRING LA THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWANG THE PANSULM WILL MAKE
Line_4606	WE JUST FINISHED UP THE PONGEN ONE LIKE BAROMAT
Line_4607	IT'S ABOUT THE PEANULUM LENGTH AND THE NUMBER HAVE SWINGS THE PAUL MAKES
Line_4608	CAN FIGEAR OUT HOW MANY OF SOMETHING
Line_4609	WHEN YOU USE A GRASS IT TELLS YOU D
Line_4610	WHEN YOU USE A GRAFT TO HELP YOU PRODICT YOU CAN GET A BETTER CONCLUSION
Line_4611	WITH THE TWENTY MITER STRING YOU WILL GET FIFTEEN SWREENS
Line_4612	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BULBS
Line_4613	PAPER BOTHS AND WE ARE SEEN HOW MUCH CAPACITY AND PPACONGUERS A BOT CAN HOLD
Line_4614	EY ARE LIGHT BULBS BUT WE MADE THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4615	THERE WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT IT WE JUST TUSTED TO SEE HOW IT WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT DIDN'T
Line_4616	IF YOU PUT TO MANY PON PANIES AND ONE BOUT IT
Line_4617	WELL IF YOU SSTACKL THE PENNIES
Line_4618	OKAY THANK OU BIYE
Line_4619	WE FINISHED MAKING OUR BOTS AND THEN WEE GRAFED ALL OUR BOTS PLUSS TWO OTHERS
Line_4620	IT TOLD MY WHAT THE
Line_4621	YOU ASC ME THAT QUESTION AS TIME LIKE THE LAST THING YOU SAID
Line_4622	THE PLAIN IS MOVING ACROSS THE STRING
Line_4623	WOULD SEE THAT YOUR PLAIN WON'T FLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
Line_4624	WE ONLY FLUE AT ONE DISTANCE THAT WAS TWO YEARDS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANY OTHER DISTANCES
Line_4625	ONE PLAIN IS GOING ON A STREAK STRING AND THE OTHER PLAIN IS LIKE DOING IN LIKE A DAGNEL
Line_4626	I LIKE VISITING WITH YOU TWO
Line_4627	ANS AND CRAFTING
Line_4628	WELL IN THE GRASS I COULD
Line_4629	UM WELL M THE PAN A VARIABLE WOULD BE LIKE YES SWITCH ONE VARIABLE AT THE TIME
Line_4630	THINK YOU
Line_4631	ARE WE OUT OF TIME ER NOT
Line_4632	PUT I TEPED IT ON THE T LE AND SWONG IT THIFTY TIMES
Line_4633	E TO PA THEM GRAFF
Line_4634	HELP YOU WITH THE MASS
Line_4635	SWING LIKE O AND SWANGED
Line_4636	CHEITER
Line_4637	UM STRAIN WILL GO LONGER AT TEEM
Line_4638	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4639	IN SCIENCE I COULD THINK OF ANY SO I DON'T CHANGE ANY
Line_4640	WAS ABOUT TESTING YOUR PER YES TO SEE HOW FAR IT WANT
Line_4641	LEING AND THE DISTANCE THE CORK FLU
Line_4642	UM THAT THE BULL ON THE TOP IS BIGGER AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS
Line_4643	IT SAS THAT THEY BOTH ME ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4644	THE ANG
Line_4645	OBJECT AND MASS LINK DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE
Line_4646	HUH SOTAY
Line_4647	BECAUSE MAYBE OTHER THINGS WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE GRAFE
Line_4648	I DO MAIN DIFFERENT THINGS EVERY TIME
Line_4649	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4650	WE WERE DOING THE PLAINS AND MAKING GRAFS AND TOUSTING THEM
Line_4651	A STRING WITH PAPER CLIP AND THEN PUT A PANY
Line_4652	S STRING PAPER CLIP AND PANY
Line_4653	I NOTICE THAT THE SMALL ONE DID THE MOST
Line_4654	THE BIG ONE D THE LESS I MEAN DID THE MEDIAM
Line_4655	NO SHARE I NOT
Line_4656	STREIEN PAPER CLIP ANY
Line_4657	LONGER OR SHORTER STRENGTH
Line_4658	LONG OR SWITH STRING
Line_4659	SMALLER OR DIFFERENT PAPER CLIP
Line_4660	SMALLER PANY SMALLER CIND OF CINE OR PAPER CLIP OR MORE PAPER CLIP
Line_4661	A PANGILUM WITH STRING A PAPER CLIP AND PENTY AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4662	LIKE BOTS
Line_4663	MMM THEY ARE MADE OF CUPS
Line_4664	THEY'RE MADE A B THEY'RE MADE OF PAPER CIPS
Line_4665	WEE GOT PAPER CUPS AND WE GOOD A DICTIONARY AND WEE
Line_4666	WE MADE LINES ON THE CUP AND WE C WA THAT WAS TO MAKE BO
Line_4667	SMALL BE BIG
Line_4668	THEY ARE BOTHS
Line_4669	PUTTING DIME OR PANIES FOUR PASSINGURS IN THE BOLT
Line_4670	FOR MY BOLTS SMALL WAS SEVAN UM B WAS TWENTY FIVE TO MAKE IT INK
Line_4671	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_4672	PASANGERS AND BOTS
Line_4673	THE ONE THE TWENTY HAS MORE THAN THE ONE OF THE TWELVE
Line_4674	BOTS WITH PASSAGES AS PANIES
Line_4675	MAKE IT AN ECTRAL BOT
Line_4676	MAKE IT BIGGER CAMPACITY
Line_4677	GOOD
Line_4678	MEASURING THE MASS AND THE VOLT OF THINGS
Line_4679	FIFTY MILLILITERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SMALLER CIRCUIT
Line_4680	A GRADUATED SILINDER
Line_4681	IT GOES UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE MAN ONLY GOES UP TO FIFTY
Line_4682	SO LIKE IF YOU PUT WATER IN YOULD KNOW HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER YOU HAVE
Line_4683	YOU MEASURED THE VOLUTE OF THINGS
Line_4684	THE THE VOLUTE OF THINGS
Line_4685	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4686	WELL FIFTY MILLLITERS IS
Line_4687	WHAT IS CAPACITY
Line_4688	IT HOLD CA THE CAPACITY OF IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4689	WE ON DO A MEASURING OF WATER WITH THREE CUPS
Line_4690	HOW HOT OR COLD THE WATER IS
Line_4691	WHAT IS THE HOTEST WHAT IS THE COLDEST
Line_4692	UHM NOING THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_4693	WELL YOUR FINGER CAN TELL THE EXACT TEMPERATURE WHIT THE THERMOMETER CAN
Line_4694	WA STANDARD TOLE
Line_4695	SILCIES AND FAR AND HIGH
Line_4696	WELL YOU COULD USE FAR AND HOW YOU DON'T ALWAISE HAVE TO USE FACES UNLESS YOU LIKE NEED TO
Line_4697	IT GET THE COLDER
Line_4698	WELL IT'S FIFTY DIGRES CATS AND IT'S MORE MAR THAN TEN DIGREES SCES
Line_4699	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT CAN'T BE HIER THAN FIFTY
Line_4700	WELL E
Line_4701	UH ABOUT WAT
Line_4702	WELL EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_4703	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVE MEANS
Line_4704	OH OKAY
Line_4705	WE USED THE CHART
Line_4706	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WITH THE ISE IN IT
Line_4707	ING HOTTER IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE GETTING COLDER AND IT MIGHT BE GETTING HOTTER
Line_4708	IT DROPED RABID
Line_4709	M UH WELL
Line_4710	ALLY BUB JO BILLY BILLY HI HI
Line_4711	YEAH IT DOUS
Line_4712	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4713	ABOUT MEASURING THINGS
Line_4714	UM IN CLASS WE USE STRAWS WHICH WAS KIND OF HARD
Line_4715	I THINK MY FREND NIKIS MAYBE A METER I THINK
Line_4716	TO THE IT IT'S LIKE THE DOOR NOB FROM A DOOR YEAH NICK IS REALLY SHORT
Line_4717	YOU COULD YOU COULD USE YOUR UM YOUR PINKE AND YOUR THUM TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4718	CIND OF LIKE GUESING
Line_4719	YOU SPRED YOUR HAND APART WITH YOUR PINKE AND YOUR THUM
Line_4720	UM NOT EXACTLY SHURE
Line_4721	MIKE SURE IT'S ACURET AND LIKE EXACT
Line_4722	I AM HOW ARE THO
Line_4723	I NEVER SEAD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_4724	UM MOST LIKE WE A METER STICK
Line_4725	NOT SHURE
Line_4726	TO MAKE SHURE LIKE YOU PUT IT YOU HAVE IT STRAIGHT METAL LIKE FAT AND FOLDED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4727	WE MEASURED OUR ARMS OUR RIST TO OUR ELBOW OUR FOOT AND OUR HEIGHT
Line_4728	WE CAN MEASURE OUR NOSIS
Line_4729	MAYBE A FOOT
Line_4730	YOU'RE USING YOUR PINKE FOR EACH CENTIMETER
Line_4731	I DON'T KNOW OH
Line_4732	NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME FOR ME AT LEAST MAYBE FOR OTHER PEOPLE SOME ARE THE SAME
Line_4733	THAT HIS ARM AND HIS HEIGHT ARE THE EXACT SAME
Line_4734	SOME ARE BIGGER THAN OTHER RODDY PARTS AND SOME ARE SMALLER
Line_4735	UH TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4736	U CAN USE YOUR UM IN YOUR PINKE TO MEASURE TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4737	UM A PENSLE
Line_4738	ILL UM I JUST LIKE STOPED RIGHT THERE
Line_4739	THEY ARE THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE THE SAME SIZE IT DEPENDS OF ON HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4740	THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT LIKE THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT SIZES YEAH
Line_4741	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4742	I DON'T KNOW ALL
Line_4743	ONES HEAVIER BECAUSE IF IT'S HEAVIER IT WAIMS IF IT'S LIGHTER IT DOESN'T MEAN IT STAYS UP
Line_4744	UM NOT SHURE
Line_4745	I'M NOT SHUR
Line_4746	THAT ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER AND ONE OF THEM IS SMALLER
Line_4747	UM THERE IS TWENTY FIVE GRAMS THERE IS TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAM MISS ONE GRAM
Line_4748	GOOD BYE I HAVE TO GO
Line_4749	IT I CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4750	HUM WA
Line_4751	IT'S ABOUT LIKE TWENTY GRAMS AND YEAH JUST ABOUT GRAMS
Line_4752	UM THE THE WASHER THE METAL CHIP AND THE WOOD CHIP
Line_4753	TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS THE BE BEER RANG IS
Line_4754	NOT T NOT EXACTLY SHURE
Line_4755	THAT UM
Line_4756	UM YOU WOULD
Line_4757	HERE'S NOT ENOUFF GRAMS FER FOR T TO BE THE SAME MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_4758	I THINK IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED
Line_4759	YOU WEIKE MASS AND STUFF
Line_4760	THAT UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4761	THIN
Line_4762	UM I DON'T KNOW I WON'T EXACTLY SHUR
Line_4763	I NON'T REALLY REMAMBREK
Line_4764	IT'S SPONGEES DRY WET AND SOCK
Line_4765	THE SOK SPOUNGE IS REALLY HEAVY
Line_4766	IT'S JUST A DRY SPONGE IT'S THE DRY SPONGE IN A CUP HEAVIER RIVEN NOFTHING
Line_4767	IF YOU DON'T KNOW OR IF YOU DO KNOW
Line_4768	THAT WE SPUNGE IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN UM
Line_4769	UM IT'S IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SPONGCH IT'S THAT HEAVIER
Line_4770	UM IT WAS IT WAS
Line_4771	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER AS USUAL
Line_4772	M EXACTLY SHARE
Line_4773	UM NOT SHIURE
Line_4774	THERE IS NOFTHING IN SIDE OF THEM
Line_4775	THAT GOT SCUIPED YESTERDAY
Line_4776	CULPS H
Line_4777	THEY'RE ARE
Line_4778	THE WATER AND THE CUP WELL THE VOLUM THE VOLIUM AND THE CUP
Line_4779	PORING IT INTO A DIFFERENT CUP LIKE DROPS LITTLE DROPS
Line_4780	YEAH THEY'RE ABOUT
Line_4781	S S TALKING ABOUT THEM JUST MILLIMETER LILLMMILLMETER MILLLIETERS
Line_4782	TEN TEN MAKE LITER
Line_4783	THE SEEING HOW MUCH MILLILITERS YOU OF WATER AND YOUR CUP
Line_4784	UM I'M MUCH
Line_4785	EARUH LITER OR NO UM A REAR I THINK
Line_4786	IT'S A SERRINGE WITH WATER IN IT AND IT'S GET A SQUEESE OUT WATER
Line_4787	LOOK AT THIS YOU WOLD LOOK AT THIS RENGE BECAUSE IT SHOWES ON THE RENE
Line_4788	IT REPROENTS THE MIDLMETERS AT THAT'S ON THE CIRINGE
Line_4789	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETERS AND METERS AND SERANGE AND LIKE GRAGURATED SILANDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4790	UM IT WAS YEAH I CAN REMEMBER
Line_4791	THAT IT ENDED UP BEING A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4792	IT SHOWES HOW MUCH MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE I GUESS
Line_4793	A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_4794	YOU MEASURE WA WELL YOU MEASURE MILLILITERS IN
Line_4795	I'M NOT SHUR
Line_4796	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT
Line_4797	JUST BY LOOKING AI AND FIGGERING OUT
Line_4798	YOU COULD JUST RIGHT THAT ABE SE D ON A CUP AND AN ACTUALLY AM NOT SHIRE
Line_4799	THAT THE FIRST CUP THE FIRST CUP IS BIGGER HAS MORE WATER THAN THE SECUENT CUP
Line_4800	THAT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU HAVE
Line_4801	JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUID
Line_4802	UM IT
Line_4803	UM I THINK IT KEEPS FUL
Line_4804	THEY WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT LIKE KINDS OF VOLUM MEASURE MAN
Line_4805	THAT IT'S FATTER BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME MASS OF VOLEUM OR YEAH VOLAM
Line_4806	THAT IF IT'S HOT OR COLD BECAUSE YEAH IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_4807	WHICH ONE IS THE HOTIEST OR WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST OR ONE OF THOSE
Line_4808	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4809	YOU FEEL DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF SOLCIGH AND FAIR H SOLCIES AND FAIR HE
Line_4810	I THINK IT'S A THERMOMETER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME BUT I THINK
Line_4811	UM LIKE I RIP DOWN TWENTY
Line_4812	I THINK NOTHING REALLY THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY UM I DON'T REALLY NO AN THING
Line_4813	IT'S ABOUT HOT NOT COLD I THINK MIXTURE
Line_4814	GETTING THE ANSWER OF SIES
Line_4815	CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF TOLE YOU USE AND THE UNIT TEMPERATURE
Line_4816	THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THE SAME
Line_4817	IT TURNS INTO FARAN HEIGHT
Line_4818	THAT THE FIRST ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A HUNDRED SOCES AND THE SECKAND ONE IS FIFTY FIVE SOIES
Line_4819	THAT THE CIRCUIT ONE IS A LOT COLDER THAN THE FIRST ONE
Line_4820	THAT IT'S LIKE COUNTING BY TEN LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY
Line_4821	M THE THERMOMETER GOES DOWN I GUESS
Line_4822	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER MAYBE
Line_4823	THAT IT GOES FROM UM FROM IT'S FROM FIVE TO SIX TO NINE AND THEN TO THIRTTEEN
Line_4824	THERE WAS A HUNDRED MINTS OR HUNDRED MINTS IGUES
Line_4825	THE INFORMATION FROM THE THERE THAT WE ACTUALLY USED TO RIGHT ON
Line_4826	TEMPERATURE AND MINTS THAT IT IS FROM
Line_4827	THE TEMP THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN AND CHANGE TO DIGREES SOSIS
Line_4828	YOU COULD ESTIMATE OR STICK YOUR FINGER AN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4829	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER AND GUESS WELL YOU WELL JUST YEAH BY JUST BY LOOKING AT IT
Line_4830	IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE THERMOMETER OR THE NUMBER LINE
Line_4831	THAT IT TURNS COLD TO IT TURNS PRITY COLD AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE GREES SOCYISE
Line_4832	THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE YEAH
Line_4833	BUT THIS THERMOMETER TELLS YOU UM A TEMPERATURE CHANGED
Line_4834	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER
Line_4835	THAT IT'S DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND EACH ONE
Line_4836	UM THE WATER IS GETTING HOTTER AND COLDER
Line_4837	S READDLY
Line_4838	UM DOING AROSE AND MY MATH
Line_4839	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4840	THE VOLEUM OR HOW LONG OR IT IS
Line_4841	IT'S HOW UM LONG IT IS FROM LIKE THE FRUNT TO THE BACK
Line_4842	IT TELLS ME HOW UM MONGMETER IS A CROSS
Line_4843	OF THE THE LENGTH OF THE DISC
Line_4844	I WAS THE STRAW AND THE MEASURING TAPER
Line_4845	MEASURING HOW UM LONG UM
Line_4846	SOME WEARE SMALLER AND SOME WERE LARGER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND UM
Line_4847	I DON'T KNOW ANY THING ABOUT IT
Line_4848	SO CH SOME ARE SHORTER AND UM GROUP IS IS UM LONGER THAN GROUP B BECAUSE UM
Line_4849	IT MEANS THAT IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT THEN WHAT YOU THINK
Line_4850	THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME AND AND EACH GROUP
Line_4851	UM YOU'RE SOPOSED TO USE UM THE SAME THING THAT ON EACH GROUP
Line_4852	I UM GOT SOME WATER INSIDE THE RANGE AND THEN I UM PUSHED IT OUT INTO THE CUP
Line_4853	UP CON SE A THREE
Line_4854	THE CAPACITY IS UM A HUNDRED
Line_4855	THERE IS A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4856	THEY ALL MEASURE UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4857	IT'S TWO MELLMITERS HO WATER
Line_4858	THEY'RE BOTH DUS THEY'RE BOTH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_4859	THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH THE UM THE CUP CAN HOLD
Line_4860	IT'S HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL
Line_4861	WEE UM MEASURED
Line_4862	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE ALITLES AND CAPACITY
Line_4863	IT SAD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_4864	IT'S UM THREE HUNDRED METERS VOLUTEM OPETY D
Line_4865	IT ELSE THREE HUNDRED WEIGH THIRTTY WE MALELY ER
Line_4866	THEY'RE BOTH VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT
Line_4867	SO LIGHT BULB WITH UM TEN MILLILITERS BY UM EACH FOR EACH SINE
Line_4868	I WOULD USE THE CAPACITY IN MILLILITERS
Line_4869	I DON'T KNON'T I DON'T KNON'T I DON'T I DON'T
Line_4870	I UM WENT
Line_4871	B WAS COLDIST A WAS UM A LITTLE MARMER AND SEE WAS A MESS
Line_4872	W UM CUP IS HOTTEST AND CH CUP IS COLDEST
Line_4873	UM A IS THE SAME AS SEE AND UM B IS ERGREEM SOUTH TE ES
Line_4874	IT'S HOW HOT OR CLOUD SOME
Line_4875	IT'S A FIOMETER AND UM IT CAN UM STEEL HOW UM HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4876	UM MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD SOM LIQUIDS ARE
Line_4877	THE THERMOMETER IS MORE ACURET
Line_4878	YET'S THE GREES SOLTH IS
Line_4879	ELL S US REM FAR AN HIGHT
Line_4880	THE MIDDALE OF FIFTY DGREES CLUES IS TEN AND TEN DIGREES CLUES IS THIRTY DIGREES LIES
Line_4881	OOD
Line_4882	IT UM IT DROPS THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4883	I SAW THAT IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER THAN UM EVERY MINUT IT WAS UM MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_4884	IT HAPEND EVERY ONE MINIT
Line_4885	IT WAS UM TWENTY DIGREES TO FIVE DIGREIEES
Line_4886	IT JUST STAYED ON THE ESE BUT IT NEVER WENT UP
Line_4887	THE TEMPERATURE AND UM THE TIME A MINTS
Line_4888	UM THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4889	IT'S GETTING MUCH BIGGER
Line_4890	IT DROPD UM FIFTEEN DIGREES
Line_4891	COLTING THE BOTTLE AND THIS ON THE WA
Line_4892	WELL IT'S PRITY EASY TO GET WATER THE CUP S YOU HAVE TO DO WITH POR
Line_4893	WELL IT GOES TEN L MILLILITERS TWENTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLILILITERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4894	WELL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS TOOL BUT MY GUESS IS TO
Line_4895	GOING UP TO THRUM BY FILL ING IT TO THIRTY N
Line_4896	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I NO IT MARNEY
Line_4897	UM MARNEY UM SAY TO YOU I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS I DO I NEED TO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4898	I THEY WANT TO GO MARNE CAMSRILOM GA BYE
Line_4899	IT'S HOW MUCH A WATER A CUP OR SOMETHING CAN HOLD
Line_4900	THAT THERE IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS FOR THE CAPACITY
Line_4901	M MARNEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_4902	UM SO ARE YOU ASKING WHAT DID I DO WELL WHAT HOLD MY CROP TO OR WHAT TO DO
Line_4903	THAT TOOLS HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE CAN IS UM YEAH
Line_4904	UM WELL
Line_4905	MEA HA MARNEY I HAVE TO GO NO CA
Line_4906	AND SO AFTER WE STUCK OUR FINGERS IN THE AND THE WATER OF THE CUPS WEE
Line_4907	WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS
Line_4908	I NOW AM LIKE HOW HOT OR HOW COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4909	WE PUT IN THERMOMETERS UM SO WE PUT IN THE THERMOMETERS AND
Line_4910	I CAN'T TELL WHAT THAT THE WON'T BE IS BUT
Line_4911	UM THAT SEE MEANS SALCIES
Line_4912	WELL UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4913	WELL I DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIES REALLY MEANS EX WE JUST GO TO START OR TEMPERATURE UNIT SO
Line_4914	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARNEY
Line_4915	UM SAMPONE
Line_4916	LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE TO SAY FIVE DIGREES THERE BUT YOU LOOK AT THE RED STUFF THAT GOES UP
Line_4917	UM WELL THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE RIGHT ARE HIER THEN THE ONES ON THE LEFT
Line_4918	WELL DOING RIGHT YOU COULD SEE AM GOOD
Line_4919	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURE
Line_4920	THE ISE MADE THE WATER COLDER
Line_4921	IN SO WE PUT THE ICE CUBS IN THAT MADE THE WATER MUCH MORE COLDER THAN IT WAS
Line_4922	FOR GO FIVE DIGREESE SOCIS
Line_4923	UM SO THEY CAN GET SUPERCOLED AND TURN TO ICICLU
Line_4924	UM AND SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL TEMPERATURE VERY WELL
Line_4925	AND SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN MAYBE A PANE PENSAL AND THEN YOU CAN RIGHT THE RESULTS ON THE PAPER
Line_4926	FOR THAT'S WHAT WE DID MARNEY UM
Line_4927	I WE DIDN'T REALLY DRAW OUR BUT WE ROT OUR DE
Line_4928	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ABOUT GRAFS MARNEY
Line_4929	WE PUT LIKE UM
Line_4930	THE IS A MINTTHAT IT TOOK EVERY TIME WE MEASURE
Line_4931	IT'S BECAUSE THEY MEASURED IT LIVE TIMES AND THEN THE TEMPER C TEMPERATURE CUP CHANGING A LITTLE
Line_4932	I DON'T REALLY NO MARNE
Line_4933	WE OBSERVED CHANGES MAYBE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTE
Line_4934	I DON'T I MEAN I DON'T KNOWTICE A LOT LOT MY
Line_4935	WELL I CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT I ROT TO MARNEY
Line_4936	I THINK IT WAS LIKE MAYBE TWENTY DIGREES SO A SUN
Line_4937	MARNEY ME CIRCUIT BYE NO BYE BYE
Line_4938	ELL MY IT'S CON JE WHAT'S YOUR SCROUP TO TH
Line_4939	YES THROUGH THE PER AND BELOW A HEAD
Line_4940	UM ONCE IS ON
Line_4941	THE YOU NOT I SELF
Line_4942	YES I DO GET THAT
Line_4943	UM WELL WE JUST STORED IN THO UNIT ABOUT MEASURING THE METRIC CISTUM AND WE FOR THAT WE WERE DOING METRY
Line_4944	I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LENGTH IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4945	THEY WERE A DIFFERENT SIZE SIZES SHOW EVERYONE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_4946	I UM MMM I'M NOT EXACTLY SO WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_4947	I AM GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU FIVE SKIN
Line_4948	UM THE FLOOR UP TO D
Line_4949	THEY ARE ALL THE METRIC THEY'RE ALL UNET TO THE METRIC SISTOM
Line_4950	EVERYTHING PROCICE IS THE UNIGHTED STATS USES THE METRIC SISTUM TO MEASURE STUFF
Line_4951	UM I DO NOT KNOW WHIE
Line_4952	WHAT YOU COULD ESTIMATE ESTIMATE WHATCH IS BASICLY LIKE MAKE OUR VRIALLY SMALL GUESS
Line_4953	UM IT'S TEN INCHES
Line_4954	SOLTY END SOTY INCHES WIDE AND TWENTY INCHES UM TALL
Line_4955	THRY INSESS
Line_4956	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4957	UM TO MIX WELL THEY GOT THE LIGHT ANSERL
Line_4958	I WHATEVER YOU'RE PATH TO IN DOWN
Line_4959	BECAUSE YOU COULD'VE BEEN DOING OVER AND OVER AND OMEFORGETN SO YOU HAVE BEEN BETTER EACH TIME
Line_4960	M SO OU I'M IT'S ACTUALLY SOL
Line_4961	GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU ASKING
Line_4962	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4963	THAT IS THAT IS A QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_4964	MAY WEOU MEASURED IT MORE THAN ONCE PAUSE UM IT WELL MAKE SHALL THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSUAL
Line_4965	YOU'RE PINK THE PINK THE BOTH AS PINKIE IS ONE SCENT METAL
Line_4966	IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_4967	YES I DON'T KNOW
Line_4968	IVETY NOSHO
Line_4969	M THE THEY ALL BOTH THE THING LIKES
Line_4970	HEY AVER UM MOST THE SAME LIONS
Line_4971	UM SOMER IN THEM ARE THE SAME AN
Line_4972	TIMED WAS
Line_4973	THEY HAS CIIMEEOWS ON THEM
Line_4974	I TO MAT NOW
Line_4975	I RAN BED THANK YOU
Line_4976	SO AND THEN THE IT ONE GOT CLOSED AROUND CLOSED TO THE SAME ANSL AROUND THE SAME NUMB
Line_4977	BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_4978	WHAT THEY'RE ARE MADE OF MOE
Line_4979	THI SE HOW WITCH ONES HEAVIER
Line_4980	I DON'T RALLE N
Line_4981	YOU TRID TO SEE HOW MANY POPER CLIPS THE PLASTIC IS
Line_4982	YOU YOU ARE USING UM H
Line_4983	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_4984	THEY WOULD TEACH CHI IS UM D M ON'TKNO
Line_4985	UM WE USED PROPEL CLEPT AND GRAMS
Line_4986	ANE ONE IS BIGGER THAN THE
Line_4987	THEY WOULD BE DIFFERENT
Line_4988	EVERYONE DID GET A DIFFERENT RESULT
Line_4989	UM I I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR SAING
Line_4990	ITS LENGTH A CUB AND IT SAIN IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_4991	I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW
Line_4992	BYE TO BYE-BYE
Line_4993	ELECTRIC CISTOM UNETS
Line_4994	UM YOU MEASURING WHAT THE THING WILL BUBBLE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHVE
Line_4995	MEASURING SOMETHING DOESN'T
Line_4996	THAT WEIGHS ANSWER A IT GRAMS SO YOU POLLUTE CALL KNO
Line_4997	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4998	SOLANGEH IS TWO HEAVY
Line_4999	NO

Line_5025	I DON'T ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5026	UM I CAN LUMBUAPE SO
Line_5027	M I FORGET WITH THOSE AND SO
Line_5028	WELL WE DI GOD OUT OF THE CUP WE SQOLED IT INTO THE CUP
Line_5029	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY METAL LQUOS AREN THERE
Line_5030	FIFTY MILL LITS
Line_5031	IT IT IT'S A HUNDRED MI LITELS IT'S VOLIUM IS ONE HUNDRED MIL LITELS
Line_5032	IT TELLS YOU IT'S BASILY LIKE THE CVANCE IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IS IN IT
Line_5033	UM YOUR MA OF STUFF UM YOUR LACIDVOLIUM OR STUFF U
Line_5034	UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THE WINGS ARE VAIN
Line_5035	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS

Line_5046	DI UBLI TO TOP
Line_5047	PLUBLUBLM THAT WA TELL IS BACKED IT'S IT LIKE THAT S L YOU COME TO BE
Line_5048	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN SIDE OF IT
Line_5049	THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MEANS NO ONE LITER IS IN SIDE THE SODA IS THE AMOUNT OF SODA IN SIDE
Line_5050	WHAT TE DO THING
Line_5051	UM THAT WAS JUST IT WAS TELLING YOU READ THE VOLIUM OF THE CAN
Line_5052	THREE HUNDRED THORTY U
Line_5053	UM NOTICE THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU FILL TO TOP
Line_5054	THEY THERE IS A SOLENT GRAGULAT A GRADUATED SIMANDL AND A LITTLE
Line_5055	UM YOU FORGET HOW MUCH IT'S HOW MUCH LIQUIDED AND SO SOMETIMES
Line_5056	WHAT'S JENRALE
Line_5057	UM ANT WIT'S
Line_5058	UM OUT WELL WHAT WE D YOU ONE NO
Line_5059	UM THEY ADD UP THE LAST FOR THEM IS TINED UP
Line_5060	UM OUT NO
Line_5061	HI MY NAME IS IKE AND I'M NINE
Line_5062	MEASURING IS ABOUT UM LIKE MEASURING AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT MEASURING IS ABOUT
Line_5063	I WOULD BE TRYING TO PICK OUT HOW LONG THAT IS THE THING YOU ASK ME TO MEASURE IS
Line_5064	I USED A STRAW AND THEN I USED UM MEASURING TAPE WITH UM CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5065	YOU GOT UH MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWER SO IT WOULD BE REALLY BADD UM STRATEGY TO USE JRAWS
Line_5066	HOW ARE YOU I'M VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_5067	M WE'VE BEEN DOING MOST ELACATION THAN DIVISION
Line_5068	UM YOU MEASURE STUFF WITH METERS AND THAT'S BACICALLY ALL OF IT LIKE YOU JUST MEASURE STUFF
Line_5069	UM BECAUSE IF YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET A MUCH MORE ACURAND ANSWER
Line_5070	UM MY THE HEIGHT OF MY DESC
Line_5071	UM FROM THE GROWM TO THE DING UP
Line_5072	THEY ALL HAVE CENTIMETERS IN IT
Line_5073	UM BECAUSE LIKE AND LIKE I FORGET
Line_5074	YOU WOULD ESTIMATE BECAUSE YOU WOULD ESTIMATE
Line_5075	UM ESTIMATING IS AN EDUCATED GUESS
Line_5076	IT IS THREE UNITS
Line_5077	I FORGET
Line_5078	OU CAN KEEP PRACTICING AND THEN YOUR ESTIMATES WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER
Line_5079	YOU WOULD GET BETTER BECAUSE YOU WOULD JUST KEEP ACT SAYING AND YOU WOULD GET THE MORE USE TO IT
Line_5080	YOU USE ROLAR OR A METER STICK OR LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_5081	YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS
Line_5082	LIKE IT WOULD JUST GO THAT IT WOULD BE VERY RINALLY SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY IT QUIGHT PROSICE ANSWER
Line_5083	TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT
Line_5084	OH I FORGET TI THING
Line_5085	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5086	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT
Line_5087	THE PERSON IS MEASURING A IS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5088	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5089	UM I T I FAR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5090	Y MEASURED FROM MY RESS TO MY ELBOW
Line_5091	THE MY AROM SPAN AND MY HEIGHT
Line_5092	I SEE THAT HER NOS N HER ERE ARE THE SAME LENGTH
Line_5093	AND JENNERAL USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH
Line_5094	YOU WOLD YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5095	OU USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5096	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5097	THAT THE BIGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETER IS ON IT IS A METER AND THEN IT GOES TO A DECIMETER AND THEN A CENTIMETER AND THEN A METER MILLA METER
Line_5098	YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER
Line_5099	I DON'T NOT KNOW
Line_5100	YOU AND ME AN O
Line_5101	I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_5102	IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT AN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN THEIR MATERIALS
Line_5103	IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5104	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5105	I FAR GET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5106	YOU I DON'T KNOW I THINK
Line_5107	FERN I DON'T KNOW
Line_5108	UM YOU ARE USING A STEEL TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5109	BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACIURET ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_5110	I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM
Line_5111	WE USED PAPER CLIPS
Line_5112	THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACT TO FIR UP THE REAL ANSWER
Line_5113	THAT PMIXTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUP THAT IS ONE GRAM
Line_5114	YOU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THINGS
Line_5115	UM IT WAS ONE GRAM
Line_5116	IT WAS A GRAM THE LITTLE THE METAL DISC WAS A GRAMS
Line_5117	THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5118	IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5119	GRAMS ARE THE UM MAURIC CISTUM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK
Line_5120	YOU CAN I NOW
Line_5121	YOU UM SO YOU HI CAN TELL ANY Y I TEND TO SET IT UP
Line_5122	SO UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5123	IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISC IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5124	THE CARE IN THE PIXTURE WEIGHES SEVEN D GRAMS
Line_5125	YOU COULDAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE IT'S NOT ENUFF GRAM PIECES
Line_5126	I PICKED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5127	A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOMETHING IS LESS THAN A GRAM
Line_5128	ONE MMM THOUSAND
Line_5129	I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUSE AND ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5130	YO WOULD USE IT WHEN THERE S THEAKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MOR THAN ONE THOUSAND
Line_5131	YOU WOULD GET ER REALLY ACQUURAIT UM ANSWER
Line_5132	I NOW THAT IF YOU PUT IT A DRY SPUNGE AND WATER THAT IT WILL EOBSORVE AND GET MUCH BIGGER
Line_5133	UH SOK SPUNGE UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5134	THE SPUNGE IN THE MITAL IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SO SPONGED
Line_5135	IT'S WHEN IT STOPS OBSORVING WATER
Line_5136	WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE ON A SPUNGE YOU CAN PUT THE SPUNGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_5137	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE
Line_5138	I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUAL THREE GRAMS
Line_5139	YO UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD CO M YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITH OUT THE SPUNGE IN IT
Line_5140	I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND I WITH THAT IT WAS TO A
Line_5141	I PICKURED OUT THAT THE WET VENE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5142	UM THE I OBSERVED THAT THE SPUNGE THE DRY SPUNGE SOKED UP UM THIRTTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5143	WE WERE TRYING TO FIR OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED
Line_5144	Y FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5145	YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MAD RE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
Line_5146	YOU USE GRAMS
Line_5147	YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD YOU TAKE A
Line_5148	IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS
Line_5149	YOU CAN USE A FIL
Line_5150	I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST FILE IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECAND FIRE
Line_5151	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE METRIC UNITS ARE FOR MEASURING VOLUTE
Line_5152	IT'S LEIATER
Line_5153	UH LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AND TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5154	MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER
Line_5155	I NOTICE THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE ONE HUNDRED MILL LITERS ON THEM
Line_5156	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND A LITER
Line_5157	R ONE HAH END ONE THOUSAND MILL LITERS AND A LITER
Line_5158	TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LITER
Line_5159	THE PLASTIC CUP
Line_5160	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5161	UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5162	IT'S A CEIRENT WITH UM WATER IN IT
Line_5163	IT MAKES UM GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN STUCK UP A PER FARY PERSIZE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5164	UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY RAPROEN
Line_5165	WE PICKED OUT THE VOLIUM BY USING A CEIRENT AND A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5166	THAT OBJECT IS A SIRANGE AND IT HAS FORTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5167	WHALE IS A GRADUATED SIMLANDER
Line_5168	NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5169	YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER B YEAH
Line_5170	TEMPACITY IS THE AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIP TOP LIKE YEAH
Line_5171	I NOTICE THAT UM AT THE CUPS CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT
Line_5172	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5173	IT'S WHEN U IT CAN HOLD ANY MORE WATER
Line_5174	THEY ARE ALL TWO HUNDRED MAILL LITER VESSLS
Line_5175	THEY DON'T KNOW
Line_5176	I OBSERVE THAT THE TALL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5177	I LEARN THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5178	UM WELL
Line_5179	IN MATH WEE SO WEE TRIDED TO SEE IF
Line_5180	I OBSERVED THAT IT'S THAT IT'S CAMPACITY AND IT'S CAMPACITY IT'S THREE HUN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5181	YOU COULD USE WATER TO HELP TO GET IT THE CAMPACITY OF THE TAN
Line_5182	I NOTICE THAT THE LIQUID IS AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5183	THE PRINTED NUMBER TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN
Line_5184	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5185	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5186	THAT IS THE CAMPACITY OF THE SODA CAM
Line_5187	IT STANDS FOR THE CAMPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5188	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5189	I OBSERVED THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA TAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS
Line_5190	THERE IS A CRANE UH GRADUATED ILUNDER AND UH LITER UH LITER LIKE CUP THING
Line_5191	YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH UM LIQUID IS IN SOMETHING
Line_5192	WE USE THE MATRIC CISTUM USES MILLILITERS AND MAN AND SCHOEL WEE ONLY USED MILLILITERS
Line_5193	YOU YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED
Line_5194	IT'S DOING A MATH OF QUASAN TO GET YOU TO YOUR ANSWER
Line_5195	SO THAT YOU CAN NO UM GOD THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5196	I DIS OUT VERY THAT IT WAS I HE DODN'T REALLY DISCOVER ANYTHING
Line_5197	YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF C CAP THE ER CAP WATER WAS WARMER
Line_5198	YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER
Line_5199	I THINK IT IS TRYING TO FIGGER OUT UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS CLOLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS AND BETWEEN
Line_5200	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5201	I THINK ABOUT IS HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
Line_5202	WE PUT THE MER AND
Line_5203	YOU USE THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5204	IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH
Line_5205	UM SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DIGREESE
Line_5206	YE YO WE'RE USING SALCIES AND THIS UNIT
Line_5207	IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOWN AND WHEN IT GOES DOWN
Line_5208	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5209	DO MU KNOW THAT
Line_5210	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5211	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_5212	WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER
Line_5213	WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE AND THE WATER
Line_5214	UM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY
Line_5215	UM WEE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT RENT IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH
Line_5216	I DISCOVERED THAT MUCH COLDER
Line_5217	IT DROPS LOWER
Line_5218	IT DROPD FIFTEEN SOLCIIS
Line_5219	THEY CAN FREESE
Line_5220	IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S A HUN LIKE CONTRACTING AND SO YEAH
Line_5221	YOU CAN RIGHT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND IT
Line_5222	WE JUST SPLADED IT BY RIGHTING IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5223	I UM MY AND NUMBERS ON A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
Line_5224	I NOTICE THAT IN TEN MINTS IT DROPTD DOWN THE FIVE DIGREES AND THENAND
Line_5225	THE PARTS OF THE GRAFT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_5226	GRASS ARE TO HELP YOU UM LIKE MEASURE AND KEEP TRACT OR STUFF
Line_5227	OU PUT NUMBERARS ON THE SIDE
Line_5228	IT HELPS YOU CEEP TRACT OF LIKE TEN MINTS IT'S FIVE DIGREES TWENTY MINUTS IT'S THREE DEGREES LIKE THAT
Line_5229	YOU CAN USE IT TO YEAH I DON'T AT KNOW
Line_5230	I PUT LIKE HOW IT DRUD HOW HOW IT DROPED IN TEMPERATURE AND HOW IT RUNS UP IN TEMPERATURE
Line_5231	THEY HELP YOU THEY ARE LIKE ABOUT
Line_5232	IT ONE THOWN REALLY FAR AND BUN ITS GOING UP
Line_5233	IT HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW HOW IT RISES AND TIME AND THE HOW IT DROPS IN TIME
Line_5234	OR TEN MINUETS
Line_5235	IT GOES UP AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5236	IT'S IT IS COLDER AND WATER WAY
Line_5237	DO NOT NEW THAT QUESTION
Line_5238	AND THEN YOU WOULD THEM TOGETHER AND GET YOUR ANSWER OF HOW M DIFFERENTE IT WAS
Line_5239	YOU CAN COUNT THE GRAM CLCIES IT DROPS
Line_5240	IT WHEN IT ER GOES DOOWN UM THE RED STUFF GOES DOWN ON A M THERMOMETER ER UP
Line_5241	UM THE TEMPERATURE IS CHANGING
Line_5242	I MY NAME IS SO
Line_5243	YES I DO
Line_5244	I I PRESSED THE REHETE BUTN
Line_5245	YES IT DUS
Line_5246	UM MEASURING IS WHEN WELL
Line_5247	MEASURING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE HOW LONG SOMETHING IS OR
Line_5248	I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGER OUT HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_5249	MINE IS A
Line_5250	ARNY I HAVE TO GO THE BIBE
Line_5251	ONE IS LONGER THAN THE OTHER BUT I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW
Line_5252	IN MATH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND WEE ARE DOING A LOT OF ANY STUFF AND MATH
Line_5253	UM IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR TO THE DOOR NUB
Line_5254	THEY'RE ALL FROM THE METRIC CICTUM
Line_5255	YOU CAN ESTIMATE
Line_5256	WELL SOMETIMES ESTIMATING AS JUST GUESS IT
Line_5257	YOU CAN WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5258	GUESSING HOW LONG WIDE OR THICK SOMETHING IS OR HOW TALL IT IS
Line_5259	ACTUALLY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5260	YOU CAN USE A MEASURED TAPE OR A RULER OR A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK OR FEET OR INCHES
Line_5261	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5262	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDER STE AND LESS QUACTON BUT
Line_5263	SO YOU CAN JUST DUBBL CHECK TO MIX SURE YOUR RIGHT
Line_5264	IT WAS A VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND EASY
Line_5265	AN A
Line_5266	WELL UM SOMETIMES IT'S HART SOMETIMES YOU NEAD A FRIEND TO HELP YOU BUT
Line_5267	FOR THAT I USED A MEASURING TAPE SO IT WAS EASIER THAN USING A METER STICK
Line_5268	THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG
Line_5269	E AS ONE CENTIMETER LONG SO IF YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS LIKE THREE CENTIMETERS ONE
Line_5270	YESTERDAY WE MEASURED WHICH ONE WAS THE HEAVEST WHICH ONE IS THE LIGHTEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5271	THE D UM THE METAL DISC IS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASSTIC DISC
Line_5272	PLASTICK SHOULD BE LIGHTER THAN METAL
Line_5273	YOU COULD MEASURE INSTEAD OF ESTIMATING
Line_5274	THE BALANCED AND MAYBE MY CUM
Line_5275	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5276	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5277	IT SAYS THAT SOMETHING EQUALS ONE GROUP
Line_5278	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5279	THAT THE THAT THE STUFF WE THE MATERIALS THAT WE USED WERE HEAVIER
Line_5280	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANY MEASUREMENT AND MASS
Line_5281	WE'VE BEEN THE EMETRIC CISTUM
Line_5282	THE LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD ON THE RIGHT CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5283	TEOLD ME THAT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5284	WELL IF YOU PUT LETS THEY
Line_5285	TWO GRAMS
Line_5286	YOU CAN ESTIMATE HOW TALL OR HOW MUCH THEY WAIGH
Line_5287	UH WHAT A REFERENCE IS YET
Line_5288	THEIR REFERENCES I'M GUESSING
Line_5289	TO BE MEASURED COMPLETELY STRAINGE
Line_5290	YOU NEAD SEVINTY GRAMS TO MEASURE THIS CAR TO MAKE IT COMPLETELY MEASURED
Line_5291	CAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENUFF SMALL GRAM PIECES AND IT WON'T MEASUREMENT STRLY
Line_5292	MAYBE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW HOW HOW HEAVY IT IS FOR A RECIPE OR SOMETHING IN A COKE BOOK
Line_5293	I HAVE NO I YEAH
Line_5294	GET A ONE HUNDRED GRAM PIECE OR USE A DIFFERENT THING THEN A BALANCE BEAM
Line_5295	TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5296	YOU ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_5297	THE GRAVEL IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAMS
Line_5298	SO THEY MEASURE EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5299	WE HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT KILOGRAMS YET
Line_5300	YOU USE IT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT'S TWO HEAVY TO USE FOR GRAMS
Line_5301	HEAVIER THAN HEAVIER THAN A BOOK
Line_5302	I HAVE TO GO GOOD BY MARNEY
Line_5303	IT'S GOING VERY WELL
Line_5304	WE HAVEN BEEN USING MUCH MEASUREMENT BUT WE'VE BEEN BEEN LANCING THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN USING A BALANCE
Line_5305	WELL IT'S DRY SO IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS A SPONGE WITH THAT WAS WET SO IT'S PRITY LIGHT
Line_5306	WHAT SPONGE IS A SPONGE WELL UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5307	WHEN IT I TO PULL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP
Line_5308	YOU PUT IT ON A BALANCE AND THEN YOU JUST KEEP ON PUTTING THE
Line_5309	THE THE DRY SPUNGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S LEVELED OUT ON THE BALANCE
Line_5310	THE WET SPUNGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPUNGE BECAUSE THE WO SSPUNGE HAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT
Line_5311	THE DRY SPUNGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5312	THE WIT SPONGE IS SIX TEEN GRAMS
Line_5313	UM THE THE WET SPUNGE IS
Line_5314	THE SPONGE HELPS THIRTTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5315	HEICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5316	ERY GOOD I AM VERY VERY GOOD
Line_5317	WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH AN EMTY CUP
Line_5318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5319	C THAT THAT THE CUP CAN HOLD THAT MANY VILES OF WATER AND SIDE OF IT
Line_5320	YOU COULD USE VILES
Line_5321	GROUP ONE IS BIGGER THAN GROUP TWO
Line_5322	IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND OTHER PEOPLE
Line_5323	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT AND CLUE SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5324	IT'S JUST MARKING THE SPOT
Line_5325	ERE IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS FILLED UP AND THAT
Line_5326	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLLITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5327	OW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN A CUP OR HOW MUCH USE OR SOMETHING
Line_5328	HERE IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5329	YOU COULD USE A CIRVANGE
Line_5330	IT SAYS LIKE EIGHT LITERS THIRTY EIGHT LITERS I MEAN MILLLITERS
Line_5331	UM WELL ACTUALLY YESTERDAY I WASN'T THERE FOR SIENCE SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5332	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T SHURE YESTERDAY AND SCIENCE
Line_5333	I DON'T KNOW HOW I PICK OUR AT OUT VALUE
Line_5334	WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY THING ABOUT A SILUNDER OR A CERVANCHE
Line_5335	I THINK IT'S CALLED A SERRANGE
Line_5336	I DIDN'T USE A SIRIANGE
Line_5337	I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A CIRANTE CAN HOLD
Line_5338	I DON'T KNOW I NEVER WORKED WITH THIS THE OTHER DAY SO
Line_5339	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT TLE
Line_5340	I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD DISCRIBE THAT
Line_5341	WE COULD MEASURE THE VOLTUM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_5342	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT I'M JUST GUESSING NOTHING
Line_5343	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5344	THAT'S TWO HARD I DON'T KNOW
Line_5345	ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
Line_5346	UM THE SECANDT CUP AS DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER AND IT AS THE FIRST CUP
Line_5347	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAMPACITY
Line_5348	THE SODA INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN ONLY FILLS UP TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_5349	YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA PAN AND IT SAYS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF SODA IS IN
Line_5350	YOU NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE TOP IT'S ONLY FILLED MOSTLY TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL THE WEIGHT
Line_5351	THE PRINTED NUMBER IS TELLING YOU THAT THE AMOUNT OF SODA THAT IS IN A TEN IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5352	THERE IS WELL THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF LIQUID INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5353	THE LIQUID OF THE VOLUM WAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5354	CAPACITY OF THE CAN IS THREE HUNDRED
Line_5355	I DON'T REALLY UNDER STAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT OR THE SAME
Line_5356	THERE IS A SPRANGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THING IN THE MIDDLE IS BUT THE UP IS ONE LITER
Line_5357	UM THERE IS NIN HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MAKES ONE LITER
Line_5358	I WOULD USE A SRINGE INSTEAD OF SOMETHING ELSE
Line_5359	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO THAT BUT MAR I'M GOING TO GO NOW BYE BYE
Line_5360	IT'S TRYING TO PICKER OUT WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDAL
Line_5361	UM ONE IS A FORML OR HOTTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5362	TO SEE HOW HOT COLD OR WARM SOMETHING IS
Line_5363	BECAUSE FINGERS DON'T WORK
Line_5364	IT MEASURES THE WEIGHT OR TEMPERATURE OR LENGTH OF SOMETHING
Line_5365	I THINK THE UNITS CALLED SOCIES
Line_5366	I DON'T KNOW THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MAYBE YOU LATER I WILL
Line_5367	THAT IT'S NOT AS COLD HOT I MEAN
Line_5368	HOT WATER IS WARMER THAN ICE A BECAUSE ICE IS IN THE WATER
Line_5369	FORGET SO ON THIS PIXTURE YOORE POR AND
Line_5370	WELL YOU'RE PORING I SWATER AND TO WARM WATER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
Line_5371	IT WOULD GET WARM AND COLD THE ICE WATER WOULD MAKE THE ARM WATER COLDER BUT THE ARM WATER WOULD MAKE THE ICE WATER WARMER
Line_5372	YOU COULD ESTIMATE
Line_5373	WELL I NEVER FIRED THAT OUT
Line_5374	IT'S GOING VERY GOOD
Line_5375	IT GETS A HOLDER
Line_5376	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER FAIR IN HEIGHT OR SOCIS
Line_5377	WELL WHEN I GET IT I USED A THERMOMETER
Line_5378	TWLITTLE SQUARES IT'S GOT THE AREA AND THE
Line_5379	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YEAH
Line_5380	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5381	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THAT IS
Line_5382	IT'S GOING DOWN OR UP
Line_5383	SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES OR SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES
Line_5384	UM A CUPL OF MINUTS
Line_5385	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETERL OR YOUR FINGERS IN YOUR FINGERS ARE THE BEST UM WAY TWO BUT IT IS ONE WAY
Line_5386	TWO SOLCIES DOWN
Line_5387	WE LOOKED AT AND THEN WE REQUARDERED IT ON THE PAPER
Line_5388	YOU COULD READ THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE THE MARKS BECAUSE THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5389	JUST THE UM THE RED PART GOES DOWN OR UP BUT IF IT STAYS THEN IT'S NOT CHANGE IT
Line_5390	WHATEVER IS IN THE WATER THE MEARE MATERIALS ISE HOT WATER THAT MAKES IT CHANGED
Line_5391	STUDYING MAGNETISM AND PLAIN WITH MAGNETS
Line_5392	BECAUSE IN YOUR CLASRUM WE DID THIS EXACTIAME THING AND THAT HAPAND
Line_5393	WASHERS A D CELL AND RMETAL ROCK
Line_5394	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT WON'T LET THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO ALL ER
Line_5395	WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH CIRCUITS WITH BATTERIES WIRES AND MOTORS ARE LIGHTS AND UH SWITCH
Line_5396	I PUT THE STRAW IN UM PLACE BECAUSE I JUST THAT IT WAS A STRIP OF METAL
Line_5397	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5398	I ACTUALLY JUST REMEMBER THAT ALAMINIUM DOES STICK BECAUSE IT IS METAL JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
Line_5399	NO NOT EXACTLY IT JUST KEEPS T PEOPLE SAFE FROM THE ELECTRICUTING THEM SELES OR BEING SHOCKED OR GETTING HURT
Line_5400	BRASS HOLE I MEAN WASHER AND NOTHING ELSE
Line_5401	IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MAGNETS
Line_5402	WE'VE BEEN ELECTRICITY AND USING CIRCUITS AND THEN TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5403	THE BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHIND UP BUT IN OUR CLASS THAT WE CAN GET THEM TWO
Line_5404	IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF NEGATIVE AND GOING TO POSITIVE AND SO IT TRAVELS THROUGH AND SO YEAH
Line_5405	IT ALWAISE HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE AND NOT BUT NEGATIVE AND IT ALWAIS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SO YEAH
Line_5406	THE BATTERY US HAS TO FLOW BACK INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVES
Line_5407	LEARNING ABOUT THE WATER CYCLE
Line_5408	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5409	THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THROUGH THE PLANK OF WOOD
Line_5410	E HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_5411	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5412	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_5413	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP IN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AT BRIGHT
Line_5414	THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PATH N TWOTH TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
Line_5415	THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBIND
Line_5416	THE ELECTRICITY IS SWOLMING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5417	ONE IS A BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5418	I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE IS A NON PARALLEL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE
Line_5419	THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THE OT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5420	THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5421	THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5422	A D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER
Line_5423	WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5424	THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOUR SELF
Line_5425	POSIITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5426	WITCH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND S ON THE NEGATIVE
Line_5427	THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GITTING ENUFF ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIRE IS ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO IT DOES NOT LIGHTING UP
Line_5428	I HAVE TO ATACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_5429	IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT
Line_5430	THE CAN THE UN BOAT
Line_5431	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_5432	A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_5433	ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL
Line_5434	WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
Line_5435	THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASSTICK
Line_5436	I I HAVE BEEN DARRING SING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS CAN STICK
Line_5437	UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU SLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH THEM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APPART
Line_5438	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO EOTHER EVEN THO IT'S UM IF BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
Line_5439	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
Line_5440	THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING OR
Line_5441	WELL THE MAGNET ARCH IS PUSING THEM TOGETHER AND THAT MAKES A STICK AND IF MA UN IT MOVES
Line_5442	MAGNETIC FOURCE IS MAKING THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5443	ICY GO THROUGH OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5444	THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5445	IRON IRON METAL OR STEEL
Line_5446	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE TO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5447	IT IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS FROM ONE BATTERY
Line_5448	WELL IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY IT WILL BETTER YOU
Line_5449	THAT ONE'S CAN A TUFF FOR ME
Line_5450	IT ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5451	WELL ON THE PIXTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE RIGHT AND ON THE PIXTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_5452	THAT'S CAN TUFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5453	THAT'S AN UFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5454	BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5455	UH THAT'S GONNA A TAP ONE FOR ME
Line_5456	ELL GRIPS OR A NEGATIVE INTO THE POSITIVE AND AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
Line_5457	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
Line_5458	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNEY
Line_5459	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU RAIN ABOUT THAT MARNEY
Line_5460	THAT THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUND THE RIVET
Line_5461	THAT THERE IS ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONE SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5462	WELL PART OF ITS WRONG IT DOESN'T
Line_5463	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH
Line_5464	THE ELECTRO MAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
Line_5465	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5466	T ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_5467	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_5468	WELL THE FOULL E ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO CIND OF CONNECT TWO
Line_5469	THE RIVET CAN STAY MAGNETIC UH FOR RIGHT SOME TIME
Line_5470	WELL IN SCIENCE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5471	ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5472	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5473	IT'S A MAGNET THAT ATTRACTS IT'S UM OPOSIT AND DOES NOT ATTRACT IT'S UM THINGS
Line_5474	IT ATTRACTS THEN WELL
Line_5475	IT'S ATTRACTING THINGS THAT ARE STEEL OR IRON
Line_5476	UM IT DOESN'T DO ANY IT DOESN'T STICK TO ANY MATERIALS THAT AREN'T UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_5477	UM THERE IS IRON OR STEEL THERE IS SOM NOCK WOOD PLASTIC COPPER AND A SPONGE
Line_5478	UM WELL THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE UM SO UM MOSTALLY METAL AND YEAH
Line_5479	I THINK THAT IRON AND STEEL IS THE ROCK SO IT MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE CONTAINING IN THAT ROW
Line_5480	YOU ASCME THAT BUT UM IT IT STICKS TO IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY
Line_5481	UM MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL AND
Line_5482	UM THE STHE STEEL NAIL UM STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMIN NAIL DOES NOT
Line_5483	AND ALUMINIUM MAIL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT HAS SOPOSE TO GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_5484	UM THE ALUMINUM NAIL UM DOES NOT HAVE THE MATERIAL IN IT THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL DOES
Line_5485	ONE I THINK THAT UM THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TOGETHER ARE AN OPOSIT SIDES AND THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER ARE
Line_5486	ORKING ON MAGNETS AND WATER
Line_5487	UM THERE IS ENUFF WASHERS AND THE ONE SIDE THAT IT OVER POWERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_5488	UM THE THE UM WASHERS H R THERE IS ENOFF WASHERS SO IT OVER POWERS THE MAGNET
Line_5489	UM THEY THEY STILL ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT
Line_5490	BLOCKS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5491	HERE'S STILL A BIT OF MAGNETIC FIELD THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS STRONG AS IT WAS WHEN IT ONLY HAD LIKE A CUP OF SPACERS
Line_5492	UM IT'S CALLED MAGNETIC FIELDS AND IT T OPSOPSITS ATTRACT AND UM THE SAME D CRAP D TRACS
Line_5493	UM YOU OR T ASS FROM THAT QUESTION
Line_5494	TWO BULBS AND HAVE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH TWO CIRCUITS
Line_5495	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BRIGHTER AND THE ONE ON THE LESS IS A BRIGHTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FORMATION
Line_5496	IT'S A DIVER
Line_5497	UM IT'S BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH THE MOTHER E ELECTRIC A BULB
Line_5498	UM THERE IS THE ELECTRA THEY'RE THE SILL FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH THINGS
Line_5499	IT'S TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULBS
Line_5500	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH BULB
Line_5501	IT GOES THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND IT JUST KEEPS TRAVELING A CIRCUIT FOR EACH SIDE
Line_5502	IF ON THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S EACH BULB HAS A SEPARET THING
Line_5503	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH AND IS GOING THROUGH IT SEPARIT PATHWAY
Line_5504	PROBABLY PARALLEL
Line_5505	LECTRICITY IS RESEMBLED BY BLUE TRAVELING DOTS
Line_5506	UM I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5507	UM DO YOU MEAN STRING OF CRISCMESCE LAS
Line_5508	UM THERE IS WASHERS THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY THERE IS A WIRE A SWITCH A HOLDER AND THE STEEL ROD
Line_5509	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TO IN IT ATTRACTS THINGS IF IT'S A MAGNET
Line_5510	UM IT'S AN ELECTRO MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STROWS
Line_5511	THE WIRES WRAPPED ABOUND
Line_5512	UM THE ELECTRO MAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5513	IT'S BASICALLY TURNING ON THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5514	IT PICKS UP THE WA THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5515	IT'S CLOSED
Line_5516	UM THE SWITCH WHEN WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST ACTOVATS THE ELECTRICITY AND PICKS UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5517	UM THE BATTERY IS MAKING ELECTRICITY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5518	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ALL THE WAY SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5519	IT'S THE IT IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WHICH PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5520	M WELL BASICALLY IS UN TOMLED A BATTERY UN RUNS OUT OR THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF
Line_5521	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL IN A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_5522	UM UH I SEEN PAPER CLIPS BE TEMPORMAR MAGNETS YEAH
Line_5523	SOULITER AH
Line_5524	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDING MAGNETISM AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER THAT REALLY
Line_5525	UM A BATTERY UM A LIGHT BULB SOME WIRE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A HOLDER I GUESS

Line_5568	IT HAS TWO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS SLUG THROUGH A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5569	THE MAGNET THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP
Line_5570	WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LUSE THEIR STRENGTH
Line_5571	THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS
Line_5572	WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM
Line_5573	IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THEN YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT
Line_5574	YOU NEED T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5575	YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FON EXPECTALLY THE ME ONES
Line_5576	THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5577	UM THERE ARE TWO
Line_5578	BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BERN BRIGHTER
Line_5579	THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD
Line_5580	TO DAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OWORS DIDN'T WORK
Line_5581	TO DY WE MADE ELECTROW MAGNETS BUT OWERS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A NE BATTERY
Line_5582	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS SORT OF SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_5583	ONE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND AN NOTHER IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5584	O IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_5585	UM IT HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5586	UM THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT
Line_5587	IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT THEN UM NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_5588	WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS A PROBABLY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE ONE I COLLECT ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONES DIDN'T BURN OUT
Line_5589	UM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH PREY MUCH CONNECTED TO THE UM D CELL
Line_5590	U PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF ONE BULB LIGHTS OUT BERNS OUT THEN THE OTHERS WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_5591	THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT AS WELL AS THE OTHERONE
Line_5592	UM IT'S ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5593	UM THEREWAS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT
Line_5594	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5595	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING AROUND OR ELSE THE ENERGY WON'T REACH THE MAGNET SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_5596	IF YOU TURN IT IF YOU CLOSE THE SWITCH THEN IT'S SORT OF TURNS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON SOR LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_5597	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT IN A SORT OF IN A CIRCLE OR ELSE THE IT WON'T FLOW CORRECTLY
Line_5598	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROW MAGNET
Line_5599	TEMPORARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG
Line_5600	ACTUALLY IT HAS TO
Line_5601	ONE IS CONNECTED UM NOT IN CORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_5602	IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5603	IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A RUT
Line_5604	IT'S THE ENERGY SOURCE THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WA IRON TO CREATE THE EL ELECTRICITY
Line_5605	I SEE A D CELL A LIGHT BULB A REALLY SMALL LIGHT BULB AND SOME WIRES
Line_5606	THOSE ARE THE WIRES WHITCH THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR STUREN
Line_5607	UM WELL IT CHARGES THINGS
Line_5608	UM THE ENERGY IT COMES IN FROM ONE END AND UM COMES OUT AND THE OTHER
Line_5609	IT IS UM
Line_5610	IT IS UM CHARGING THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR GOES AND THAT'S PRITY MUCH YET
Line_5611	IT SHOES THE UM THE SIMBULES
Line_5612	UM I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR
Line_5613	IF THEY WEAREN'T UM NEXT TO THE EM FOR THE MOTOR OR THE D CELL SIMPLES THEN IT WOULDN'T RUN
Line_5614	THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5615	WE JUST FINISCHED LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY AND CLASS AT A CUPL OF MINTS AGO
Line_5616	THEN THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH SO TO THE LIGHT BULB SO UM THE LIGHT BULB CAN NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5617	WE'VE BEEN STUDY AND A MAGNETISOM ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5618	WELL THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER UM MAGNETS ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_5619	UM GIVING EACH OTHER WAY THEY ARE REPELLING
Line_5620	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_5621	UM WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL IT
Line_5622	WELL IF IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE OTHER ONE WILL TURN OUT BUT T'S IF IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WON'T TURN OUT
Line_5623	THAT THE WIRES UM ARE LIKE REALLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_5624	IF THERE IS A NOTHER LIGHT BULB OR UM THEY ALL BRAND OUT
Line_5625	UH WELL UH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FASTER IN THE PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5626	WELL IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FAST IT'S FASTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5627	AS MORE ELECTRICITY A MORE POWER
Line_5628	ORE POWER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5629	BUT IT HAS MORE WIRES
Line_5630	ATHWAY AND FOR A PARALLEL IT'S TWO PATHWICHE WHICH IS GIVING IT MORE POWER
Line_5631	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5632	THEY'RE UM STUFF THAT ARE LIKE THAT USE ELECTRICITY
Line_5633	THAT IT'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5634	IT IT'S GIVING IT MORE POWER THE MAGNET MORE POWER
Line_5635	WHEN WIRES WRAPPED ABOUND A KIND OF A MAGNET
Line_5636	YES UH M
Line_5637	ONLY YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRICAL MAGNET
Line_5638	I HAVE TO GO MARNEY SEE YOUH
Line_5639	EVE BEEN STUDYAND ELECTRICITY
Line_5640	THEY'RE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY UH POWER TRAVELS TO WITH THEM
Line_5641	THEY HAS POWER SIDE IT
Line_5642	IT HAS A LOT OF ENERGY U
Line_5643	UM THE BATTERY IS UM ELECTRICITY IS RUNING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GIVING IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS SPINING
Line_5644	IT'S GOING IN CIRCLES AND IT'S GIVING POWER TO THE MOTOR
Line_5645	WELL THE MOTOR HAS I FOR GET TO BE RUNNING AND NEEDS ELECTRICITY
Line_5646	WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WAIRE EVERYTHING GOES LIKE IN CIRCLES
Line_5647	UM WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING SO IT'S CLOSED
Line_5648	UH UM M CERIES POWER
Line_5649	IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY RUN AND IT LETS THE MOTOR ER UM SPIN A RUN
Line_5650	UM CLOSED CIRCUITS UM GOING CIRCLES
Line_5651	IT'S OFF BECAUSE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GONG M GIVING IT POWER
Line_5652	I SEE AND EM AND UM SIMBLE
Line_5653	WHEN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB THERE NEEDS TO BE A NOTHER WIRE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WIRE IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5654	Y ARE MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_5655	THERE IS FLORY FLOWING THROUGH THEM
Line_5656	NECT THE WA YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UH WHERE THE OTHER WIRE IS HITTING
Line_5657	NEED ENERGY TO FLOW IN ORDER TO H
Line_5658	'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5659	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5660	Y SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY'RE SHARING THEY'RE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5661	TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK INSTEAD OF ONE LIGHT BULB WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5662	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AND COMING OUT THE SIDE
Line_5663	SURE MARNEY HAVE TO GALLOW
Line_5664	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETS
Line_5665	AND THE SAME SIDES ATTRACT
Line_5666	THEY'RE REPELLING
Line_5667	THEY ARE THEY'RE REPELLING BESO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5668	THEY HAVE SO MUCH FORCE SO THEY JUST THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_5669	THE MAGNET IS PUTTING A LOT OF FORCE AND THE NAIL SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5670	UM IT IS HANGING FROM THE IT THE PAPER CLIP IS HANDING HANGING FROM THE NAIL
Line_5671	WE'VE BEEN LIGHTING LIGHT BULBS AND POWERING MOTORS
Line_5672	PARALLEL CIRCUIT WHEN LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB BEURNS OUT THE OTHER M CEPS ON
Line_5673	WHEN A LIGHT BULB BEURNS OUT ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB STAISE
Line_5674	AND THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS UM UM ARE BRIGHTER
Line_5675	THERE ARE TWO W WAIGHST
Line_5676	GOING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE D CELL TO THE TUP
Line_5677	THIS SHOWS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5678	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5679	TWO LIGHT BULBS A BATTERY
Line_5680	IF ER IF IT BEURNS IT MEANS THAT IT'S TO THE BATTERY HAS TO MUCH
Line_5681	THE POWERS COMING FROM THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5682	IN ONE THE BATTERY IS ON THE MIDDAL AND THEN THE OTHER ONE THE BO THE THE BATTERY IS ON THE BOTTOM
Line_5683	IF I CLICK ON IT UM ONE TURNS ON THEN ONES IN SAL
Line_5684	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5685	IF THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTING TO BOTH THEM THE WIRE GOES OUT TO AND THEY BOTH THEY BOTH BERN
Line_5686	THERE'S A UM
Line_5687	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5688	THE ELECTRICITY'S TRAVELING TO THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5689	ERE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ON THE RIGHT AND SERIESS ON THE LEFT
Line_5690	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT NOT IN THE OTHERS DO
Line_5691	AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM UH
Line_5692	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE UM IT GOES BOTH WAYS AND ON A SERIES CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY ONLY TRAVELS ONE WAY
Line_5693	THERE IS TWO THERE IS TWO WEIGHS FOR AND THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY ONLY GOES ONE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_5695	IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY AND A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5696	THE ELECTRICITY IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT TRAVELS BOTH WAYS AND THE ELEANDTHE ELECTRICITY AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT TRAVELS ONLY ONE WAY
Line_5697	IF ONE BULB RUNS OUT THEN IT THE OTHER ONES WON'T PER OUT
Line_5698	A SERY I MEAN A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5699	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5700	PUTTING A PAPER CLIPER ON THE BOCX AND THEN IF IT STICK IF IT STICKS TO THE BOCX THAT MEANS THERE IS THE MAGNET
Line_5701	UH PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5702	WEELL IT WAS KIND OF HARD TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE MAGNET WAS
Line_5703	IT'S LIKE MOVING AROUND
Line_5704	THEY SEPARATE
Line_5705	THE PAPER CLIPS STARTED TO SPIN AROUND ONE IT CLOSER TO THE MAGNET
Line_5706	THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLE ARE CONNECTING
Line_5707	IT'S STICKING TO THE BOX
Line_5708	CEP LIKE STICKING ONES IT ONE WE GOT CLOSER IT CEPT PULLING IT SELF ALL THE WAY TO THE MAGNET
Line_5709	IT LIGHT AHM
Line_5710	STUCK TO THE BOCX AND THEN IT DIDN'T FALL OFF SO WE NO THERE WAS A MAGNET THERE
Line_5711	IT STARTED ATTRACTING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5712	MOST OF THE IRON FILINGS ARE UM LINED UP AND SOME OF THEM ARE LIGKHE ALL MEXED UP
Line_5713	IT HAS METAL AND IRON IN IT SO THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_5714	THE NOR CAPED UM MOVING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5715	C IS MADE FROM IRON SO IT MAKES IT STICK TO METAL
Line_5716	NOR THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT AND NORTH AND NORTH AND OR SOUTH AND SOUTH REPELE
Line_5717	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BATTERIES
Line_5718	THOSE ARE WIRES THAT CONNECTED A BATTERY TO MOVE ENDIN
Line_5719	WELL THE BATTERY IS
Line_5720	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH THEM
Line_5721	THEY BRING THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR WHICH POWERS THE MOTOR
Line_5722	IN THE CIRCUIT THE ENERGY IS TRAVELING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_5723	WITH CIRCUIT IT ON AND SOUNDS LIKE CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5724	IT KEEPS TURNING AROUND BECAUSE CIRCUIT IN ON LIKE CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5725	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_5726	UM IT'S GOING GREY A NO
Line_5727	IN SCIENCE RA NO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5728	UM SO THE THING WITH THE PLUSS IN THE MINE IS IS A BATTERY
Line_5729	UM THE THE RED THING IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5730	THE CREEN STUFF IS WIRES
Line_5731	D CELLS POWER UM OBJECTS
Line_5732	THE THE BATTERY PROVIDES AN ELECTRIC PATHWAY TO POWER A LIGHT BULB
Line_5733	IN SCIENCE I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND OTHER CIRCUIT
Line_5734	I THINK ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5735	THE CIRCUIT I SEE THERE IS A PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5736	THE LIGHT BULB IS FARING TO NO THE BATTERY IS FARING TO LIGHT BULBS AT THE SAME TIME AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5737	THE BULBE DOTS ARE CARRYING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULB AN POWERING IT
Line_5738	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IT'S COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF A BATTERY TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5739	I AM SEEING TO PATHWAYS
Line_5740	BECAUSE IT HAS TO PATHWAYS
Line_5741	WELL THE CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT HAS IS A PARALLEL PATHBY AND THE CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS A SERIES
Line_5742	UM NO
Line_5743	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
Line_5744	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_5745	WE'VE BEEN UM SEEING IF MAGNETS STICK ON STUFF
Line_5746	UH PAPER CLIPS AND UM
Line_5747	MAGNET STATIC STEEL OSALLY STEAL
Line_5748	WELL THE MAGNETS STICKING AND THEN THE MAGNET IT'S NOT STICKING TO THE TO THE SAME MAGNET FOR SOME REASON
Line_5749	THE MAGNET STUCK TO THE ONE BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES UM AN WELL
Line_5750	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE ONE BUT THEN THE OTHER WILL BE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU FLIP THE MAGNET OVER THEN ONE OF ITS SIDES WON'T STICK
Line_5751	WELL THE MAGNETS UM I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE
Line_5752	I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
Line_5753	CAN'T THINK OF ANY M
Line_5754	THE AS THE WARDS THAT UM YOU LIKE PUT STUFF ON IT LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON YOUR DESCK
Line_5755	UM YOU TRY TO YOU PUT UM WIRES ON IT AND A MOTOR AND YOU TRY TO FIR OUT WHERE THE UM WIRES ARE
Line_5756	THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTED UM TO D AND A
Line_5757	IT CONNECTS TO THESE UM I THINK THEY'RE BRASS THINGS OR THEY MIGHT BE STEEL
Line_5758	WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LITTLE GOLB THING ON TOP
Line_5759	IT'S WIRE INSIDE IS THE MISTERY BORD
Line_5760	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH FOR WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5761	WELL THE UM CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM UH I FORGOT WHAT A CIRCUIT WAS
Line_5762	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES THEN ITS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING BACK
Line_5763	THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY I THINK
Line_5764	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM ON THE UH D CELL I INK
Line_5765	THE UM LIGHT BULBS LIKE ARE BRIGHTER WHEN YOU WHEN THERE IS TWO BATTERIES BUT THEY'RE DIMMER WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE
Line_5766	IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHTER
Line_5767	UM I DON'T KNOW AND BYE
Line_5768	I WASN'T HER FOR SCIENCE TODAY SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5769	DON'T KNOW WHAT WE GET SO THAT WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE
Line_5770	UM I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANY THING BECAUSE I WAS NOT HER TO DAY
Line_5771	I CAN EXPLAIN T I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5772	MAGNETS ARE REALLY STICKING I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OF SPACERS
Line_5773	I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN OBSERVE ANY THING ELSE A
Line_5774	I DON'T I CAN FIGER THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_5775	WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5776	WELL UM THE UM THE D CELL BATTERY IS LIGHTING THE TWO UM UM LIGHT BULBS
Line_5777	THE ONE IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM BRIGHTER
Line_5778	THE BLAH IS THE UM ENERGY OR THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_5779	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUSS SIDE
Line_5780	TWO CIMBLES ON THE SIDE EQUAL LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE TWO CIMBLES IN THE MITTAL EQUAL A UM BATTERY
Line_5781	IT MEANS IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5782	IT'S GOING REAL LIKE H I MEAN PRAY GOD
Line_5783	I NOT WOULD I FORGOT WHAT I WAS DOING A SCIENCE
Line_5784	UM WELL IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE WEIGH I FORGOT SOARY
Line_5785	WELL IF YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE D CELL AND THEN YOU TOUCHED THE OTHER END OF THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5786	WELL THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF UM OH I FORGOT
Line_5787	THINK LIKE THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5788	ELL IF YOU PUT LIKE WIRES ON A CIRCUIT UM UH I FORGOT
Line_5789	UH A CIRCUIT CAN IF YOU ATTRACT WIRES TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BUL UM LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_5790	THE UM WIRES ARE TAKING POWER FROM THE UM D CELL PRITY MUCH AND THEN IT'S GIVING THE POWER TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5791	I THINK IT MIGHT BE LIKE ELECTRICITY BUT UM NOT SHURE
Line_5792	IT'S WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UM TO THE D CELL THEN YEAH
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH W ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB ANSO IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_5794	WELL ONE NEEDS TOUCH ON THE BOTTOM ONE NEEDS A TOUCH ON THE SIDE ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WON'T TURN ON
Line_5795	MORE OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5796	I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5797	WELL WE WERE LIKE DOING THE STING WEAR WE HAD TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_5798	WELL WE USED A WIR A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR AND A LITTLE PLAT FORM AND THEN A SWITCH
Line_5799	WELL THE D CELL CON IS LIKE THE IS THE ELECT TRICK SOURCE PRAY MUCH
Line_5800	HE D CELL IS THE SOURCE
Line_5801	IT PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY PRITY MUCH
Line_5802	WIRES CLAY WITH THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5803	I THINK IT'S LIKE IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY OR LIKE OR ELECTRICITY PRITY MUCH I THINK
Line_5804	WELL IT'S SPINNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE MOTOR
Line_5805	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE WIRE TING SO YEAH
Line_5806	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5807	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IS SPINNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_5808	WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE MOTOR
Line_5809	BOTUM IT'S PRITY IT'S A LIGHT BULB I MEAN UH D CELL BATTERY OR A BATTERY ON THE TOP IT'S A LIGHT BULB
Line_5810	WITCH I THINK I THINK IT WAS LIKE A SWITCH
Line_5811	THE ELECTRO THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS PICKING UP H HOLE ROM MAGNETS
Line_5812	IN LESS WRAPS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5813	IT CEPS STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5814	IT GETS MORE MAGNET IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5815	IT PICKS UP MORE UM WASHERS
Line_5816	WELL UM THE STRENGTH IS GETTING WELL UM IT GETS STRONGER
Line_5817	YOU CAN WRAP A WIRE ABOUND IT
Line_5818	CAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
Line_5819	UM THAT IT GETS STRONGER EVERY TIME THERE IS MORE WIRES
Line_5820	BE LIKE TWENTY UM NOT TO SHURE BUT
Line_5821	WELL I WENT TO WERE THE NINTY FIVE WOULD BE ON THE GRASS AND THEN I WENT OVER AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE ON FIFTEEN
Line_5822	THERS ARE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS I THINK
Line_5823	WELL SINCE THE PAPER CLIPS STEEL IT'S PRITY IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_5824	MOST OF THEM ARE MADE FROM STEEL SOME OF THEM ARE ALUMINIUM THE
Line_5825	STEEL AND ALUMINIUM
Line_5826	THEY'RE ALL NOT STEEL OUR ALUMINIUM
Line_5827	AND SOILITERS I LIKE UM SPONGES ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5828	IN CILLUMINATORS ORE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT STEEL
Line_5829	ELL LIST WELL STEEL UM CAN GET PICKED UP BY A MAGNET BY ALUMINIUM IT CAN
Line_5830	THEY'RE ALL STEEL
Line_5831	HI MARNEY MY NAME IS NAAOLLEN HOW ARE YOU DOING WE DO KNOW WHAT THE DAY IS
Line_5832	WE'VE BEEN TESTING MAGNETS ON DIFFERENT OBJECT TO SEE IF THEY STICK OR NOT
Line_5833	THEY UM THROUGH ALL ETHER STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CONTAINS IRON OR IRON
Line_5834	ONE NAIL IS NOT IRON OR STEEL
Line_5835	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO UM IRON OR STEEL UM ONE OF THEM ASNT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT DON'T STICK
Line_5836	THE MAGNETIC FORCE CAN INTO JENERATE AROUND LIKE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO STICK TO OTHER THINGS
Line_5837	EY CAN GO THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5838	ONE OF THE MAGNETS IS JENERATING MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE TABLE SO IT'S MAKING IT STICK
Line_5839	I'M MATCH HOW IT DOES IT BUT MAGNETS CAN JUST SOME HOW AN RIGHT MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE ANOTHER MAGNET STICK
Line_5840	UM UH THE STICK NESS REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S TWO THICK AND THEN MAGNETIC FORCE WON'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_5841	UM THAT ALL THE MAGNETIC DOMAINS INSIDE ARE ALL FASING THE SAME WAY AND IT'S PRTY MUCH AND TO TURNED AND IT'S PRITY MUCH TURNED INTO A MAGNET
Line_5842	UM THEN IT I DON'T J IT FILED AROUND IT TEN IT MADES THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5843	THE MAGNET HAD IT BEEN RABED TO CHARGE THE NAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO I DOT TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5844	BECAUSE THE MAGNET SHARCANNAIL PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT UM SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5845	OH A CIRCUIT IS A WAY FOR UM ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL AND IT MAKES SOME CIND OF CIRCLE FORM
Line_5846	UM ELECTRICITY TRAVEL A CIRCUIT IS THE WAY TO LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL
Line_5847	IT'S FORMING A CIRCLE
Line_5848	IT HAS TO GO FROM THEN MINES SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5849	ONE HAS MORE THINGS IN IT THE OTHER ONE GUESS IS A BASE LIKE A LIGHT BULB CIRCUIT
Line_5850	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ONE ON THE LATER IS JUST BASIC
Line_5851	IT'S GOING FROM THE MINE SIDE UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB DOWN AND THEN UP INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN DOWN AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY D IT CSAT KEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5852	IT SHOWS LIKE HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_5853	AND TWO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_5854	IT GOES AROUND INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UM OUT OF THE THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE BATTERY D THE CAS HE CIRCLING
Line_5855	I'VE ORADY SAD ENOUGH ABOUT FLOW
Line_5856	UM THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE BRINGS IT IN
Line_5857	NO MATTER WHITCH WAY YOU TURN IT THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS THE STRING TO PUT THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE PLUS SIDE IS ALWAISE DOING TO BRING IT IN
Line_5858	UM THE THE LA DOTS ARE STILL GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5859	THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM YOU SEE THE LITTLE BS COMING OUT OF
Line_5860	INSTITTING INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A WIRE IS JUST GOING INTO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEN OUT AGAIN
Line_5861	TWO BATTERIES HAS MORE POWER THAN ONE SO THE LIGHT BULBS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
Line_5862	I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME SO FIVE
Line_5863	THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THE MAGNETIC FORCE GOING THROUGH UM THE CUP SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5864	THE SHURELY BREAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE SO THE WEIGHT FROM THE WASHERS
Line_5865	IT'S MOVING THE BACK IT'S MOVING THE MAGNETS FARTHER APART
Line_5866	MAGNETIC FOR IT'S GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AT THE CUP SO IT CAN STICK BUT IT'S DCRENT BUT MAY MAGNETIC FORCIS DCREASING WHEN THE SPACERS ARE PUT BETWEEN THEM
Line_5867	YOU SHOULD ALIES EITHER HAVE LIKE A MAGNET MAGNETS TOGETHER AND WASHERS
Line_5868	MAYBE COULD SEE USE DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WERE IN A STRONG
Line_5869	WE WERE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY WE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT A A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANIMALS THAT USED ELECTRICITY TO FIND THE FOD AND KEEP PRISNERS AWAY
Line_5870	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE UM BOTH PARALLEL TO ARE IN A PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER
Line_5871	NO MATTER WHITCH WAY THE BATTERY IS TURNED UM IT'LL ELECTRICITY ALWAS GO OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ALWASE GOING UM TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5872	THE FLOW IS GOING UP BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AROUND AND THEN THE FLOW WILL BE GOING DOWN
Line_5873	THE POSITIVE SIDE RE SEE THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5874	THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5875	THE MINE SIDE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY OUT THEN IT'S GOING UP ANDTO LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB THEN THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5876	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS TWO FOR EACH
Line_5877	EVERYWARE ON THE LIGHT BULB BULBER IT'S GREEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWES ALL THROUGH IT
Line_5878	THE CIRCLE AT THE LUPS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LITTLE THE PLAIN LINES ARE
Line_5879	EVERYTHING IN IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN A CIRCUIT
Line_5880	IT SURES YOU THAT THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5881	WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5882	WELL SINCE IT'S AN ELECTRO MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO PICK MAGNETIC THINGS UP
Line_5883	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AROUND OR ELSE IT WON'T REALLY WORK
Line_5884	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5885	THAT THE ELECTRICITIEA IS COMPLETELY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_5886	IF YOU HAVE THE SIN IT IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_5887	IT HAS TO BE IN A CLETED CIRCLE AND HACBE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE MAGNET TO WORK
Line_5888	THE WASHERS WILL START STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_5889	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE RIVET TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5890	IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
Line_5891	THE CIRCUIT HAVE TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK AND IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_5892	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH UM PROPERLY BUT IF IT'S NOT UM THEN THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5893	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5894	UM A TEMPORARY MAGNET DOESN'T MEANS IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER SO M ELECTRO MAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS A MAGNET
Line_5895	UM SO MAG THAT SOME MAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5896	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND MAKE THE
Line_5897	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5898	IF THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY TYPE THAT WORKS AS A NORMAL MAGNET THAT WILL STICK TO LIKE A NORMAL MAGNET
Line_5899	IT'S KIND OF PUT THE ENERGY OUT INTO THE WIRES SO IT'S PRITY MUCH LIKE THE SOURCE OF IT
Line_5900	UM THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE UM MORE ELSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5901	THEY LET THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT SO IT CAN LIKE GO TO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT TO GO TO
Line_5902	THEY LET THE UM ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SO THEY CAN LIKE THE PA UP A LITTLE PATHWAY
Line_5903	IT'S KIND OF WHAT THE UM ELECTRICITY GOES TO BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IT NEEDS ELECTRICITY SO
Line_5904	UM RE COW MEANS THAT YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5905	IT USES THE ELECTRICITY TO RAINING
Line_5906	IT'S RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S RUNNING
Line_5907	WENCSE THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING METAL IT THE MOTOR SITS SPINNING
Line_5908	IT'S TOUCHING METAL AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5909	IT'S TOUCHING AND THE METAL
Line_5910	IT'S FLOWING FROUGH AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5911	MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCLE
Line_5912	IT'S GOING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE MOTOR OUT OF THE MOTOR AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_5913	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ETHER LIKE TOUCHING A BATTERY OR METAL
Line_5914	THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES FLOWING TO THE LIL CIRCLE WITH THE THING IN IT
Line_5915	THE CIRCLE WITH THE LUMINET IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5916	A BATTERY ONE SIDE IS THE PLUSS S ONE LINE IS THE PLUSS SIDE THE OTHER SIDE IS THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5917	THERE IS A BATTERY A MOTOR AND TWO WIRES
Line_5918	IT'S A MOTOR UM THE UM IS PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE THE MOTORS STUCKED TO THEM
Line_5919	THE LITTLE LINE IS A DO ON THE END IS A SWITCH
Line_5920	IT SHOES YOU A WAY TO SET UP THE CIRCUIT
Line_5921	HERE MAGNETS USE ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS MAGNETS
Line_5922	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5923	IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRO MAGNET TO WORK
Line_5924	A CLOSED CIRCUIT THAT'S ELECTRICITY FLOW BUT AN OPEN CIRCUIT DOESN'T
Line_5925	THE MORE WINES YOU PUT ON THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS
Line_5926	IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED INES IT SUPER STRONG SO YOU CAN PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIKE FIVE IT COULD ONLY PICK UP LIKE TWO OR THREE
Line_5927	IT HAS MORE ECTRICITY SO IT MAKES MAG THE ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5928	THE MORE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIVET THE STRONGER IT IS
Line_5929	THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UM FOR STUFF
Line_5930	HOW MUCH CHARGED THE BATTERY HAS AND H HOW CLIF AND THE SWITCH
Line_5931	MORE WINES GIVE IT MORE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS SO IF IT HAS MORE WINES THEY CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS
Line_5932	UM YOU CAN WIND IT MORE
Line_5933	THE MORE WINES THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP
Line_5934	IT GETS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN GET
Line_5935	PROBABLY IN A BAR GRA LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TEN WINES THREE WASHERS TWENTY INES FIVE WASHERS AND IT KEEPS STEELLING UP
Line_5936	THE NUMBER IS KEEP GOING UP
Line_5937	THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE STRONGER THE MAGNET GETS
Line_5938	IF IT DOESN'T PICK UP VERY MANY THEN IT THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY WRAPS AND IF IT PICKS UP A LOT HAS A LOT OF WRAPS
Line_5939	WELL Y GOT FIFTEEN AND HALF OF TEN IS FIVE AND TEN ONLY GOT THREE
Line_5940	THE THINGS ON THE LEFT TO THE WIRES ER THE SWITCH MAYBE TO SEE IF IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON
Line_5941	CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEM BEBECAUSE THEY CONDUCT IT KIND OF
Line_5942	THE CONDUCTORS WERE PREY MUCH ALL METAL THINGS AND THEY LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEM
Line_5943	WHAT'S EVER IN THIS CIRCUIT LIKE THE LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR WILL TURN ON
Line_5944	YOU CLOSE THE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF TOUCHING THE SLICH TO METAL YOU PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL ON IT THING TO CLOSE IT
Line_5945	IT CAN CLOSE A CIRCUIT AND E ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH
Line_5946	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THEY DON'T CLOSE THE CIRCUITS SO NOTHING WILL TURN ON
Line_5947	CONDUCTORS LET THE UM CIRCUIT TURN ON BUT INSULATORS DON'T
Line_5948	THE MOTOR STAND STIELL BECAUSE INSULATORS ARE NOT ALWAISE MADE OF METAL
Line_5949	INSULATORS ARE NOT REALLY MADE OF METAL STRAWS WOOD ROCKS AND SPOUNCHES AND NONE OF THEM ARE MADE OF METAL
Line_5950	THEY DON'T CLOSE A CIRCUIT SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON
Line_5951	THEY'RE PREY MUCH LIKE THE OPPOSITE CONDUCTORS THEY CAN CLOSE A CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL USUALLY
Line_5952	IRON AND STEEL WHICH ARE BOTH METAL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5953	THEIR IRON OR STEEL
Line_5954	MY NAME IS KEEP IN A BLOSSOM
Line_5955	UM MAGNET AS A MAGNET MAGNET ATTRACTS IRON
Line_5956	BECAUSE IN OUR PLASSROUM WE WEIGH UM TO WEIGHT WE'RE DORING MAGNETISM AND AR TOCHERS SAID THAT
Line_5957	EY WERE PULL AND ATTRACT
Line_5958	WELL THE END AND THE END BOUNCE OFF AND THE END AND THE ES COME TOGETHER AND THEN ESS AND THE END COM TOGETHER BUT THE ESS AND THE ES BOUNCE OFF
Line_5959	O GREY AM JON
Line_5960	WELL THEY HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE BRATS AND THE BRADS HAVE TO BE ATTACHED ANOTHER WIRE UNDER UNDER THE BORD
Line_5961	THEIR THEY ARE CALLED BRATS OR COMPONENTS ARE MEAN CONDUCTORS
Line_5962	IF IF THE BRAS WERN'T METAL THAT MEANS ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT IF THEY WOULD JUST IT WOULDN'T JUST GO THROUGH IT AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULD
Line_5963	UM WELL THE WIRE UNDERNEATH THE BALLS UM MAKES THE IT MAKES IT'S A WHO CIRCUIT
Line_5964	BECAUSE THE IRON BECAUSE THE IRON IN THEM UM ATTRACTS TO EACH OTHER
Line_5965	IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPEL AND THEY RETRACT
Line_5966	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE REALLY STRONG AND THEY CAN GO THROUGH REALLY THICK UM THINGS
Line_5967	WELL IF IT GOES THROUGH THINGS THAT MEANS THE MAGNET REALLY HRONG
Line_5968	UM A TABLE UM UM A WASHER
Line_5969	WELL THE THICK NESS IS LIKE
Line_5970	OUT WERE ALL THE MAGNETIC UM WERE THE MAGNET IS MAKING UM THE NAIL
Line_5971	IT STOPS THAT THIS MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE UM NAIL SO THAT IT WILL ATTRACT TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5972	YOU HAVE TO UM SLIDE THE MAGNET ACROSS THE UHM NAIL SO IT WOULD MAKE A MAGNETIC FIELD TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5973	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT Y I DON'T KNOW IT WAIT
Line_5974	WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE IT HAS WIRES AND IT ON THE IT WELL IT MAKES IT'S A CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT
Line_5975	ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE
Line_5976	BECAUSE ONE THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB UM AND TWO WIRES AND THE OTHERE THERE IS THREE WIRES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5977	'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5978	WELL IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND IT FLOWS OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5979	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS TO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE L
Line_5980	WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5981	WELL IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS ON AND UM BE LIT AS MUCH
Line_5982	WELL IF THERE IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERYS THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T BE AS LIGHT
Line_5983	WELL THE ENERGY UM FLOWS THROUGH UM BOTH BATTERIES AND GETS MORE POWER TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS MORE
Line_5984	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIGHT MORE AND THE ONE WAS ONE BATTERY WOULD UM BE LIGHT LESS
Line_5985	UM THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES IS LIT UM MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS A LOT MORE RIGHT AND THEN THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY MAKES LIGHT BULBS UM DEM
Line_5986	IF YOU DID IT ADD ANOTHER BATTERY OR MORE POWER AND THE LIGHT IT BULBS WOULD BE STILL DIM
Line_5987	UM THE ENERGY UM IS MORE PIS MORE POWERED AND IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT MORE
Line_5988	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IT'S WHEN
Line_5989	WELL WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL SERIES CIRCUIT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
Line_5990	WELL HERE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES AND WIRES CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_5991	UM WE'RE WE STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5992	HERE IS TWO UM PATHWAY IS ONE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RAIN THERE IS ONLY ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_5993	UM I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER IT
Line_5994	THE BLUE DOTS IS THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING REALLY FAST TROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5995	GOING INTO THE BATTERY AT THE UM POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GETTING RE CHARGED AND GOING BACK TROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POWERING LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
Line_5996	UM THERE IS TWO UM LIGHT BULBS BOTH POWERED A LOT AND TWO FOR UM WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5997	IT'S UM IT'S SHOWING TWO LIGHT BULBS FOR WIRES AND UM A BATTERY OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5998	THE METAL SIMBLE UM HEY PROENTS A BATTERY
Line_5999	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6000	HERE IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM THE LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6001	IRCUIT MEANS THAT THE UM WIRES ARE NEVER TOUCHING AND THEY'RE JUST GOING UM ON AND THEY NEVER TOUCH
Line_6002	IT TELLS ME THAT THE THAT THE BATTERY CHARGES BOTH LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6003	THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
Line_6004	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_6005	MEANS IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO ELECTRICITY WILL TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_6006	UM WELL IT'S IMPORTANT I DON'T
Line_6007	CH IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT CAN TURN OFF THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OR ON THE REST CIRCUIT
Line_6008	L
Line_6009	UM NOT
Line_6010	IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN WAS HOLDING IT UM AND IT WAS PUTTING IT AGAINST THE WASHERS THEY IT WASN'T PICKING IT UP AT ANY WASHERS
Line_6011	WELL THE THE WIRES ARE RAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET SO THAT THE RIVER CAN UM PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6012	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM LIKE STEEL OR IRON
Line_6013	WE WENT UM WE WRAPPED IT AROUND FIVE AND THEN TEN TIMES AND THEN FIFTEEN AND THEN TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN THIRTY
Line_6014	IF YOU IT SHOWS THAT THAT IF YOU YOU WRAPPED IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MEANS IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6015	MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM THAT YOU WRAP THE WIRE UM A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET
Line_6016	WELL IT'S IT GETS MORE STRAINTH BY IF YOU RAP IT AROUND IF YOU RAP IF YOU HAP THE RIRES AROUND IT MORE
Line_6017	IF IT PICKS UP OR WASHER SOME MEANS IT'S AN ELECTRO MAGNET IS STRONGER
Line_6018	BY WRAPPING THE UM THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET LIKE MORE
Line_6019	WELL THE MORE YOU WIND IT AROUND THE RIVER UM THE MORE YOU WIND THE WIRES AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6020	BUT IF IF YOU KEEP UM WRAPPING IT AROUND MORE AROUND THE VERT THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6021	IT'S STRONGER THAN A WASHER THAT PICKS UP A F WASHE WASHERS
Line_6022	IT GETS STRONGER BECAUSE MORE ELECTRICITY IS GOING AROUND IT SO IT GETS STRONGER AND IT CAN PICK UP MORE
Line_6023	WELL IT SHOES THAT WHEN I INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RAPS THE MORE WASHERS LIKE GETS SO
Line_6024	NO YEAH
Line_6025	UM WELL THE NUMBER WRAPS GETS HIRED SO LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FOR FIFTY ICY SEVENTY EAT NINTY HUNDRED
Line_6026	NUMBER WRAPS GETS LARGER THE UM THE HIR THE LITTLE GREEN DOSS GO AND THE HIGER THE UM THE GREEN LIGN GOES
Line_6027	THE WASHERS ARE UM GETTING SO THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE WASHERS THEN MORE WRAPS
Line_6028	WELL INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT THAT IF YOU PUT ATTACH THEM TO THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY WON'T THROUGH THROUGH HIM AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6029	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH THE UM ROCK OR THE SPONGE AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6030	IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING IF PUT A CONDUCTOR ATTACH TO THE WIRE THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING
Line_6031	ELL THE SHALL IS MADE OF PLASTIC SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_6032	THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS AND THEY ALL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6033	STEEL METAL ALUMINIUM ANYTHING THAT CAN STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_6034	WELL METAL HAS IRON IN IT AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IRON AND CERTAIN THINGS TO STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6035	YES MARNEY YOU DID REPEATCH YOUR SELF AND YOU DID A FIRST GOOD CHA
Line_6036	IVE BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME
Line_6037	SOME OF THEM WILL STICK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM WALKED
Line_6038	VERY WELL AN HAVING SO MUCH FON HOW BUT YOU
Line_6039	WELL THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BORDS AND THEY HAVE BRADS AND THEY HAVE A WIRES THROUGH THERE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WIRE IS TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_6040	WELL IF THERE IS NO WIRE BEHIND THE BORB THEN THE LIGHT BULB OR THE MOTOR WOULD NEVER LIGHT UP
Line_6041	WELL THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE RUNNING FROM EACH END OF THE RAT
Line_6042	WELL THEY'RE E TO PUT SURE WIR TWO AND THEIR METAL
Line_6043	WELL METAL WELL ELECTRICITY CAN RUN THROUGH METAL OND THIS CACE IT IS METAL AND SO IT JUST THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BRAD AND YEAH
Line_6044	WELL BE HIND EACH ROW THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED
Line_6045	IT TELLS ME THAT BEHIND AND BRADS ARE CONNECTED TO A SMALL WIRE THAT COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT
Line_6046	WLL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING KAON
Line_6047	I THINK THEY FORCED THE MAGNET UM I'M PRINTY SURE THAT IT'S SO FORCE JUST BECAUSE I GUESS
Line_6048	WELL I SORT OF DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS IS DOING
Line_6049	OH I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPOLREVERY MAGNET
Line_6050	M YOU HAVE TO RIVER IT ON TOP THE NAIL OR STICK IT ON THE END FOR A LITTLE WIL SO THE MAGNET FIELD CAN GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_6051	THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPLE RED MAGNET
Line_6052	LET SO WEIGH HING ON
Line_6053	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND UM TRYING TO LIKE TWO LIGHT BULBS YEAH
Line_6054	WELL THE ELECTRICITY GOES SORT OF ON A PATHWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6055	WELL ONE OF THEM IS POWERING TWO BATTERIES I MEAN TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6056	WELL THE SOL HAVE TO SHARE THE ELECTRICITY SO ONE THEN SO THEY BOTH GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER SO THEY CAN BOTH GET LIGHT UP
Line_6057	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_6058	WE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6059	WELL THE BLUDOD SORT SHOW ELECTRICITY I GUESS
Line_6060	WELL OF COURSE THE ELECTRICITACITY FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BATTERY INTO THE POS SIDE BATTERY
Line_6061	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO BOTH BATTERY AND MEAN THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
Line_6062	WELL THE IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6063	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT IT INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_6064	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_6065	UM THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_6066	IT REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE WAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6067	WELL IT WORKS BOTH WAIGHS IT JUST REVERSES THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_6068	LEL FLOW IS THE WEIGH IT'S LIKE A PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_6069	WELL IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP A LIT MORE
Line_6070	WELL A F AMELY JUST LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB A LOT MORE
Line_6071	THERE IS MORE UM ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY WHICH MEANS IT FLOWS FASTER
Line_6072	HEY LID UP THEY THEY LID UP A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_6073	THEE GET A LOT BOTH LIGHT BULBS GET A LOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT SAMES AS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THE ROME BATTERY SO THEY EACH COULD POWER THE SAME
Line_6074	WELL WHEN THERE TWO BATTERIES THEY BELL THEY LIGHT UP A LOT RIGHTER AND ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS MUCH
Line_6075	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING AND IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILN'T WORK
Line_6076	MARNEY HAVE RANDY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_6077	ONE THEY GET FASTER
Line_6078	THEY GET UM THE ELECTRICITY GETS FASTER
Line_6079	VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_6080	UM THE FORCE GETS WEAKER
Line_6081	THE FORCIS UM STRONGER
Line_6082	WELL WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE PUT WASHERS INTO CUP AY
Line_6083	THEYE RU WHAT'S IT CALLED THEY ARE LIKE CHIPS THE CHIPS ARE BETWEEN IT UM SO IT IT WEAKANS THE FORCE
Line_6084	UM ADDING SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNET UM WE CENS THE FORCE YOU NO OF THE MAGNETS
Line_6085	THE DISTANCE GETS THEY'RE FARTHER APART WHICH MEANS IT WE CAN THE FORCE
Line_6086	DON'T MEAN A B AND D
Line_6087	AY B AN D GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE THEY DID THE SAME PERCEATERS BUT GROUP E DIDN'T
Line_6088	AM ONDERFLE HOW ARE YOU
Line_6089	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MAKING ELECTROW MAGNETS
Line_6090	WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T SAY THAT
Line_6091	IT'S RAP VERY NEATLY
Line_6092	IT'S CALLED A STEEL RIVET
Line_6093	UM SO SO THE WIRE CAN FLOW THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_6094	WELL THERE ARE WASHERS DOWN THERE AND IT'S SORT OF AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6095	WELL YOU NEED THE THINGS WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING PART IF THERE'S NOT ONE PART THEN THE CIRCUIT JUST AT WORK
Line_6096	WE NEAD A RAPED AROUND THE THE RIVET VERY VERY LIKE SIZE
Line_6097	THE WASHERS COME UP AND LIKE UM CONNECT TO THE RIVET
Line_6098	WELL RIGHT NOW IT'S UM LIKE CLOSED
Line_6099	WELL IT JUST IT WHATEVER THE ELECTRO MAGNET HAD PICKED UP IT DROPS
Line_6100	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THE WASHERS GO UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6101	THEN THE WASHERS GO BACK UP ONTO THE RIVETS
Line_6102	WELL WITH OUT THE ELECTRICITY THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD JUST BE A PLAIN RAVET BUT YOU NEED THE ELECTRICITY TO GO INTO THE RIVET AND PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_6103	M BECAUSE UM
Line_6104	UM THE RIVETOR COR HAS BEEN MADE FROM IRON TO BE AN TEMPORYMAGNET
Line_6105	WELL THAT YEAH IT JUST NEED TO BE RAPER AND SOMETHING MADE IRON TO BE A TEMPORY MAGNET APPER AND SOMETHING LIKE ESTIMATE A PLASTIC THE THING WON'T HAPPEN
Line_6106	VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6107	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_6108	YOU NEED A SWITCH MOTOR A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_6109	THE BATTERY IS THE SOURCE AND THE SOURCE GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO UM TO JUST SEND THE ELECTRICITY DOWN TO WHATEVER IT'S CLOSED TO DO
Line_6110	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE POT FROM THE THE NEGATIVE END OF THE D CELL BACK TO THE POSITIVE
Line_6111	WELL THE MOTOR IS WHAT A MOTOR COULD BE THE RECEIVER IT COULD BE UM THE MOTOR CAN BE A RECEIVER IT IS A RECEIVER
Line_6112	RECEIVE SOMETHING THAT A RECEIVER IS THE THING THAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6113	MARNEY I DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6114	THE MOTOR IS UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_6115	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVERY WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED
Line_6116	THE BULBS UM THE LIGHE IT THE LONGER LIGN THE SHORT LINE LONG LIN EVER THE BATTERY AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE LITTLE LUP AND THE MIDDL IS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6117	THE UM IS FOR THE MOTOR
Line_6118	WE MAKE AND UM UH UM A AND A A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6119	IT'S IN A WASHER CONDUCTOR TWO
Line_6120	INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND THEY BLOCK ELECTRICITY FROM COMING THROUGH
Line_6121	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THRILL FLOW THROUGH THEM AND CONDUCTORS DO
Line_6122	WELL ONLY METAL ONES WORK AS ONLY
Line_6123	UM I WAS TALKING
Line_6124	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED WHEN YOU HAD AN INSULATOR I MEAN OPEN WHEN YOU HAD AN INSULATOR
Line_6125	IT'S CLOSED
Line_6126	WELL YOU CAN MAKE METAL INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6127	IT UM IT HAS TO BE UM LIKE STEEL
Line_6128	THEY ALL HAVE TO BE UM STEEL METAL
Line_6129	I HAVE IT TO WORK
Line_6130	YES I DO GET THAT MARNEY
Line_6131	ESS I AM READY
Line_6132	WELL WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE SUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6133	WE HAVE OBSERVED HOW IT CONNECTS TO THINGS AND HOW IT CAN STICK TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETICK
Line_6134	UM CAN YOU REPEATE THAT PLEASE
Line_6135	THEY CONNECT THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND THAT HAVE IRON IN THEM MOST OF THE TIME
Line_6136	AND THAT'S WHY E UM THEN CONNECT
Line_6137	BUT THEN THE BOTTOM ONE S WERE CONNECTING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALUMINIUM IN THEM
Line_6138	THEY ARE CLICKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_6139	PUSHED AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALUMINIUM AND NOT IRON LIKE THE OTHER ONES
Line_6140	THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON AND THEM PUT THE FOR TWO IN THE MIDDAL YOU DON'T HAVE ANY THING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ALUMINIUM
Line_6141	BY IT MEATING YEAUH GO BYE
Line_6142	OU DON'T WANT TO GET BERRMEED
Line_6143	RE MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_6144	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS MA IT FLOWS THROUGH METAL
Line_6145	OR HAM HAS TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE TO GET A SWITCH
Line_6146	T LIGHTS THE BULB UP IF IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IT MAKES ELECTRICITY AND YES
Line_6147	B WE NEED TO GO BYE
Line_6148	HOW NOW
Line_6149	JUST RUN JUST ONE MINIT
Line_6150	BUT WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE MAGNET WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT'S EVERYTHING WILL FALL AND THEN THE PAPER CLIP WON'T BE CONNECTED TO THE NAIL BUT THE NAIL WON'T BE CONNECTED
Line_6151	WHEN THE MAGNET IS IS ON THE NAIL IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN WHEN YOU LET GO UP THE MAGNET IT L GOES
Line_6152	THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE TEMERY MAGNET
Line_6153	UM THEN WHAT HAPEND WAS
Line_6154	WEIGH SO W
Line_6155	WE'VE BEEN DOING PATHWAYS AND ELECTRICITY LIKE IT STUFF
Line_6156	UM IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT FLOWS IS THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE IF E
Line_6157	A CIRCUIT IS WHERE IT GOES ALL WAIST THROUGH AND HAS A BEAR IN IT AND SO
Line_6158	UM THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6159	IT CIRCLES AROUND THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WORKS
Line_6160	THE BATTERY HAS TO BE POSITION A
Line_6161	ON THE FIRST MIXTURE THEN ON THE SECANT MIXTURE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6162	THEY CAM PAR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP
Line_6163	UM ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WITCH BUT THEN THEY'RE THEY'RE POINTING THE SAME WAY SO LET'S CAUSING IT TO NO
Line_6164	IT'S DIMMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FULL FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6165	IT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE ONES IN AND ONES FULLY LITTLE
Line_6166	WELL THE BLUE DOTS KEEP GOING AND GOING UNTILL THEY STOP WHEN YOU JUST CONNECT THE WIRES
Line_6167	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE WLIGHT BULB
Line_6168	THEY'RE IFTY NEG W
Line_6169	UM IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SO THAT IT SHOWS ME THAT THERE THERE IS A FLOW BUT IF THERE IS NOT A FLOW THEN THE LIGHT BUBWILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_6170	WHEN YOU SWITCH IT IT GOES ONE DIRECTION BUT THEN WHEN YOU SWITCH IT LIKE THAT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_6171	IT ALWAYS FLOWS UH POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6172	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE POSITIVE
Line_6173	IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH WEIGH
Line_6174	IT WORKS LIKE IT DID BEFOR BUT JUST A LITTLE MORE POWER
Line_6175	I NOTICE THAT THEY WERE BOTH FLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_6176	THAT ACTUALLY ONE D CELL CAN BE
Line_6177	THEY'RE LINED UP THE SAME BUT THERE IS BUT THE ELECTRICITY JUST FLOWING A DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
Line_6178	WELL IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6179	IT MAKES IT HAVE MORE POWER AND LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6180	UM IT LIGHTS UP MORE BECAUSE OF THE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY
Line_6181	IT'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6182	UM ELECTRICITY MOSTLY
Line_6183	I PICK IT OUT THAT'S UM
Line_6184	IT REPRENS TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCH
Line_6185	TALK M WE ALL WAYS
Line_6186	WE'VE BEEN DEELING WITH MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM
Line_6187	THERE WAS NINT TEEN WASHERS
Line_6188	THEY'RE WEIGH WHAT IS
Line_6189	WHAT'S HAPINING IS THAT THE MAGNETS HAVE ENOUFF FORCED TO GET THROUGH ONE SPACER SO IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP B AND IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP A
Line_6190	THERE WAS ENUFF SPACERS THAT IT TOOK THAT THE FORCE COULD STICK TOGETHER AND IT THEY WOULDN'T STICK SO
Line_6191	FIVE SPACERS NEEDED THREE THREE WASHERS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS ENUGF
Line_6192	EY ARE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_6193	H JUST FOLLOW THE ROLES AND LOOK OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THAT'S WAT THEY COUNT DO S
Line_6194	Y B IN D NINTEEN WASHERS AND THAT WAS ENOUGH IN THE OTHER PICXTURES THAT USUALLY MAKE TO JUST CONNECT IT AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUFF FORCE
Line_6195	TOOK NINTEEN WASHERS AND A NINE WASHERS AND B DIRTY TOOK NINTE WASHERS AND THEN IT GROUPS SAME FIVE
Line_6196	SPACERS AND THEN THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN
Line_6197	A NINTEEN B NINTEEN SEE FIVE D NINTE
Line_6198	IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEN RIVT IT CAN PICK UP
Line_6199	UM YOU MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE OF THE THE RIVET CON HAS MOST OF THE ENERGY
Line_6200	IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE IS MAGNETISM IN IT AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN IT
Line_6201	PROBABLY A WASHER MAKE IT WORK BUT IT SOMETIMES WON'T
Line_6202	I'M SORY WOOD
Line_6203	UM WELL IT JUST KIND OF CONNECT BECAUSE OF THE FLOW UP THEY PROBABLY
Line_6204	FLOW IS THE BASALLYTR IS DOING IF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OR IF IT IS NOT
Line_6205	L THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S CLOSED THERE IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY SO FLON'T A
Line_6206	IT HAS TO BE UM CLOSED FOR TO ATTRACT IT
Line_6207	IT HAS TO BE MADE FRUM
Line_6208	UM IT RANGE BATTERY POWER WHEN THEY'RE USED TWO MUCH AND IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP IT'LL F BUT YEAH IT MANURE THE THING YOU JUST MENASURED TO MEAN
Line_6209	IT'S A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB STAND WIRES AND A LITTLE STAND FOR EVERYTHING TO GO INTO
Line_6210	YOU HAVE ENOUFF POWER AND THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN LIKE DASH IN THE BATTERY D CELL
Line_6211	WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE IT RECEIVES THE BATTERY AND THE POWER AND ELECTRICITY
Line_6212	WHAT IT CAN DO IS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT GOES POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE
Line_6213	THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATTIVE INTO THE BOTTOM INTO THE SIDE
Line_6214	BUT AFTER THAT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING IT WILL JUST STAY THERE AND YEAH
Line_6215	UM ELECTRICITY AND IT FLOWS YEAH AND JUST FLOWS AND STUFF
Line_6216	UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6217	UM THE BATTERY HELPS THAT AND IT MADE IT WORK
Line_6218	IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IT CAN FLOW TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WEIGHT THAT IT FLOWS AND SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_6219	UM IT LIGHTS TO LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6220	UM ONE GOES TO THE SIDE AND ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6221	AND THE NEGATIVE GIFTS TO THE SIDE
Line_6222	MOST BECAUSE THERE NOTHING FLOWING IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_6223	SO THE POSITIVE GOES NEGEATIV
Line_6224	THE BUBLIS CLOSED IT'S NOT OPERAM
Line_6225	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT STUFF TO MAKE LIKE A SWITCH WORK AND MAKE THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_6226	SO THE SWITCH IS WHAT CONTAINS THE UM
Line_6227	HUM LIKE HELPS THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6228	UM THE D CELL BATTERY UM CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_6229	THE D CELL MAKES LIT LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE WIRES AND THEN THE MOTOR
Line_6230	ELECTRICITY
Line_6231	UM IT HELPS THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6232	IT CARYS ELECTRICITY POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6233	IT CONNECTS AND THAT MAKES IT BOTH LIGHT UP AND THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6234	SARY CAN YOU REPETE THAT AGAIN
Line_6235	IT RECEIVES IT AND THEN SHIPS IT OFF TO NO ARLENDSSAR
Line_6236	UM IT MAKES IT WORK WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT IT SHUTS EVERYTHING OFF WELL
Line_6237	LEVULE
Line_6238	IT'S MAKING EVERY THING GO CREASY
Line_6239	UM WHAT IT'S HAPNING IS IT'S CLOSED SO THAT IT'S MAKING THE FLAG GO THROUGH
Line_6240	IT'S LOWERING AND FLOWING SLOWING AND FLOWING AND UM FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_6241	WIRES BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6242	IT'S LETTING THE WIRES TOUCH THE MOTOR AND HELPING IT GO ON AND ON
Line_6243	THE LIGHT BULB W
Line_6244	IT'S PROBABLY WA I DIDN'T WORK
Line_6245	WELL SH WELL IT'S JUST A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH
Line_6246	UM THE LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTING TO THE WIRE IS UM AND THERE IS A PATHWAY FOR LETTING IT GO THROUGH
Line_6247	A BATTERY A BATTERY THAT HAS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_6248	THE MOTOR
Line_6249	HE THOSE ARE THE WIRES CONNECT
Line_6250	BATTERY A MOTOR AND UM WHAT IS THIS
Line_6251	WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_6252	THEY VARY VERY STRONG
Line_6253	THERE'S A RIVET AND WASHERS AND THE RAVETS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_6254	IRON
Line_6255	WASHER IS IN THE RIVET
Line_6256	IT CLOSED
Line_6257	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STRONG SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6258	THAT THERE IS A WATER WINES
Line_6259	FORTY THREE ILLAMITES THERE IS FORTY THREE WASHERS THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH
Line_6260	UM THE MORE WIRES YOU PUT IN PROBLY
Line_6261	THE BATTERY PROBABLY LIKES THE POWER
Line_6262	IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS
Line_6263	UM YOU RAN IF YOU RAT
Line_6264	YOOR BATTERY PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD NEED MORE OF THE POWER BUT THEN
Line_6265	IT IT WETS IT DOESN'T BRING UP A WA BUT IT USUALLY DAS B
Line_6266	THEN IT'S PROABBLY NOT A ONE HAVING
Line_6267	THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_6268	GRASS UNDER GRA WOULD BE GOOD PROBLEY
Line_6269	ON THE SIDE OF THE GRAFT IT RUNS HOW MANY WASHERS ARE PICKED UP
Line_6270	RARE WASHERS TO PICK UP
Line_6271	IT INCREASES BY TO AND THEN UP TO ONE
Line_6272	IT GOES TO FIFTEEN STEEL BUT IT'S GOING FASTER AND
Line_6273	AND I I LIKE UM WHAT THEY DO HER THEY MICK IT UP TO GO TO THE SERAW
Line_6274	THEN THERE'S A LOT OF STRENGTH
Line_6275	THIRTY THIRTY PROBABLY
Line_6276	PROBABLY TWENTY R TWENY FIVE
Line_6277	WE'VE BEEN DOING MAGNETISM AND SEEING UM WHAT COULD MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_6278	UM W IF YOU TAKE IN AN ALUMINIUM NAIL IT ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE MOTOR WORK IF YOU CONNECT THE TWO WIRES TO IT
Line_6279	A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET A MOTOR WORK
Line_6280	UM IF THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS MAKING IT WORK THE MOTOR IS RIGHT
Line_6281	TALK TO ME WEIGHT
Line_6282	INSULATORS ARE STUFF THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM AND THAT DON'T WORK
Line_6283	EY DON'T INSULATORS DON'T HAVE ANY THEY WON'T LET THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM
Line_6284	WHEN I CLICKED THE SPOUNGE THE MOTOR DIDN'T WORK IT JUST SAT THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE
Line_6285	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK THE INSULATOR SHUTS DOWN
Line_6286	A METAL A METAL CAN STICK TO IT
Line_6287	AND THE ALUMINIUM ONE DOESN'T HAVE ANY METAL OR IRON
Line_6288	A STEEL NAIL WILL USE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND A
Line_6289	MASSWEIGHT
Line_6290	IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6291	I DON'T UNDER STAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY UM SO
Line_6292	THEY YOU HAVE TO DIFFERENT CAPACITY
Line_6293	UM YOU COULD HOT TO THE BERON MUS
Line_6294	YOU HAVE TO FILL IT TO THE BUM
Line_6295	YOU COULD TAKE A CIRINGE AND POR ONE WATER TWO WATERS AND STIMSO UN TILL YOU GET
Line_6296	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORY BUT I DON'T
Line_6297	OU OULD TAKE AR SERANION TO IT YES
Line_6298	MASS OF ACTUALLY VOLUITE OKAY
Line_6299	IT CAN UM AND SO IS YOU WEIGH
Line_6300	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS BUT INSTEAD IT HOLDS THREE HUND
Line_6301	IT'S AS MUCH AS THE CARON CAN POSIBILY HOLDER
Line_6302	THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6303	IT'S THE CLING AS MUCH AS IT CLIT
Line_6304	THE UM IT WAS HOW MUCH COULDN'T THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY
Line_6305	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILL LITERS
Line_6306	THI CAN REALLY ANSWER THAT IF MY LEBLUM NOLAGE NOT A THING LETUM DON PUT
Line_6307	THE M IS WET THERE AND THE COMPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSABLY HOLPS THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PICTURE
Line_6308	CAPACITY IS HIER THAN THE VOLIAM
Line_6309	I THEN MOST IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE TO RANGE HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_6310	MEASURED MASS THE CAPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLIUM
Line_6311	THERE WAS AENUFF WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_6312	THE TWINTS OR THEY UNOFIDE
Line_6313	EVERY TENE MILLILLIGERS
Line_6314	YOU COULD USE CIRRINCHES AND JUST MEASURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE ES IS
Line_6315	YOU COULD JUST USE THE SIRINGE AND STUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_6316	IT STICKS UP WATER AND THEN SIT OUT WHEN YOU PUT POLE SIN PUSHS
Line_6317	IT'S FITY IT'S FIFTY NO
Line_6318	YOU COULD SQOWIT THIN TO A METER BIGER NOT A METER
Line_6319	IT WOULD FOLLOW IT ON A B C
Line_6320	UH BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE SYRINGE WILL EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE
Line_6321	YOU COULD FICK IT OUT I FORGET WHAT IT WAS GOING TO SAY
Line_6322	I YOU'RE WELCOM GOOD BYE
Line_6323	YEAHWE HAD
Line_6324	CAPACITY IS THE MEASUREMENT O UM SOME C CAPACITY
Line_6325	HOW MUCH WATER SOMETHING IS AND THIS PACK TRAY IS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLIMETERS IT'S JUST A FAST
Line_6326	M I'M NOTSHERE
Line_6327	HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN THE CUP
Line_6328	WE TOOK SODA CANS TO SEE IF THE SODA CAN THE TRICH OUTER OR DID NOT TELL THE TRICTH ABOUT IT
Line_6329	AND WE DIDN'T FILL OUR CCAMS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALWASE FILLED O TH WAY TO THE TOP SO YOU SHAKE THE CAUSE YOU SHAKE THIS OUT OF BEFORE YOU HELP IN IT
Line_6330	WEE YEISED WE LEFTD A LITTLE SPACE IN SIDE AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER I LEARNED OUT HOW MUCH WATER THAT WAS
Line_6331	MEANS THAT THERE'S THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_6332	IT COULD ACT IT WILL ACTUALLY HURT HOME THEN IT SAYS BECAUSE
Line_6333	I'M NOT A
Line_6334	ELL THE CAPACITY PASED
Line_6335	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MELLMETERS
Line_6336	THE RANGE IS ON THE FAR LEFT AND THE METAL THERE IS A GRADGUATED SILUNDER AND ON THE SIDE IS ONE LITER
Line_6337	MEASURE THINGS OR WATER FOR COKING
Line_6338	UM WHAT WE DO FOR MEASURING THINGS WE YES IT'SH TALL
Line_6339	YOU JUST CREATE HOW MUCH
Line_6340	HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS AND ALL THE CERANAGES PUT TOGETHER
Line_6341	THE UNITS WE USED OURE MILLLIT S MILLLITERS UM LITERS
Line_6342	YOU WOULD MEASURE HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS
Line_6343	NEED OTHER TO MEASURE CAPACITY SORENGERS AND ALWAYS THE BEST TOOL COULD STUCK UP THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_6344	YOU LOOKED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TALE
Line_6345	YOU COULD SENCE THAT IT WAS CALLED
Line_6346	UM A THERMOMETER BECAUSE THERMOMETER IS CONSOLUTIF THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_6347	IT MEASURES SOMETHING AND THE THING THAT THE THERMOMETER MEASURES IS TEMPERATURE ELCES DIGREES OR FAR N HEIGHT DIGREES
Line_6348	THE THERD AND FIRST UP ARE HOTTER THAN THE SECANDT AND THE FIRST CUP
Line_6349	IT GETS SWAMER
Line_6350	WE TOOK THE ICE WATER AND
Line_6351	IT'S FIFTY DIGREES SOUTH SO IT'S WARMER THAN THE WATER ON THE LEFT WHICH IS TEN DIGREES ES
Line_6352	TELLS YOU THAT THE WATERS WARMER THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LOW WATER
Line_6353	THE WATER THIS MARK TUNDEGARE IS SALCES DEGRA ALSO ES
Line_6354	IT'S NEXT BY MARNEY
Line_6355	UND THE KILUM AND AND SOUTH SEE A SCREEN
Line_6356	WELL I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT COLDER AND U
Line_6357	THEY HAVE BEEN AND THE FOREST HI
Line_6358	A LO AND THEY GOT REALLY COLD AND WE PUT A UNTIL PUT OUR HANDS AND WHICH WAS SAT BECAUSE WE WERE HOT
Line_6359	IT IT IT GETS ITS STAYS THE SAME AND THEN GET WHAT THEY WANT
Line_6360	WELL IT STARTED REALLY HI AND THEN IT FHOUHT COLDER AND COLDER
Line_6361	THE LITTLE RED LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE BLUDD GOES DOWN
Line_6362	STONES SORE IT STARTED HI
Line_6363	WELL IT'S GETING COLDER AND COME ON PAPER
Line_6364	IT TAKES THE MORE SPACE AND STARTS TO BURN
Line_6365	I JUST PLAD IT WA ON THE WIN
Line_6366	I DROUGH IT WITH LITTLE DOTS ON THE WIN GRA
Line_6367	IT IT'S THAT PU IT GOES
Line_6368	WELL IT HELPS YOU
Line_6369	IS AND THAT'S HOW MANY AND YEAH
Line_6370	I PUT THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MINTS OF HOW LONG IT HAD
Line_6371	THE DOTS ARE WHIT THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND THEN THE DOTS SHOW I MOVING DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND WHATEVER
Line_6372	UNTY DIGRAYES
Line_6373	YOU'LL SEE HOW MANY MINTS ARE BEEN BETWEEN TWENTY AM S HERE OUT
Line_6374	UM UM O CHEAY
Line_6375	STARTING THE FIRST NUMBER AND UN THEN OUT THE LAST NUMBER
Line_6376	TE STARED IT AND AT TWENTY IT'S FIFTEEN
Line_6377	UM IF YOU TIRE R
Line_6378	THE FIRST O ARE BELLOW FIFTY AND THE SECUANT TO ARE OVER
Line_6379	THE FIRST THEY WERE LOWER THAN FIFTY N THE SECUND ARE
Line_6380	Y MIN AND SERIES S
Line_6381	WHAT WE ARE MA CAL IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MUNY
Line_6382	TO MEASURE THINGS AND SO SOME CANDLE STICK THERE LITTLE LONGER THAN YOU HAD STICK
Line_6383	YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS AND IT'S MAINLY ABOUT HOW LONG IT IS
Line_6384	SO WE PUT ONE STRAW IN FRUNT OF ANOTHER STRAW ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS TABLE TO FICGGER OUT HOW LONG THE TABLE WAS
Line_6385	WE WORKED ON USING THIS STRAWS
Line_6386	IT THINK THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIN AS SOMETIMES
Line_6387	WE HAD DIFFERENT LENGTH OF STRAWS TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENT S IT COULD LOOK LIKE I THINK
Line_6388	IT WAS SEVAND STRAWS FOR GROUP
Line_6389	THEY'RE THE SAME FOR THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS
Line_6390	YOU NEED TO USE THE SAME SIES
Line_6391	IT MEANS KILOMETERS
Line_6392	AND UM MOST AVERAGE THE AN THE ENTIRE WORLD
Line_6393	SO WIT HAS TO MADE IT AND WE M AND THE PINKIES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT
Line_6394	YES UM TO I'M NOT SHA
Line_6395	BECAUSE THAT SH BECAUSE THEY SHARE YOUR NUMBERS AND IT'S ESIER SO YOU NO
Line_6396	HAT WAS THERE IS IN SCIENCE BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU MEASURE
Line_6397	THEY'RE ALL SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT ECIS
Line_6398	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT SICES HAVE THINGS AND IT'S A SCIENTIFIC WAY AND LENGTH AND WAS
Line_6399	THERE IS ONE ENCH AND THE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
Line_6400	YOU HAVE PINKKE OR YOUR HAND AND YOUR FAT
Line_6401	THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
Line_6402	WELL IT SEAMES CIND THAT'S LIKE YEH M
Line_6403	MEASURING WHAT'S YOUR PINKE OR WHAT'S YOUR HAND OR FEET OR PART OF YOUR BODDY BY MEASURING IT THAT WAY
Line_6404	WELL IF THE HAND IS FIVE INCHES I MEAN TEN INCHES LONG SO THEN THE SIDE WILL BE ABOUT
Line_6405	WELL THE LIGHT BORBS ESTIMATE WOULD ROW UP LAYBE FOR ROLEARS LONG WHICH WOULD BE
Line_6406	WELL IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING A TON OF TIMES YOU'RE PROBABLY WHEN THE TIME IS GOING TO GET THE RIGHT ESTIMATE SO IT HELPS YOU
Line_6407	ETTING BETTER AND ESTIMATING BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU'LL GET BETTER AND GET THE CLOSER AS TO MAN
Line_6408	YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6409	AT THE WHORCE FRANCE YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE CARRYING MEASURING PAPER OUT BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG YOUR WHOURCE WAS YOULD PROBABLY NEED TO ECSTIMATE
Line_6410	USE A MEASURING TAPE OR THEUSE YOUR HAND OR RAFERAM
Line_6411	IT HELPS YOU PER OUT HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6412	BECAUSE METER TAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND HANDS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6413	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_6414	IT SHOWES YOU THAT IF YOU BEGIN AT ONE AND AN END AT THE OTHER
Line_6415	GETTING AN END OF THE TAPER
Line_6416	IT FELT KIND OF HARD BECAUSE NOBADY HAD THE EXACT RIGHT WEIGH TO MEASURE COMETS THIGH T
Line_6417	WAS UMBERTAN THAT WE FIT IT OUT THE CLOSEST GUESS WE COULD GET TO WITH OUR FREND
Line_6418	WE NEEDED TO LO IF THE CRAFT CABINET ME EXCEPT THE TENT RECOMMENDED
Line_6419	S IMPORT AND BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN IF THE ANSWER THE SAME ANSWER DIVISE THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT CORECT ANSWER
Line_6420	IT WAS A LITTLE HOT BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THAT IT WOULD BE THE SAME RESULT THAT IT CAME OUT DIFFERENTLY
Line_6421	A METER TAPE THIS HOUSE YOU CAN REALLY BECAUSE YOU PROVABLY BRO THE METERS STOOK IT AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO ME
Line_6422	BIG THE H ICE WAS BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING OR
Line_6423	THE FINGER HAS THE SAME SIZE AS ONE KILOMETER
Line_6424	IT GIVES US ARECRUNT TO D STUFF BECAUSE IT TURN FIT SO IMPORTANT THEN HELP M
Line_6425	HERE WON'T REALLY ANY BODY PART MEASUREMENTS THAT WERE THE SAME COULD WE DON'T GET TO FINISH MEASURING BEFORE WE FED FOR THUS
Line_6426	THE FU IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FLOOR UM
Line_6427	O HURT OTHERS ARE NO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BODY PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME SIZE EVERY BODY PARTS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_6428	YOU PROBABLY IS THE REFERENCE OF THE PINKIE HAS TWO AND THE STEAD OF ONE
Line_6429	YOU USE THE SMALLEST IN I'M NOT SHOURE WHAT IT'S CALLED
Line_6430	I GUESS I THINK IT KIND OF S LIKE SOMETHING UM NOT SHARE
Line_6431	YOU'LL SEE THEM WHEN THE LITTLE THING A MED STUCK UH WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO MEASURE SOMETHING
Line_6432	WE'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MASS TODAY AND MISSIS SHINES LASS
Line_6433	WE MEASURED THE MASS AND ESTIMATED IT THAT WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND WITH THE STAIEL TWAISE
Line_6434	S A STEEL TO FIGGER OUT THE WEIGHT
Line_6435	THAT THAT MAKES IT
Line_6436	WELL YOU COULD USE DIFFERENT REFERENCES TO MEASURE THEM
Line_6437	IT'S A PAPER CLIP
Line_6438	GROUP TWO HAS A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND GROUP ONE HAS A SMALLER PAPER CLIP
Line_6439	YOU COULD HAVE TH WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOU COULD HAVE TH EASE THE SAME SIZE INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6440	GROUP TWO HAS SMALLER SALTS GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER RECALTS
Line_6441	THAT'S ONE GRAM WE WORK BOS FOR MA TRYING HOW MUCH STUFF WEIGHT
Line_6442	WE MEASURED THE THINGS WE USED JUST SIENT
Line_6443	WELL YOU ARE EXACT ANSWER
Line_6444	I NOW THAT IT WEIGHS MORE THAN A SMALL ONE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE A MASS
Line_6445	THE LARGE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_6446	WELL BECAUSE THE METAL DISC IS DIETERMANED BY HOW MANY GRAMS THERE ARE IN
Line_6447	IT'S IN A PERFECTLY STRAHT LINE
Line_6448	WELL I'M NOT REALLY WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT
Line_6449	YEAH BECAUSE WE'RE BEASTRING WITH GRAMS WAY
Line_6450	ONE GRAM FIVE ONE GRAM FIVE IT IT TELLS YOU
Line_6451	THEIR BEING USED TO MEASURE THE MASS OF THE PIECE OF WOOD
Line_6452	THEY ALL RIGHT THE PENSAL IS TWO NICLES THAT MUST MEAN ITS TEN GRAMS
Line_6453	A METAL DISC WA IS A GRAM
Line_6454	THE TOY CAR WEIGHS SEVEN GRAMS
Line_6455	TWENTY BLUE
Line_6456	IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE EXCEPT THOY'RE GENING A NEED L OT WATER A
Line_6457	THE ORANGE WEIGHS MORE THAN ALL THE GRAM PIECES AND THE CUP
Line_6458	WELL OUR TEACHER HAD US TAKE AND SCIENCE TO TH SHE HAD US TAKE
Line_6459	THE ORANGE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_6460	IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND THE OTHER SIDE IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS TWO
Line_6461	A KILOGRAM IS TEN OF ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6462	M YOU NEED TO USE A SCAIL
Line_6463	TWO THREE AND EIGHT
Line_6464	WELL WE'VE BEEN ON WORK TO DAY WE WORKED WITH A SPONGE AND WATER
Line_6465	SPONGE ON THE LEFT IS DRY THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE SWAT AND THE SPONGE ON THE RIGHT SOKED AND THEY GREW AS THEY GOT RIGHT AND DREW DRY
Line_6466	WELL IT'S A SPUNGE THAT IS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET
Line_6467	IT'S A WET SPONGE WHICH MEANS IT HASN'T GROWN ON THE WAY TO SOK A SOKED SPONGE BUT IT IS STILL GETTING BIG TO STELL BIGGER THAN
Line_6468	IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOTALLY WAT AND IT'S YOU IT'S DRIPPING AND REALLY WA
Line_6469	WHEN IT'S ALL THE WEIGH WHEN IT'S LARGEST IT CAN GET
Line_6470	YOU CAN TAKE THE WET SPONGE YOU CAN USE A SPONGE AND USE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6471	THERE IS NO GRAMS IND THE CUP AND U NEED TO PUT GRAMS AND THE CUP SO UM
Line_6472	YOU USE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6473	SPUNGE IS FOR THREE GRAMS LONG
Line_6474	SPAN WEIGHT TO BEIKE GRAMS TO DOME
Line_6475	IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_6476	IT'S SIXTEEN GRAMS ONG IT'S SIX TEEN GRAMS AND A WEIGHT
Line_6477	YOU CAN IT'S YOU CAN MEASURE THE DIFFRACTS
Line_6478	SO YOU MEASURED THEM BOTH OUT AND THE ANSWERS THIRTEEN GRAMS WATER BECAUSE YOU TOOK THREE AWAY
Line_6479	IT CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_6480	YOU WERE TRYING TO PIE OUT THE DIFFERENCE
Line_6481	THAT WOULD PROB OF LA ONE PART AT A TIME
Line_6482	WELL ITS SORTA TELLS ME THAT I CAN KNOW HOW MUCH WAS
Line_6483	IT MAINLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT IN THE CUP
Line_6484	YOU GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME ARE BECAUSE THE GROUP ONE IS BIGGER AND GROUP TWO IS SMALL
Line_6485	IT'S A MIXTURE AVELITEOR
Line_6486	WELL WE CAN MEASURE DIFFERENT WATERS MASS OF WATERS OUT
Line_6487	WE'RE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER FROM THE CUP
Line_6488	SO THAT WE CAN UM
Line_6489	THE LITTLE SPINS ON METERS THING IS ONE HUNDRED ME METERS
Line_6490	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6491	I USE THEM AND COCKANG
Line_6492	IT'S FOR VALIUS WHICH IS A GROUP ONES FOR WHICH IS A MILL METERS UM
Line_6493	STUFF THE STUFF THAT WE NEAD TO MAR
Line_6494	I'M NOT SHUR
Line_6495	UM MILLA METERS
Line_6496	IT'S PUSHING THE WATER AND SIDES THRILL OUT THE FRUNT
Line_6497	YOU WOULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND M RATE HOW MANY IT WAS
Line_6498	THEY RAPPERES ON DIFFERENT NUMBERSFOR MILLIMETERS
Line_6499	HEY SHARED WATER
Line_6500	THAT WAS ABOUT CUP S OKAY HIKED
Line_6501	TER AY BE SE AND D THROUGH THAT A OR D
Line_6502	WELL I SALT OF
Line_6503	A SON CURRENT OR WHATEVER LITTLE SQARDY THING IS CUTE
Line_6504	THEY TELL YOU TO THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS AND YOU PULL THIS S COMERENER
Line_6505	ONE TWO THREE FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN EAT NIN TEN SO EACH ONE UM WA
Line_6506	EACH LINE PROCEED TO IT DIDN'T HAVE THE DARKER LINES THAT THEY
Line_6507	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6508	IT'S S THE MAGINUM THAT'S HALF OF ONE HUNDRED
Line_6509	I'M NOT SHURE
Line_6510	ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GAMES
Line_6511	OK ON THE BACK AND SEE WHAT THE VOLIUMS SAD
Line_6512	HOW MUCH THERE WAS FROM THE BOTTOM TLIME BE
Line_6513	EACH ONE IS FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_6514	THE VOLINUM MALS AND THE CAT
Line_6515	YOU YOU SHOULD MEASURE THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_6516	TWO HUNDRED MILL METERS OF WATER ARE FILLED WITH LESS SOLUTE
Line_6517	THEY'RE CONTAINERS
Line_6518	WO HUNDRED MALLLITOERS
Line_6519	THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIENCES BUT THEY S THE SAND OF THE WIRES
Line_6520	IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER TO DO IT
Line_6521	THAT THE SHAPE AND THE VOLIUM ARE ALWASE THE SAME THE VOLIUME AND DON'T MATTER BUT THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER DUS
Line_6522	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_6523	WITH THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN OVER THE CIRCUITS UM BLOCKING IT THAT STEEL CAN STICK
Line_6524	I CAN RELAX THE LINE
Line_6525	WELL ON THE THICKER PAPER IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT'S TO THICK BUT ON THE PAPER IT'S THEN SO IT CAN STICK
Line_6526	I DON'T KNOW
Line_6527	WITH THE LONG OF ER OBJECT IS A NAIL AND SO UM WHEN THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6528	I'VE BEEN DOING MOLTIPLCATION AND DIVISION
Line_6529	WEE WEARE UM WE WEARE DOING MEASURING AND THAT STUFF
Line_6530	I'M SORY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6531	YES UM MAINLY WAS THE WASHER
Line_6532	WHAT HOW TIGHT THE MOLECULES ARE MOLECULES ARE SORE
Line_6533	NO WE USED THE SCAIL
Line_6534	COUNTERWTES ARE THINGS THAT MAKE OTHER THINGS ON A SCAIL EVEN LIKE STRLIKE STRAHTE SIDE TO SIDE
Line_6535	I DON'T KNOW YOUR WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6536	BECAUSE METAL WEIGHES MORE THAN PLASTICK
Line_6537	IT WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_6538	BALANCE BECAUSE SOME TIMES YOU NOT RIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_6539	YES IF IT'S ON SCAIL
Line_6540	A PLASTIC CHIP AND PAPER CLIPS ARE ON A SCAIL AND CUPS AND THEY'RE EQUAL
Line_6541	WE'VE BEEN DOING THE VISION AND WEIGHING
Line_6542	HE PLASTIC CHIP THEN THE WOODEN CUB THEN THE METAL RING
Line_6543	WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
Line_6544	THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_6545	A THIS S ALL I THINK
Line_6546	UM YOU COULD UM GET UHM OR ROLY AND UM YOU IT ESTIMATE
Line_6547	TWENTY AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S IT
Line_6548	UM IT'S UH HOW Y OR IN SALCIES
Line_6549	UM BECAUSE WHEN IF YOU DO IT WHILE IT'S STILL MOVING YOU COULDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
Line_6550	YOU PLACE IT UNDER WATER CO AND THEN THE UM ALL C UP GOES UP OR DOWN
Line_6551	OWL UM HOW MUCH HE HOT OR COLD HOW HOT OR COLD THEY ARE IN SOLCIES
Line_6552	UM WE HAVE BEEN UM MEASURING VOLUTS UM AND WEIGHT YEAH
Line_6553	MARNEY I DON'T GET THAT
Line_6554	N THE AN THE GRAMS WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SPUNGE WOULD
Line_6555	Y IT THINKS THINKS FOR LETTING ME TEACH YOU BYE MARNEY
Line_6556	OH YEAH TODAY WE MEASURED HOW MUCH WATER A SPUNGEH CAN TAKE UP
Line_6557	WE USED GRAMS BECAUSE
Line_6558	I THINK THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT
Line_6559	THE METAL DISC WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6560	UM YEAH THAT'S SPACICQUE YEAH
Line_6561	YEAH WE HAD THAT IN OR CLASS AND THEN WE USED THEM
Line_6562	WELL THOSE LITTLE NUMBERS ON THIS SIDE AND YOU LEAD THE TEMPERATURE THERE
Line_6563	ONE HUNDRED DIGREES IT IS
Line_6564	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER AND STUFF LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6565	GRAMS ARE EASIER TO UNDER STAND
Line_6566	YOU CYOU COMPARE IT WITH THE NILE
Line_6567	UM WHAT WHAT STUFF E WHAT STUFF EL
Line_6568	AND TAND TEN GRAMS EQUALS ONE TEN BIG GRAM
Line_6569	YEOUE FIRST PUT IN THE ORANGE AND THEN YEOU
Line_6570	THE ORANGE WEIGHS A LOT MORE THAN THOSE GRAMS
Line_6571	FIVE TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6572	UM WHICH ONE WAS HOTTER AND WHICH ONE WAS COLDER
Line_6573	THE RO IS STICKING HIS FINGER AND CUP BE TO SEE IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_6574	IT MEANS THAT A IS UM IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM SEE AND THINK IS A TE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM BETH
Line_6575	WITCH ONE IS HOTTER
Line_6576	UM YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE UM THE TEMPERATURE OR YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR FINGER
Line_6577	YOU STICK A THERMOMETER AND UM THEN IF THEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS
Line_6578	WE WANT TO USE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_6579	UM I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_6580	YOU WOULD LOOK UM CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT TEMPERATURE IT WAS
Line_6581	ON SOME IT'S REALLY HOT AND ON SOME IT'S REALLY COLD
Line_6582	THE THERMOMETER IS
Line_6583	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE WORD FOR IT
Line_6584	IT'S THE ALCOWHOLE
Line_6585	THE THE I SWAHER I MEAN THE IS IT MOUNTS IN THE WATER AND THEN IT MAKES IT AND THEN THE ISE MAKES IT COLDER
Line_6586	AND IT'S GETTING COLDER
Line_6587	WE HAVE BEEN DOING LIKE WEIGHING THINGS
Line_6588	WE PUT IT IN ONE SIDE OF THE SCL AND THEN WE WE WEIGHTED TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS BY PUTING GRAM WEIGHTS ON THE OTHER SIDE
Line_6589	AND YOU CAN ADD MORE GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCE OR TAKE OUT GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_6590	WELL IT TAKES LIKE THE DISC THE METAL DISC IS BALANCED WITH THE GRAM WEIGHTS
Line_6591	WELL YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE A DIFFERENT WELL YOU CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LOT OF DIF
Line_6592	HINGS YOU CAN WATER AND YEAR IKE PRITY MUCH THE EASIEST ONES AND THE ONLY ONES THAT WE'VE DON
Line_6593	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGER OUT WHITCH WAS HOTTEST AND WHICH WAS COLDEST AND WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDAL
Line_6594	SHEOU'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_6595	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THEM SOME F THE CUPS ARE GOING TO BE COLDER THAN OTHERS
Line_6596	IT
Line_6597	WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT WANTS TO EXPAND IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS HOTTER
Line_6598	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
Line_6599	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURES LEG CAPASOULY AND MASSIS
Line_6600	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HON IT IS OR HOW COLD IT IS
Line_6601	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGGERUH WHICH WAS THE CORCE AND RICH EL THE MEDIUM AND WHICH WAS THE HOTTEST I MEAN WARMLEST
Line_6602	W IS IN SITTING ONE OF IS FINGERS INTO THE CUP B
Line_6603	ELL FIRST IT WAS A TIRES THEN THE DROP THE FIVE DIGRES THEN ENCULY RAN UP
Line_6604	UH UM SIBATION S RE
Line_6605	WELL OBSOBATION THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS AND MAKE GRAS AND TALK ABOUT THE THINGS AND YOU CAN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
Line_6606	I LIKE SCIENCE MUCH AND SCIENCE IT'S NOT A FAR AN SUBJECT
Line_6607	HUNDRED UH ONE HUNDRED DIGREESE IS BUBBLING POINT SO THE WATER WILL BE BUBBLING
Line_6608	OILING IS ILL AL HA
Line_6609	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPUNGCHES CAN OBSORBE
Line_6610	THE LE THE LEFT ONE IS DRY THE MIDDLE ONE IS WET AND THE RIGHT ONE IS SOKED
Line_6611	IT ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER
Line_6612	IT'S SORT OF CRACKLES
Line_6613	IT'S WET SO IT MOVE IT'S WET SO IT MOVES MORE ESALLY AND IT'S OBSORBED SOME WATER
Line_6614	E SPONGE HAS GOT BIGGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS HARD
Line_6615	THE WATER TRIPS OUT AND IT GETS IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
Line_6616	WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITH OUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET
Line_6617	THE SPUNCE HAS OBSORBED WIRE AND SO IT'S TIPING THE BALANCE SCAM
Line_6618	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BASE
Line_6619	THE SPOUNCE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE IT'S OBSORBING WATER
Line_6620	A GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONGE AND IT WAS EQUAL
Line_6621	WE HAVE MEASURED TEMPERATURE
Line_6622	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT OR HOW COLD THINGS ARE AND YOU CAN USE THERMOMETERS TO TELL
Line_6623	WHICH WAS THE COLDEST AND WHICH WAS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6624	WAS AND IF IT WAS THE COLDEST OR THE WARMEST
Line_6625	THE RO IS TESTING CUP BE WITH HIS FINGER
Line_6626	IT MEANS THAT SOME HAVE HIER DIGREES THAN OTHERS AND THIS ROW IS TRYING TO TELL
Line_6627	WHICH ONE IS COLDEST WARMEST AND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6628	AND LIQUIDS AND SOME SOLIDS AND MOST GASSES
Line_6629	MEASURED THE EXACT DIGREES AND HOW DIFFERENT ALL THE CLASSI MEASUREMENTS WEARE
Line_6630	Y SHOWS HOW MANY DIGREES THAT THE THING IT'S IN ARE
Line_6631	THEY SHOW HOW MANY DIGREES THE THING THAT THERE IN IS
Line_6632	WE CAN DUE SOUTH ES OR FAR AND HEIGHT THESE THERMOMETER SHOW SOLIIES
Line_6633	WE WERE CHECKING THE CHANGES AND TEMPERATURE EVERY MINUT
Line_6634	WE NOTICE SORT OF THE SAME DIGREES AND IT'S SORT OF ROD AFTER A FOU MINTS SLOWLY
Line_6635	THE IS CLIPS WILL MOUNT AND THE WATER WILL GET WARMER
Line_6636	IT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE ICE HUB IS FROSAN WATER SO IT'S COLD
Line_6637	I SEE FIFTEEN DIGREES DIFFERENT
Line_6638	AND RIGHT IT DOWN OF COURCE R
Line_6639	I SEE THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN I NOT I LOT I OUT AND THEN SLOWLY GOING UPWARD
Line_6640	UM AND JUST SILCKED UP OR THE WASHER THAT IT CAN HOLD
Line_6641	MEAN IT'S KIND OF BEN JUST SELKING UP WATER IT
Line_6642	UM HE AUM
Line_6643	I DON'T VALY KNOW WHAT THE SELLP SPONGE IS
Line_6644	THANXSE MY TY BYE
Line_6645	UM MA UM MAOLTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6646	WEE MEASURED HOW WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND SAW HOW COLD IT WAS
Line_6647	WE MEASURED HOW COLD IT WAS AND WITH THE THERMOMETER AND THE B WAS COLDEST
Line_6648	HOW COLD AND HOW HOT IT WAS
Line_6649	OKAY WEE WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD WITH THE WEIGHT WITH THE WEIGHT LAST WEAK
Line_6650	WE COULD USE ROLER AND MEASURE HOW HIY IT WENT UP TO
Line_6651	IT COULD TELL US HOW HI THE CUP CTHE CUP COULD HOLD WATER
Line_6652	CA THE VOLIUM OF LIQUID AND THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN
Line_6653	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_6654	HE VOLIUM IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND THE CAPACITY THE CAPACITY'S HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD PUT THE VOLIUM IS HOW MUCH IT'S HOLDING NOW
Line_6655	I COULD FILL IT UP TO THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLLITERS
Line_6656	WE COULD USE A SIRRENGE AND MEASURE HOW MUCH
Line_6657	WE COULD USE A CIRRAINGE TO MEASURE IT
Line_6658	I DID THINGS

Line_0	I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CONNETIC ENERGES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DIVISE OR LIGHT BULBS SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHO YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK I NEVER MIND
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_7	CONNETIC ENERGY AND AN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPED AROUND THE LIKE BIT
Line_10	TONE NEG TE OF A TE UM
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE T SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING THE UP OF COLE
Line_14	EARRY OS THE MITS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULS CIRCUIT
Line_16	THIS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT THE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES BASING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THIS THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY OBSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE IS THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORBE ENERGY FROM THE SUM AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CHELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPNING IS IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGE
Line_25	WE METAL OR A COPER OUR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUMKIE STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING TOUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE WERE I'S NOT RUDNING BECAUSE THE PAPE THE S THE WELL THE STICK IS NOT MEAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT A METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT WE JUST ASTABLISHED IN IT
Line_30	MAD F MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THAN NADE NEADS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE ING MADE OF METL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	ILLITERS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL BA TALL
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CON CONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE NOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND N SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAXIS IE
Line_38	THE WICKH WHICH IS THE THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SCEND LIKE ANYTHING
Line_40	IS BEARNING AND FLAMING AND
Line_41	UM USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WN GOING ON A HITCH CK BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	UM THUST PRODUCING FF GIVING ET ENERGY AND THE SOUNDIS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HEARE SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT
Line_44	IT ALL IS WALKING AND NEADING ENERGY WHICH IS A KIND OF IMPASCSIBLE BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	WILL BEARN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINKUN LESS IT IS THE SOLAR POWER CAL
Line_47	IT WILL COMPUT THE SUN TO THE SOLAR POWNDOR TO THE SOLAR ENERGY D CELL AND IT WILL GOSTY THAT TRANSERING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT G
Line_48	OAY TOM WE SIP THIS
Line_49	NON REUSABLE
Line_50	IT IS ONLY OUH ONE TIME USE AND COAL IS JUST AND COALL IT'S IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONG TIME
Line_51	THEEARY WILL NOT GETING YEAI I AM NOT
Line_52	H THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	TON'T GETS AND H WHEL ON'T GET
Line_54	I OLD THINKTHAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICE THAT HIS THAT IT IS A LIMCUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT'S GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S VERY BADD IT CAN'T
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IT IS HEIRELY COMPROCATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RADICAL WAY
Line_59	RIER OR BE EAR CAND COMPLUCATE AH
Line_60	THAT'S I DO NOT NOW FER
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	OKAY I DON'T KNOWTHE PATHS ARE GOING IN T
Line_65	IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
Line_66	EO NO AS
Line_67	NOW
Line_68	I AGMR BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CICUIT
Line_70	ECAUSE THE NEAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPERCONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	UH I AN DON'T KNO
Line_73	UM SOARY AND BISY AND I DON'T WEIGH T HAVE TIME FOR
Line_74	I'M SOURT OF BISY REALLY BISY YEAT
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE LEST
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINIM WHITCH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS ALUMINIM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END

Line_263	THEY'RE COMPONENTS AND A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRE
Line_264	THES HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWERS
Line_265	IF THE D CELL ORE NT THEY'RE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EAVINENCE OF THE ENERGY TRAMNS OR ERAND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILLMANT AND THEY'RE GETS SO HOT THAT IT W'ILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB

Line_279	WEELL WAT IF YOU FLIPT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULBBLS STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FILIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT PINT WOULD NOT GET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN ITOFF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	HINCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT UM SO THAT IT SHOWES THAT THE MOTION IS HAPINING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THE BATHE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSE FER ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS SPEING TRANSFERD THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT PAINS
Line_289	RY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	IT STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT PINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTORWILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	THE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNESE ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUN LIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR SHEL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLIPK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	MOTOR STOPS RUNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR FOR TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS TBECAUSE NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	MIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SUMMER CONDUCTORS SUMMER INSULATOR
Line_306	ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE UM THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UM IF YOU PUT AN INSULLATORUM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE SPOPSICAL STIT DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	INSULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS TRY TO ACT LIKE AND LIKE A BRICK WALL ALOWING NOW ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY

Line_330	THEY WILL PULLUTH THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CREALLY SMOLWG
Line_331	THEY POLLTHE ERTH LUSL OR PANELS DO NOT PULL UP THE ERTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLO
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUME DOS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THES CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT THERE IS NOT ENOFF ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE IS MORE POWER TO LET THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FASCE THE THE SAME POLARY
Line_344	YOU PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSIT
Line_345	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WAIGSE AND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEN FLOWS IN TWO WAIGSE INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S ON PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULB
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED AND THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS RIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BAWND THEN THE YEENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY N ND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE OF THES
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THERE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BERRUNS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF TUM TH THE FILLIMENS IS BURNED UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALLIF THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IND ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILLIMENT IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TWO
Line_368	A FILIMENT BRATES AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN THE BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW STOPS
Line_370	THE DI FILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	E PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEPS WORK IT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURND OUT SO YOU CAN EASALLY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAR AND AND IT STAYS ON
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BERNCT WHICH IS LIKE AND OPEN
Line_375	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND PATHWAYS
Line_376	WELL UM
Line_377	T FILLIMEN BROK SO UM SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S A SERY
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILLMIT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRCUIT LIKE AN OPEN SWIT
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARND HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THEN NAIL BECAUSE IT'S ETHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	THA MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON A NAIL S STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHITCH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	IOAE SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NOW IRON IN IT ORAN AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DAS
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOFTHING BECAUSE IT IT'S IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOS
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL ONEIT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	I THINK IT'S ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENE TO WHAT HAPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A WRACK
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPELE EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGENST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGENST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THE BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSED TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPAESS SHOWING NORTH ON THE ERTH
Line_402	SOMEONE USING A COMPRESS TO FU WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FALLWS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTED METAL THAT IS STEEP INSIDE THE ERTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRO
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPOST POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MO
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENUGF TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHITCH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTTHING BECAUSE IT'S TO THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE MAGNET PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSE FOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING TH REEAN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZES EVERYTHING LAS A TEMPORRARY MAGNET
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISOM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISOM IS TRANSFERING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BREAKING WITH WEIGHT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN STAF
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENUFF ATTRACTION FORCE BECAUSE IT IS TO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AWAY
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKANS THE MAGNETIC
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	AD IT MAKES THE FORCE WEA
Line_427	WELL THE FORCE OF MAGNETISUM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKEANS THE FORCE BECAUSE OFA DISSTA
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACE
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAKE THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WROP THE CORD WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZSES THE COLE
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETING TOT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHITCH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAIN IGE BECAUSE ELECTROMAGNETS USE A TON OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE THE SWITCH MAKES SHURE OF IT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LASST FOREVER
Line_438	IT MAGNETISES THE COAL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COIL TO MAGNETISE IT
Line_440	THE THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWINCHROUGH THAT COILETO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE WEARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	IT HAVE TO BE RAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETISE THE RIVE
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	BOTH THESE ARE WIYE ARES
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEUM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB FLIGHE
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEUM
Line_448	IT IS A SORD
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGTYY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	W THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	BUT THE WIRES ARE A PATHERAY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
Line_455	I JUST CARRY ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY LIGHT AN THESE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE BULB LIGHT
Line_458	ITH
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	TIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_461	IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS TA BUM ON IT
Line_462	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND  GOES TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY R PROENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRI THE FLOW GOES THE OER WAY
Line_466	UH JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOUS
Line_467	CTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DING WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AN I NO THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEAIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES AND THE SHAIN IN ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	I DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH IND THIS PIXTURE IS AND
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STUPS SPINING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT 'S THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR SIT'S RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL LOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THEY VANCHING ANY AD
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UMWHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I CRICK ON IT O GAC
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR STOP THE MOTOR THRTS SPINNING
Line_492	E SOLAR SALT DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR IT WILL NOT RA
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STAPS RUNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR STAND
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WEE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANELS
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS STUDYING
Line_498	THE NAILE
Line_499	THE MOTOR IT KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPER CLIP BRIGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPICAL STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	UM MAL
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSED I SOW IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYSE METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WEEVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	I THINK THAT UM THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE MAX THE WAX IS MOUNTED
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAXIS NO
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT HAIN
Line_517	I SEE A FLAME
Line_518	ITS IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	UM SOMEONE IS DRUMING
Line_520	SHEE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEARE IT UM YEA
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHEE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WA
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFFLD
Line_525	THERE GETS THERE GETS POLUTED
Line_526	THEE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	HOKAY
Line_528	UHM THE SOLAR STHE TEREB NOSE
Line_529	STUFF
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NON RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THER THE AIRN WILL BE POLLUTDED
Line_532	UM THE COAL GASSPROLUTS THE AIR
Line_533	COL AN GASS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	UM THE ELECTRICITY IS GLOWING AND IT IS CLOS
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN STOP
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND A STR CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULB
Line_541	YOUR ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_542	ELUME DOT THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY S HELP THE ELECTRICITY FLO
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERYW DO
Line_544	ONE
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WE'LL MEAN MORE WIRES
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET RIGHT TO
Line_547	THE LIGHTS OT
Line_548	YEAH THATS THOSE RIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT TO ANIDHES
Line_549	I SEE THAT
Line_550	THEY HOW YOU AD THE POUNIFIS LADY IN THE WL
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	ET
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULB WILL WE BIGED ER
Line_556	BOISE GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THECT THE POSITIVE MOUNT THAT IRE S NOT
Line_557	THAT IS VALY BECAUSE IT RACTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES AN THROUGH THE THYYAND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE ELHEGLIS REAN
Line_559	THEERE ARE TO PATH W
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAY
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THE VERY QUIL
Line_562	NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE  HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_563	THEY ARE A BRIY TIN
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVEANLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IF I DOESN'T GO TRA THO  ONLY GOES ON TY E E
Line_565	UM THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATH WAY
Line_566	I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RI EA
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_570	THEY THERE ARE TWO LIGHNS IN THEME
Line_571	THERE ARE IS ON BULLTHERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BLB
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S ORM PATHWAY THERE TWO PALTH WAY
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR OM CAFFWAY
Line_574	THEY IRE THEIR ON POWNER
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DAM
Line_576	M I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOM BRIGHT TA
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE BRY TO YOU  THE DIST
Line_578	U THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY YOU HA
Line_579	THEY ARRE ELECTRI FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOWING
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSI HAVE EN OUT THROUGH THE
Line_582	THE IT JUST GOWING AND THROUGH THE POSCI 'S AND OUT THROUGH THE TS
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOMES OUT THG WITH THAT NB
Line_584	I DID NOT SHARE YOU SO PLDESE IT AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TO WHOLL PP THE WAIGHST AND THEY ARE JU
Line_586	THEERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_587	IT LAFTS THE
Line_588	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BEURNING OUT QUICK BE
Line_590	UH THE TOP ONES ARE RIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM UMS
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE WAN
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHAR A PATHWAY AND A D CELL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND BOTH OF THM
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEAD A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE Y SO WE NEAD THE POARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SEARY IS A CIRCUIT
Line_596	AM GODED HOW ARE ARE YOUH MY PUL LADD
Line_597	I FOUND OUT HAMAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND THE TRELLIX THING S OBVIAUSLY BU'S MORE AND SA
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE REFREL WEIGH TALL
Line_600	ECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETICK
Line_601	THE NAIL FN IS STICKING ONTO THE MAGNETT
Line_602	IT ANDS MADE OF INOT
Line_603	WOD YEAON PLASTICK YEAH
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS AND EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLO DOESN'T HAVE NE IRON AND STEEL ON IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE NDY IRON OR STEEL AND IT SO IT DOES NOT A CHAP
Line_607	THEY BOLBE ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEELYOU THINK THAT
Line_608	THEY ARE BL MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_610	I TOLD OU I MAGNET STICK TO IRONON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE PUT IS STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL R THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO THO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT MY HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I RIGHT TO DAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FIN HA ARYOU
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COPEES
Line_623	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IFS BECAUSE UM IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY REPE
Line_628	THE SAME SIDZE TEIRE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH ANR SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPESS AND IT IS A NOITHE AND THE SOUTH SAME ON ERTH AND NOISEFLL AN A SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WEE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEARE WHAT YOU JUST SAD
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASET
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRENTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEED CONS STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THEN YOU CAN NOT TH WILLDON'T LIKE J
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL N A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	SI DON'T KNOW
Line_642	ELL IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS INT THE NAIL I MEAN IT IS A'T THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BO STUFF MEANS THAT IT HAS
Line_646	I TO NOT NO
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	IVE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING AABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PE
Line_650	THE THERE ISAN'T ENUFF COW
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON B SIDE THEN THE END MA
Line_652	THERES ARE WASHER NO THEY'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO IP TO THE B CUP
Line_654	UM THAT YOU CAN IPART THE SPACES
Line_655	IT MES THE AMAGNET FORCE ME WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENDS THE FORICED
Line_657	I DO NOT OW
Line_658	IL PUSH AND PUSHOR RA
Line_659	YOU PUT SPACE THEAR
Line_660	ITS BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND WAH
Line_662	WELL IT MAKES T FORCE OF THE MAGNET TIT FOW S WEAKER
Line_663	GOUD
Line_664	WEAIVE AND SAN HOW IT WILL RRIVETS AND PICK UP WASHERS
Line_665	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WL UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STES
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE WOODS SHOW FOW HERE
Line_671	IT'S NOWALK
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MANE
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTRO MAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	THERE IS ALSS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	THATS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RAVIT
Line_676	OR ELEC TRICK ELECTRICITY AND THE STEEL RIVER MAKE A MAGN AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_677	UM I CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THIN AND IT CAN PICKLE STUFF
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT JIS ROLES THE STEEL MRCUEIT
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN'T PICK UP ANDY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BIL AND TIME
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN NOWASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN BTASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE  ELECTRICITY TO MAKE A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_687	THEY POPERCLUM
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRES WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM THE STEEL
Line_691	THAT HAD TO BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEAT OP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SORCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU'RE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CATHAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK
Line_697	WITH OUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOOULD  NOT LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_698	IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRYE  ELECTRICITY FROM  THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE M WHAT YO MADE ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND  AND OF THEM
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP AS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRTE ELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WHEN IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEVING IT TO LIGHT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVER REALLY STOPS IT JUST CEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE LU BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS ER BULBS REP THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO IC THE ELECTRICITY FLOWES FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	I THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTL NOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR A TA ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	L RERENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTILL YOU DISTATCH TO ONE F THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WON'T BE ABLS FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BASE CIRCLES SO A DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND KNO MATER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DOUN ANYTHING NBUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINING AND THEN MATHE ENERGY FROM THE EXTR ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATE
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FOULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR END BACK TO THE BATTERY L THE ENERGY DOESNOT FLOW A THE WAY
Line_714	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING THE SPAIN AND THEN OF COURCE THE EXTR ENERGY GOES IT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WILL LEARN ABOUT YESTER
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCHIT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE BO
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY CAN WORK THE SUNES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY THATS YOU CAN U
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WER IT WOULD NOT HEARE AND THEDISTHE SUNS
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOU BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PAINEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET  UMAH
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREW
Line_727	ONE IS A SCREW IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PA PAPER CLIP IS COMPLEATING THIS CIRCUICUIT
Line_729	ECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRAVE STICK IS MAKING DIFFERENT STEEL OPAN
Line_731	THE CRAPED STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT OBSORBES ALLIVIT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL AND IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR WHELL METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS SO IT DOES NOT COM OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT NECTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT'S STEEL THOT COMPLETEND
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARALL PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	THE FARABELL THE LIGHT BULBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT IT'S A SCENTUM SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A CLCOMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	CAS THE THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR ON PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLCATEDG BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY GOING THE DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GETING ITS ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOOULD UM CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	IT COMES FROM THE POMRANT ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIE NEGATIVE SIDE AND WEIGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING THE D CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT ES I CAN BULB ON THE OTHER
Line_751	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEM SELVES THATTARTO EVSED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHEARE A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS THAT ARE TO HELP USE SOME OF THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
Line_753	I THINK I PARALLEL A VERYLEL AND PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING A
Line_754	THEUH GOOD
Line_755	THEY THEY'RE NARALLY USED A CRISMEC TO DECORATE MH TREES AND HAPES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRING IS TURN OUT DIPENDING ON WHAT ITS
Line_758	A PARALL A PARALLEL CICIT
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF  BULB GOES OUT THE WHOLE LIGHT GOES THE WHOLE THING GOES OUTNO HAVE TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WHENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB TURNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULBS WENT OUT IN THE MIDDL AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROCKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL  CBOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE UER BULBS SAY H THOT ONES STEEL ANG WHEN THT TURNS OUT UNLESS ANDOTHER IS TURINING
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEY'RE GOING AND AEIN AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE RESTOOMS THAYWA
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILLMA ND THE FILL IND THE BULB WITH THE FILLEMID BROKIN
Line_769	THE ELIMENT IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT'S FLOWING
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RAING THE BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR COLEAR THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THTHE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YEARON COPER AND SOME OTHER CINDS OF METAL
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL SCUR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK IS NON EVEN
Line_777	STEEL  IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE
Line_778	I HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCKIS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULES IT TO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TEN AND THE OTHER ONE'S MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE ION
Line_783	IT WILL STICK ASE IT HAS TRACES OF LTIRON
Line_784	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS TO GRY THE BROWN GREY ROCK TON'T SIDE THAT YOU MEN THE BLACK RC
Line_785	IT REALL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR A STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIP
Line_786	IS IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST REAN FORCT
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WHILL OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD STAP ATTRACTING AND THEY WOULD REAP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PLUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE THE CAN COMEL THE MAGNETS IT JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OPERCIS ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES REPEL
Line_791	GOING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE IS SING COMPESS TO SEE WHICH HE IS GOING IT RIGHT NOW SHE 'S GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE ERTH NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT SIKS FOR MAGNETS EVAND WHATD HAVANDS WHEN THEY INTORRACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STROYNG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECT
Line_797	MAGNETISOM ONLY HAS A CERTAN RANGE SO IF IT'S BE ON THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TWO IT'S TWO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE MOTOR TAKES STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM THAT  ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	SO IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISOM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW WAND IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY ATHEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONES
Line_802	IT'S  IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL WHEN IT COMES OFF ND THE NAIL STOP BEING AE MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU  WHEN YOU DRAKE  THE MAGNET PROFFIT STOPS ING A MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING OFF THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISOM
Line_807	TAKE THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	EA MAGNETISM THEYRE
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SOLET STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	ESY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT O THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP FRO THROUGH SUCH STICK TSTACK
Line_814	LEALING HOW STRONG THE FORCIF MAGNETISOM IS
Line_815	A BAGIT
Line_816	THERE IS ONLY A CIRTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISOM BRAKES BECAUSE IT'S TWO STRONG TO AVE A WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY ADD A OTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDDER TO GET C THE MAGNETISM S WEAKER CREK THH THAT TO RVTHE SPACERS
Line_819	IMUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIGHT SCO
Line_820	THE BOR FRITS SAWH MAGNET TO DE CELLBH
Line_821	I GNOT IS UM
Line_822	MAKES ITS WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'R FARTHER AWAY
Line_823	BULLIDS
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DCREASES IT
Line_826	YUH MAKES THE MAGNETIC CPUL WEAKER
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BRAKES
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT IT STOPS BING ELECTRELECTRIFFIDE AND THE MAGNETISM IT IT DISAPERES
Line_831	THR'S A D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH IS RIVET AHTHE WIRES AND THEN THERE 'S THE CIRCUIT ORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE TETHE STEELL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE METAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU WRAPID AROUND THE STRONGER THE  MAGNETISM GET
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE POWERING A MOTOR IS ONLY IT HAS TO BE FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND IN CIRCLES SOOIT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH ESALLY CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CANT FLOW UND IT CARENT BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED D SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIIDE  AND MAGNEPIDE
Line_840	THE SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT MAGNETED UP TO THI THE RIVET
Line_842	A ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETISES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURNIN ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY AND  MAGNETISOM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AND STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THE IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO  MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND AE SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	IT MEAN
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THERE CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITEVE N AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPTD THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINGING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOSOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET T THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THE PINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES UND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCIT
Line_864	THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SMAL
Line_865	THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TWO MARNY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEMSO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	THE ENERGY WON'T THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VISE OCA
Line_875	I AM WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_877	IT IS THE CANDLE WIS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASAN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING BECAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKET
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE A RUM BUHM BUM BUHM BUHM UM
Line_883	THE APPLES THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DILITSHIAS
Line_884	THERE WOULD BEE SMELCK OR STEEM
Line_885	IT GETS FOLGY OR SMOKY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP MEY
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AR IVE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT IT WOULD POLLUT THE AAR
Line_889	I'M NOT SHURE BECAUSE YO HELP MY WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_894	I'M SARY UM THERE'S ONE D CELL AND TWO BULB
Line_895	IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT  GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TOGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	IT'S FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UMIGOS DO NOT GET THE CONCEPT
Line_900	UH UM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK ND
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THEY IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE BASE END CASING THEN IT'S THERE OCAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT CAH
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO ANDY ONES THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRE
Line_905	THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE ITH MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY WEARE THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	DS IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES  O FOOT IT STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METTALLE
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO MEEY
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE A POWEN
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THAT IT'S NORTH THE SOUTH OR SOUTH THE NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVETATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXTEPT FOR THE BOTM THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FOURCE OF THE WERLD
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPRESS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS TICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE ANDTHEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHER
Line_930	IT IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY THIN THEN IT SHAL GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY THICK THEN IT CANT
Line_932	UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSE ENUFF SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	RS UM THERE 'S A PATHWAY FOR THE
Line_935	THE NAIL WIS PICKING UP UM THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	IT TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS UM TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	BECAUSE M THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHELL THE NAIL IS ON THAT ITS ONLY NO ALL THE MAGNETS ON IT
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFERING INTO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISOM IS TRANSFERING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE'E WEREN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER RBECAUSE IT'S
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUFF ATTRACTION IT'S TWO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WHALL WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROK THE MAGNETIC
Line_947	THERE ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FOR SWEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SICX PACERS THEERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER L CUICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FOUR SWEAKER AND THERE'S MORE SPACE THAND BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TO MUCH IT BROK THE FORCED
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LO BEAKKERR
Line_952	YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MAIKES THE FORCE WEAK ER THE FORCE AND BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU CAN FIND HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT H
Line_956	I SEE CANDLEI THICK
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SHERE REALLY WHAT'S HAPNING
Line_958	THAT IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	THE FIRE BEURNING IS PROUF THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO RE FRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRIGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUTO METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OT STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRINGH
Line_964	REFRIGERATE DUS THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON AN POSIABLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS U STEEL NAIL WAS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THERERE BOTH MADE AS STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WIGHT ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PRY HAW PR HAS LIKE METAL ON THE OUT SIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INS SIDE
Line_971	THE IRON IN IT OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNE
Line_974	IVE BEEN LOWNING ABOUT HOW  CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT UP  LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THERE'S A WASHERE A BATTERYE LIGHT
Line_976	WAISHIERE BATTERY AND
Line_977	THE WIRES THEY THEY BRAKE AL ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FORM AND OTHER UM SO
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WAISERE UM UM CARIL
Line_980	IT PROVIDES HOW THE U
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKE A
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_983	IT WILL SHUT OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL M M
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CAPAALL ELECTRICITY SO  THE LIGHT BULB CAND LG
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITIES HOL  BATTERIES CAN THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECEIVE THE O LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE ENERGY FROM THE
Line_988	IT'S FLOWRING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND
Line_989	THE POINT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLULLIND OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS POSUM THE ELECTRICIT
Line_991	IT SLIPED OVER IT SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU CLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BA
Line_994	LHET YOU HAVETO HAVE ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BUL
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULB LIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BIG BY UM HA D CELL
Line_997	UTHE ELECTRICITY IS BREAKING BOT TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY DAUS TO BREATE THE BATTERY BRINGS E ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR FROM THE WAL
Line_999	CANY REPETED  IH
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PATURE IS SO LIKE IT BUNT IT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTOR STUTS UM SPINING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLO OPEN
Line_1003	I NOTICE THAT UM THE UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM IT SPIENS ANDU
Line_1004	IT CAN YOU REPEE THAT
Line_1005	UH IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE MOTOR GET BUT WHEN IY CLOSED I IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T MANS  IT DOESN'T MAKE ELECTRICITY UM FLOW UP TO THE MOTOR MY CRA
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GGON OUT SIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLAR POWNDOR IS CONLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WAIRS TO THE MOTOR SO HAT THE MOTOR CAN
Line_1009	ONE BRIN ELECTRICITY INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIC
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPANS THAT
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO COMPLETE TE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SPINING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE METALE PUM
Line_1013	U I DON'T KNOW
Line_1014	
Line_1015	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS AE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARNTS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	WE'RE JTIND BIYVE MORNY O IT JUT'SE THAT YOU HAN A
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	I DON'T DYOU ASC MEY ABOUT  HOW I'M FIELING

Line_1021	WIRES D CELL AND LIGHT BUBBLB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD YOU LLY GIO
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LARNING ABOUT HOW UM LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND UM PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND OER ELEC TROIS AND IT HAVS L
Line_1026	I SEE OF THE MIDLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELING CLUMTHE  FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	MI ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DON'T HOWM LIKE ANDYTHING YOU JUST WHAT
Line_1029	I CAN SEE THAT THE KHE ENERGY IS PUING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAHYE
Line_1030	A YOU MAY PIE DOWN AGIN
Line_1031	WHE UM ACTUALLY DOING PERTY GOD
Line_1032	UH WE'VE BEEN DOING UM POWER
Line_1033	IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOTS  ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UHT CAN YOU BE PICKED OUT AGAIN
Line_1036	CAN YOU PICKE UP LIESE
Line_1037	THERE HAS TLREE UM U
Line_1038	THE PULBS ARE GETING DAMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU HAVE MORE D CELLS THEN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AS THE TIME YOU ADD MORE D CELL
Line_1040	UM ONE BATTERYONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHERAND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU HAVE A POAGE SIDE AND THA NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECT TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE I HAME A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUITS
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NO
Line_1047	IT
Line_1048	IT'S AIT'S JUST THE USCE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	BOKAY UM WON'T WILL DON
Line_1050	THEY SCIRVE YOU LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO LIGHT
Line_1051	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THEMINES SINE
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWS IN THE UM PLUSS STHINE AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINESI
Line_1055	MOLECULES OR ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE METTAL BULBS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKAY HAS UN FINE
Line_1057	THE MINRES SINE
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MARNEY
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T STAR IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	ETHER WAY YOU CLICK ONE WIR OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT T
Line_1062	I WAS BILDING A CIRCUIT STEEL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND INTO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND T IT IS ON AND THETHE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NO RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT MEXED TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S A BULBIT'S THE METAL AND T IT'S LIKE ELECTRIC FING TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	IT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I I CLICKED IT IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE IS THE FLAG STP SHLOWING IT'S AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEXIGOMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE U WHAT CLOSE NAME
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATLE AND THEY AND THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANELE
Line_1078	IT WON'T SCEARVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S ON
Line_1080	IT TS T'S OFF IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY AND THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND THEN TO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOFTHING IS HAPUNING
Line_1084	YOU TWO MARNEY STE YOU LATER HAVE A GOOD DIE TWO BYE
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
Line_1087	ELECTRIC UM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I SAT THAT IT WOULD WORK
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM Y HAVE BEEN REALLY BEEN DOING ALUH JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT ON'T IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTICK IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS BOOD AE THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THEIR CONDUCTORS ARE  THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTORS STARED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND A SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE L ENERGY IT'S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE W AND TO PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE THE STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULD'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMMING IN THE THE PLASTICK AND IT'S SON
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALLK SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTON
Line_1111	BAPPLES
Line_1112	THE FEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE'ARE BEING EK NDU E
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE AIR HOT AND SMOK COMES S BIGER
Line_1115	THE SOLARD PANELE
Line_1116	GASS BOING WINDMILS SOLID ADNELES
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BOTH STRE ENERGY
Line_1118	TEOYR BOTH HAVE ENERGY IN UM AND BOTH STIRVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BOTH ARE COUAL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SCERVE ENERGY THEY JUST GIVABOUT SMOLK AND THE GASS MAKES THE CARM
Line_1121	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLID PANNEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GASS DOESNRT
Line_1123	THEY SEARVED THAT SMILK ANMALBIE AND THREE
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE FLAT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IS LIGHTING UPT
Line_1127	THEY ARE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILLIMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW EANYWEIRE JUST WHER ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	ANDIF IT'S ONLY METAL IT 'LL WORK LIKE A SWITCH ON THE CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	UH IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET MECER
Line_1134	THEY BULLE THEY ONE GETS BRIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FASING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN I CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLIPED IT AGAIN THEY STOPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FACSING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	M I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF STUFF AND MAGNETS
Line_1140	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONSEARNING EMERGY
Line_1143	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE IT IT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FIL MANT
Line_1145	UM I WEALL KNO
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING UM GOW THROUGH THE BATTERY AS U MEN THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYSE
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON SIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FOR WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WEE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT UH AN IN COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRE
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DED
Line_1160	STRINGS  LIGHTS RE I DON'T REAL IN THEM
Line_1161	IT'S TRNO LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE B THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DINE
Line_1163	WIRES AND A BATTERY AND
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE U NORML CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WRITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DING
Line_1166	THE FILLIMENT DIDE
Line_1167	THE FILLMENT DIDE ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILMAN DIZES AND THE RIGHT AND THE WIGHT
Line_1169	A FIELM IS DING ON THE BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CONDESSENT CIRCUITS AND I CAN REMEMBER THE REST
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NO THE BATTERY THE FILLMENT ISN'T DOING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPENS IS THE FILMT BREAKES N THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GRAY AND IT STOPS M
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINES SIGNE AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AN IN COMPLEATE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	H THE FILLIMAT IS DING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT'S
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CONDESS AND CIRCUITS A MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW YOU
Line_1180	IVE BEAN WEELL  DON'T OT LAFF MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH SO THERE GON HAVE TO BE UPSTI SO THET IKE CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE TRACTING TO THE FRIDGEH
Line_1183	BECAUSE IT'S STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	WORM THE MAGNETS STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WOOD IS BECAUSE ITS
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPER NAIL AMP DOEST
Line_1187	BECAUS BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOODOES NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METL OR COPPER OR STEEL THE FIT WILL FIT IS AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS ALMETUMS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TOMES
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	TIMSTIN
Line_1198	THESE RE MAGNET THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNET THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY AN THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURND THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT DSE STOPS AND IT DULS FALL AND IT DULS FUL
Line_1205	NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEM TO BILLD UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED TO HAVE ALL THE SOPLIZE I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETSTHREE WIRES AND A BAT
Line_1209	IT GES FULE
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIVE
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVETS STOPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPS AND THE MAGNETS
Line_1212	U MATOLTIRENT
Line_1213	OPEN MEAN CLOSED
Line_1214	THE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNETS BY THE RIVET
Line_1215	ELECTRIC ITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGJICK
Line_1217	YNOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	RAVAND MIRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BTO N MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB BUL
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS LTHE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE A TURNEL
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HUOKED TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GOING THROUG
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1226	AT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE WHAT'S REATS THE POWER COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THIS  D CELL TOWARDS THE NE THE POSITHE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE DTHE BLUE DOTS RPREN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE
Line_1231	I WAS APSANT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PARALLS AND HOWR A SOLAR PANEL ON AND DING RIZIN HEET AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR AND MATERIAAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICE THAT ALL THE PIECLS ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	ININSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEOS  THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTICK AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS ANDTER INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS CONDUCTO
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOES IT WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRIC
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYSE METAL AND ELAND ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYSE FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORKAND WITH THOUT ENERGY IT NOFTHING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS TAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS
Line_1242	YEAH DYOU HERE LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKL AND TYPE OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BEARNING
Line_1245	WHEN WHEN THE HANDS POUWED ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EATCH HIS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FODS SO SHE CAN CEEP ON WAHE
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEARE NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRLS EATING AND JUST GIVING HER ENERGY SOCHE CAN CKEEP ON WALER
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTS THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PUTS THE AIR THE AIR GETS ALL DIRTY AND NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO BREATH IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKY
Line_1252	THEY ARE SMLAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STOR IT
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COR SOMMORE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BEURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COL AND GLASS WILL POLLUTE THEIRE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BEURN THE
Line_1255	COAL AND GASS WOULD HAVE A BADD EFECT ON THE VIRONMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BADD FOR PEOPLE TO BR
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES ARE THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	THE ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT CIRCULLATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FOR THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVMENT ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE WARE
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1262	THE OTS MOVING REPRENS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT ITS CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE RE IS ONE PATH THE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIESCCET
Line_1264	THE ONE WI
Line_1265	BYE MORNT
Line_1266	FARY WELL
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE IS TWISCE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOW GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TO DIFFERENT PATHWAY
Line_1274	THE END IN THE BATTERY WEIRE ELECTRICITY LEEIDES IT JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING T THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE CI OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB AND GOES INTO THE POSITIV
Line_1276	I NOTICE THAT THEI TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB INSO A THE OTHER ONES
Line_1277	I US HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BUB WIRES AND CAP WIRES ANDAL AND A BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY RIGHT THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOARCE IS THE SAME THING
Line_1281	WELL IT'S A SAME THING
Line_1282	AKE
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHIGHT DECES
Line_1284	WELL THEY  LIGED UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THERE IS WY THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT BUB AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF FLINK GOIGHT OVL
Line_1286	CAN D SEEL THIN AGAIN
Line_1287	UMIT IS GOING TO LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING LIKE THE SAME
Line_1289	THEY ARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENTLY
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST IE AND THEN IT TURNES ST ELLOW SWITURNE
Line_1291	ILOOK AT SCNIC STUF
Line_1292	WE HAVS BEANON DOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GO
Line_1293	WELL THE UHM GREAY SCHEEK IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATT
Line_1294	IT IS UL BECAUSE MOTOR THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLIGHT MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LAIKE IT MOVES LIKE AROUND ANDER
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DNO THAT
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE IT ENERGY FROM THE BATTE
Line_1300	THE THE FLAG MO
Line_1301	THE FLA TAIRS MOVING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN INST THE FLAIG WILL STUP
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH HIT'S E WIRE UM THE FLAG STARENE
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG STARNE
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T D IT YT
Line_1306	THE GREY PECE WHEN IT'S SUNY
Line_1307	WELL  HA CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU CLIP THE S
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVIN
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS OCKING THE FLAG STUPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UM
Line_1312	SEE THE FLAG MMEAIN
Line_1313	THE CITHE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTE
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCHH IS TOUCHING THE WIRE SO LESS MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THEA UM WIRES AND THE SWITC
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSED
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE O S THE STICK
Line_1319	IT IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	OH I DON'T OANLY KNOW BECAUSE I AM ON'T LEARNING T
Line_1321	O CAPE SO THE PWASTICK
Line_1322	THE STEEL MT THE STEEL THE
Line_1323	YOU'RE TO BYE MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A CIRCUIT
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE  NAIL AND IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE AND THE FLAG IS ALEUING BY THE ARIC
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND ROUND AN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH AOND THE WIRE
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT T'S NOT METAL
Line_1329	IT STAPS IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE  IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UMSU
Line_1331	YEAH MAGNEY
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANL AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STLY IT'S GETING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MILK THE CAND
Line_1334	BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WOULD TO B ABLED THREE
Line_1335	IT MELTS BECAUSED OF FIRE  IT CAN IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IT'S LIKE OVING SO THAT UM WE CAN SO THAT IT'S IEARE
Line_1337	NOB I COULD NOT S THINKK
Line_1338	IT WAS A SALABN I DON'T WAT I IT WA'S FIRE
Line_1339	IT S CICULAR ENERGY OFFHONUH BE YEAHI
Line_1340	IT MAKES DOWN SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GASS BULE APPLES AND A FIRE
Line_1343	MEIAL WIRES APPLE WOOD BULAX STUFF AND A G
Line_1344	IT GOES ON AND ON
Line_1345	THE SOLAR PARALL S ETREY ANDJ
Line_1346	H ESTH
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT TIS
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN LEARTCG MADREC
Line_1349	UH THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STREAGHT ONE IS CURVED AND THE ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	IT MITKS UH CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IT
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIGEOER REFRIGERATOR
Line_1352	WELL IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE UHETTIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNITCK AND SO THE EFRIGERATOR IS BAD
Line_1354	WELL THE  THE THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE RE
Line_1355	THEY STIZ BECAUSE THA THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MAGN THE MAGNETC IS TOUCHING THETHE SCREEN
Line_1357	WELL ATTRACTTRITY DOAUS BUT IT  DOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT  IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1359	DOLCA
Line_1360	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ARINER
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1364	BECAUSE ON HAS IRON
Line_1365	I
Line_1366	IT'S WILL
Line_1367	ENTHERGY HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BA
Line_1369	THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO A LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WEIST THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THE WIRES JUST GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL OR THE PLUSS SIDE
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO IT'S NORML SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENTEVER I PUSHE
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SOPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SOPOSED TO BE EACH END
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MAING IT'S LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED OF
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN NOT PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IS STARID TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RON BECAUSE IT S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AND NEEDS METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR A TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ATRICITY FOR A PIECE OF AND NTE
Line_1381	NO ONE SIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
Line_1382	INSULATORS RE ARE HELPFL
Line_1383	IT STARES TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ANER
Line_1384	SO
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN  BE PULCKED OTN
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT IT'S MELTEN
Line_1388	HEATE ENERGY HEATE ENERGY IS A NOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUNDMUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND TROPT I HEURD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
Line_1390	IT'S HEATING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING UM
Line_1391	OU'RE GIVING OUT YOU'RE ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GYOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOKISS UM THE SOUND AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HER FEETS
Line_1393	UM SHE IS GETTING N THE ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS
Line_1394	THE APPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PAN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE GASS ISAN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	FRBECAUSE THE COAL HAS BEEN BEARNED AND THE GASS HOAUSANDI GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MELT THE ERTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE CTHEEIS IN EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	IT WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT RENEWABLE
Line_1400	IT IS A COMPLETE THE FORM MAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
Line_1401	WEELL U I THINK THAT THEY LIGHE THE DOT OR THE ENERGY AND  THAT'S WHATSS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB WIGHTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TO THREE B THERE IS FOR PATHWAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO BU D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK GO WEARK MAYBE
Line_1405	E JIFE TH THREE UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS A NOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLAS OF THE WIRES AND THEY DREN'T CIPOS TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS STWORD AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE NOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES IS A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THEERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR AU DS WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UHM I KNOW
Line_1413	THAT WHAT THE LIGHT BULBS BROK
Line_1414	TL THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEEI SEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1416	B IS SWITCHE FOR A NO ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT THE BATTERY
Line_1418	GOD BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHEN YOU WARE TOLPY AND M I
Line_1419	BUB STARED TO WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	FO I STRICA LIGHT ISE PARTY
Line_1421	THER WIRES HOLBDS LIKE ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1422	WELL IT WILN'T WORK ET MOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE TLIKE T THE ENERGY IS HOLD FBATH
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANING BOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALL READY TRYDED OUT AND STUF
Line_1424	I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOEN'T SO THE WRE
Line_1426	OH BARETY AND CAN LIKE PLEASE IS FIC
Line_1427	IGH BULB ROWE AND HE
Line_1428	IT BILLE BRROK SO I DOD THE WORK SO ITIN T HAS TO CHANE TE FORL
Line_1429	WE SED A SERIES CIRCUIT AND TA PALL
Line_1430	TH WORK ETING MORE BECAUSE IT'S THATIT'S
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THA ELECTRICITY'S GOING TO ALL THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UH N IT DOEN'T T WORKS ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER E
Line_1433	FROLKIT AND IT DOESN'T LIGHT AYU WORK
Line_1434	WELL  WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERYS
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A CUPLE AF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE SHRYING BE
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO WER WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SROM POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO CKEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY DUL THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP THE POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING
Line_1440	UM POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASH LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO WHOLD YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEVES POWER AND T FROM THE UM WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND VE
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYSE GOES FROM TOP TO
Line_1445	UM WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEN AND DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHIY IT'S I DIDN'T  ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN SEE THE PIXTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES ND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MO
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING US POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIR
Line_1453	A SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRS ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES UTHE SOURCED POWE
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	THEY THE PERSON HO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW IT
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER SORC POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN FORT
Line_1460	ITALE HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISS CONNECTED
Line_1461	WHENTEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO A IT WON'T
Line_1462	ITCH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHTWAY
Line_1463	WEELL WE DOUDN'T ACTUALLY EARN ABOUT TE MEA BECAUSE THE PA THE WE GOT THE LEIGHD BY THE SNO
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS
Line_1466	WEOU'RE TRYING TO MIXTURE IT'S WITH DIFFERENT
Line_1467	SWITCH OND ME A LUMIN AM NAIL

Line_1469	SWITCH THE METAL
Line_1470	TH IT'S SOCHANG THE SWITCH AND THE METAL OF ITS MAHE
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	IT'S NOT THEEN ERLLY ELS TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST WAL
Line_1473	IT'S MAKING IT WORK NO
Line_1474	WE'E WEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS A LIGHT BETER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF
Line_1477	THE FLAM GLARS OFF AND IT MOUVES AROUND T THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_1478	IT BURNS IN THE WAX IT MELTS
Line_1479	UH IT SOUNDED IT'S COMING LIKE POPPING A LITLE IT BECAUSE ITWAS A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOME MOTTERYS HITTING THE BOMGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AN IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVING MANERS
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EVING CARIING ANDTHAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DISC FAND CHREE BRANCHES RAISENS AND STEELE
Line_1483	IT GIVES MORE ARO BECAUSE OF THE THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE C THE FIRE CAN POLLUTE AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT  FLICS THE AIRE
Line_1486	IT'S NON AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HIDEY
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A FAMIN A MOTE
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WIT OUR SELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR U IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	UM THE FRUNT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SINE DOWN TO THE MINES
Line_1494	CLOSER THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND THE

Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHTH AR
Line_1497	IT 'LL GET REALLY LIGHT AND WEAY
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAY BE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNS BATTERES REALLY QUIP
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES DIT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHER
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWISCE ON THOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRUGH
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWISE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MEANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERY SERIES CIRCUITS HADE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE MIT'S NOT A COMPLETE SHUR
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT WHATCHS THE BULB I THINK IT HAPEN BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE SUN
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILM  BRAKES IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYE
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTCH OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKE
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS STROPS NOT BOTH OF THEM

Line_1520	THAT THEREW'LL BE MALTIMALY PATHWAYS IN THE SERIES AND INSTEAD OF E
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER UP BOTH OF THE LIGHT
Line_1522	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WORE UH LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BEE THAT THAT D
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT

Line_1588	THAT THE MAGNETS STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPERROTHERS WILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE IS STEEL R ONE STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I DID
Line_1591	THAT IT STICKED
Line_1592	STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN STICK TO MAGNET

Line_1608	THEN TELL THE MAGNET GETS TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	TH THE MAGNETIVE FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METTAL CLIP AND THE METTAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET ARAWY
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS ING
Line_1611	WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	THAT WHEN IT GETS  NINTEEN WASHERS AND BAGNETISOM BREAKE
Line_1613	THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	THE SPACERS WERE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY TIRMES I NEEAD TO SA THA
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHERS
Line_1619	IT TOOK NIN SPACERS SO HRAING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO RAPPID AROUND THE ELECTROW MAGNETT
Line_1622	THAT'S THE WIRES RAT RAPPED ABOUNT THE RIVET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODCW LIKE WOLE STICK TO THE RIVE
Line_1623	SO IT PRODUCES THE ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRYS ELMAGNETISM FORCE SO IT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METAL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET  CAN CARRYED METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THATS THE ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IT IS NOT AN ELECTRO MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IF THIS ELECTRO MAGNET IT COULD IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS CLOSED
Line_1631	IT STORTS TO PICK UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1633	THE RUH SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	THE BE WRAPPED ABOUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1635	IVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BLB
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT ALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELLUM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TOLL TO USE
Line_1639	UM I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE UM IT'S A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1640	UM I THINK WHAT TRAVELS AND WIRES AS ENERGY TOOK HER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROUME ORE ANY THING THAT NEEDS LIGHT AND DARK NESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGH CAN YOU REPETE THAT PLEASE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINEST SCINE BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I COAN THINK OF RIGHT NO WHAT YOU HAVE TANN
Line_1645	IT GOES OUTOF THE MINES SINE AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUTOE LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE P
Line_1646	I THINK THE PLODOS REPERT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINES SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONE COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHAT IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BYE MARNEY THAINK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE GREAIHT HEL
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO TFLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEVES
Line_1652	ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO THE CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE SOLAR PANELE
Line_1659	UN IS GIVING THE CELL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAGSUP
Line_1660	I THINK ITS IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WAST ENERGY ANDWELL IT DOESN'T WAST
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPINING IN THIS CIRCUT
Line_1664	U THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS OU THE WIRES INTO THE TO MAKE THE FLAG
Line_1665	YOU TWO MARNEY THANKOU BYE
Line_1666	IVE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTOR SIN AROUND AND
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE DIFFERENT STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROWND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND AN
Line_1670	I H'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN NO
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE MOTORS SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPAN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL NOT WORK
Line_1674	BAN SI ING TOPEON MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DISCRIVE IT AS CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1677	CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE EANYTHING METAL ADACOURIN CAN CREAT OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
Line_1679	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASST RUBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNEY I HADD A REALLY GRATE TON
Line_1681	GOODGOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW YOU W
Line_1683	U HOW  DO W WELL I FORGOT BECAUSE WOID ITNT'T
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT
Line_1685	I FORGOT IT SOM
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY AND THEN LIKE IT LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND MAY BEINTO EVERYTHING
Line_1688	IT'S FOLLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WEK
Line_1689	DIBLUE OTS OR DE UH ELECATRICITY
Line_1690	THEY CONNECT OMY BOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE I THE LITTR REINDMY OF ELECTRICITTY
Line_1691	THE UBHEFRION IS THAT IT GOES ATOA D CELL IT GOES A MAGNATLIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WHE WARE
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THAT METAL IN THE APAND
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THRRY FOR FIVE SIX EAND A NIN
Line_1694	THERE WOULDN'T BE MORE ENERGY AND THEN LIGHT BULB I LIGHE
Line_1695	UM MORE RBULBS UM MEANS LESS THE IGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILLN'T GET BOLTH ARE AND DOSN' NO VEERY GO
Line_1697	I THINK THAT LIGHE BULBS WOULD IGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WHITCH ONE D CELL IS NOT VARY BRGED BUT THE ONE WITH DO THESCIS IS VLY LY
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT ATTAL
Line_1700	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANE IK TO D
Line_1701	BY FLIPING IT OVERI GUET
Line_1702	WITHDAHELS I I WOULD MIXE
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT IT OS  NOT ACTUALLY UT NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE ME WIRES AND WIRELS MEATING SPRATER LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	I HEARE DRIMING DONT NOT
Line_1707	I  UH THINK THAT THE BOUTER I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB LB DEM
Line_1708	I NO ABICE TWENY BERDS AND YS ROLLING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE FORE PATHWAYS MAYI
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK UM IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	I REMEMBER THAT IT GOES OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIE
Line_1713	UM I THINK IT IS SWALLING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE D
Line_1714	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHWAY
Line_1716	UM I DON'T KNOW OW ALLY
Line_1717	I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PIXTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PIXTURE HAS A WIRES
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE I WELL I DON'T KNO
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'R DIMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT  ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	I CIRECE THE THE TOP WOR ORG
Line_1721	IT THINKS THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT THS ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOOLD BECAUSE IT'S BTHEIR BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I AM MARNING H
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT UM THE SWITCH I'S NOT OM IN ORVIERAYSO IT'S BUNOT MIGHTY
Line_1726	BECAUSE F THE TWITCH IS NOT PROECTED T EM
Line_1727	UM Y I THINK THAT ON TH BUB WOULD NOT ILIGHT TO YOU
Line_1728	I DON'T MOUM  W
Line_1729	UM THA LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT T AND
Line_1730	WHAT HAPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BLB GOES OUT IS THE THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LEIS NT LIGHING OFF CLOR
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE IGHT BULB MAYBE
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILLIMAN BRAKES THE UBOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT HIS BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILMA IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS INLIGHTING BECAUSE OF THE ONE IS BROKN
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BEURNED OUT BECAUSE OF THE FIULEMA RILLP SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGH
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLEATLY STOP
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT HAPPMS WHEN THE BULB BRAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T PULL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	UM A PARALLEL MAET
Line_1738	WHENEVER ONE BREAKES THE OTHER IT'S LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HASE IT'S ON WIRES
Line_1739	I NOTICED THAT WHENEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILLMIT BRAKES BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON TAE BULB UM N THE  ENERGY COMPOLE LE STOPS
Line_1741	I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BRAKES THE OTHER ONES STEEL W
Line_1742	THE MIXTURE HAS TO DO WITH THE BULB BURNING OUT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES FLANCED
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE ARE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH OTOHE LIGHT BULBB
Line_1744	I THINK THOM BULB IS LID UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS
Line_1745	WHEN EVER ONE BULB BERNS L THE OTHER ONE BRIKS OUT
Line_1746	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER A ONE BULB BEURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BEURNS OUT
Line_1748	WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM D US  LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BUONE FILLIMET IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	VE WHENEVER THE FILLIMIT BREAKES THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STUP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF E ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILLMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	UM I THINK  I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN WIRES
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDRULBS UMWHENTEVER ONE FILIMANT BREAKES THE OTHER ONES STILL LIGHTS
Line_1756	CECTRICITY STOPS THE ENERGY STUPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT REALATS TO THE LAST ONE I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILLIMET IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
Line_1760	I THINK THEY LOOK THAT ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILMIT BREAKS AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	UI KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UMI NOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB IS LIDD UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS  ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	I THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	IVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	BWHATEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANY THING WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRIGE IS ETHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IT MORDERS FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET AND IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY RIVER MADE OUT OF UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	IT THEY HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CIRTAIN TYPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS EER FOUL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE ETHER MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE ITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERIES WIRES AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MEADE THE WOOD
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILLS LIGHT UP THE
Line_1787	THAT IS  VL USE TO LIGH
Line_1788	IT IT'S LIGHTING UP THE
Line_1789	YEOORE
Line_1790	IT FLOES BY IT HAS LESS OF ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE WULB TO MAKE IT ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN IN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO HECU
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWMING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE FL
Line_1794	IT'S MOVING TO THE MINEST SWIT
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINES
Line_1797	IT'S GIVING LESS OF ENERGY
Line_1798	UM TOSEE
Line_1799	IT DOESN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	ITO GIVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING POWER
Line_1802	ITS
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN IT TURN ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER SO
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SISTOM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOP
Line_1808	IT'S GOING AROUND THE WIRES AN INTO THE MOTOR TME
Line_1809	LEARNING H
Line_1810	THE MOTOR S MOVING
Line_1811	AN STINING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE WE S GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TT INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT SLINK
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SONGE ON IT IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1814	D CELL WIRESMOTOR
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY AND
Line_1816	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T STIN
Line_1817	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T GIVE ENERGY
Line_1818	THE 'S AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1819	THE SPOUNGE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1820	THEY ARE DIFFERENT CAUS SOME ARE METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S A METAL ITT'S SELLUH THAT
Line_1822	IT FLVED THAT WHEN YOU PUT METAL ONTO T WHN IT WAS E
Line_1823	IT W W'LL NOT SPING
Line_1824	IT WHAT HAPENS IS THAT IT WON'T MITE
Line_1825	THE NOT THE SPIN COULD IT'S METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE CALLED THEY AREMAKING THES UNDRSTAD BECAUSE I CAN'T NOE
Line_1827	IHAH

Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELL GIVE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT UP THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING HA PATHWAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN THEIRE SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACH INTO THE D CELL
Line_1862	CO DOCTS
Line_1863	IT'S BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THTHE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1865	THE ENERGY
Line_1866	MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERG
Line_1867	WHENY WHEN YOU ADD ENUFTH IR D CELL IT WILL LIGHT UP IGHTER
Line_1868	AD A D CELL TO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT LIGHTER SO IT GETS B SO MORE
Line_1869	ONE THESE ONE LIGHT BULBS HAS A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY OF TL GOE A WILL PASS THROUGH

Line_1880	THEY
Line_1881	WE'VE EN THAT WE'VE EN MAN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING AND L
Line_1882	IT'S ITS GOIN
Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN IT YOU TURN IT ON IT RILL TURN ON  THE LIGHT WON'T
Line_1884	THEN YOU MAIHT HAVE TO SPIL IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT RONG
Line_1885	IT WEILL WAIGHT UP
Line_1886	IT THAT IT WILL BEURN OUT BECAUSE IT BROKAN
Line_1887	ET IT'S VILL IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT SPROK IT WILL CIRCLE NDE
Line_1889	IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ON TWO LONGE PROPERL
Line_1890	ONE LIGHTS RAN OFF RN AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT
Line_1891	IT'S ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WEILL STOP THERN
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY FOURCE
Line_1894	IT'S M WHEN IT IPS RA OUT
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT LIGHT CIRCUIT
Line_1896	IN THE ENERGY WILL STAOT
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WILL STUFF ON MEXT
Line_1899	BECAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NOFTHING CHAPONING
Line_1901	IT'S OST
Line_1902	ECAUSE IT THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS AROUND OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISOM ATTRACTING AND RE
Line_1904	WHEN YOU D NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT HEN SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH OND ONE SIDE OND THA OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	IS WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I NO
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRA
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MAGNE
Line_1909	IT' BECAUSE IT HAS IRON INSIDE F IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACTS TO THAS IRON IN SIDE OF IT YOU DOESN'T HAVE IRON STOUT OF
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPETE THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIND HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOS
Line_1913	ETER HAS IRON AND THE MAGNETUS IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHAY IT A
Line_1915	MAGNET STICK TO IRON
Line_1916	BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOESN' HAVE IRN
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE TSIT
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON AND NE
Line_1919	THE YEL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NO METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACTIT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DAN'
Line_1927	THAT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE BEEN CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_1929	THEN D CELL IS ID A CIRCUIT RITIT'S THE IXT
Line_1930	BECAUSE WHEN WON'T GO THE WIRES IT'S SLOLVIES OU NDD OTHERE ELECTRICITY AS LIKE THES MAKE THEI
Line_1931	THAT ELECTROCITY S DON'T GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	A SAL HAS TO BE APTULTD EN WIRES TO GO RA TO BOTH MAR LIKE TRICITY TO BEOWID
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GO  BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT DROPS CRE CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE PLOTTER AP
Line_1935	OMETAL AND CHREAL TO THE E OF SOLS I MAKE THAT YU'LL R I V TO GET LF OFOLLY PE
Line_1936	IT'S NOTCTOUCHING METAL SO WHEN ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WON'T MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WILN'T GO THROUGH A D CELL AND IT WILN'T TRO UP THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH MANT TRIY UH
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE  IS SHAING THIS THE THAT IT IT MORE BUT WHEN IT COMES FTHEN IT WILL WORK AND THE FLAG BOE
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT ER
Line_1942	IT WOULDN'FE R T COULD THET HAS TO PY CEMTY AND  ONT HAVE TO MAKE IT ESER
Line_1943	TELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND L AND THEN IT GOES IN TO THAT LITTLE TRACTN AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAD MOVER
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOES
Line_1945	PRODCIL ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG ME
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MEAREBING BECAUSE T IT DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT AND IT IS A HEAVY ELECTRICITY WHICH WEAN NT IVE
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL THE WAGH TO THE MOTOR AND LIKING THE FLAG RM
Line_1949	IS HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING A FLAGTHUH
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HUKED UP TO THE SWITCH
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WILN'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	LET THE SWITCH A B OFF
Line_1953	IT DOSN'T A
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR STUCKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL ARE HE WEIGHT TO THE STELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN NOES AT HITS THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1956	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNY
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING ENT UP THE CLOUDY DY IT IT STOPS WORKAG
Line_1958	IT DOUS IT WA
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	IT MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CRE ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING THE CICUITS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG BLUM
Line_1963	ELECTRICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECT TO  TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR TO LIGHT
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	IT HAVE TO MAKE A PASS WHEN YOU CONNECTED IT
Line_1969	IT LIKE THE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT M IT GOES BAC
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTOR TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE POSITI
Line_1974	NEO IT'S GOING THE S WEIGH BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WIDY BUT IF IT WAS TRND ON IT WOULD BE GOING THE PPOSIT
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWASE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THOUGH A LITTLE LIGHT BULB
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE B  THE TWO BACES OF THE BULB I DONT WHANTO WORKBECASE THE WIRES PSTO CAL UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOULD WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FIND WE'VE MET THE FOR
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOUVE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AN ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT A PAY
Line_1981	YOU SHOUL PUT A NAIL IN THEIRE IT'S IT'S LIKE WEAIGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFOR
Line_1983	YEH GOOD HOW ARE YO I NOW YOU'RE MET BEFOR B THE I DON'T WAN O MAKE YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
Line_1985	SHING THE SINH UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO YEAH DOT
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO ST METAL SO HAS TO MAKE IT  WORK
Line_1988	METAL  SOMETHING IF SOMETHING S METAL THEN IT IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL AND THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL D THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT  CONDUCTORS ARE STHINGS THAT AREMETAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILLD NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO LOB
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL AN THE LITTLE MAY THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID AMORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIPE RIER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART BUM
Line_1997	UHM SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIX
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS IND YOUR FOD
Line_1999	ALL OF THE TE DIFFERENT FOD MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BULBE BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYIND ON TOP OND THE FIELE
Line_2001	THE WATER IS FILTERRIN
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SANDS STADE IN THE COPY FILTE
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILTERIN
Line_2004	SOM THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_2005	THE SALTS WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALVETD WE CALLED THE SOLID MATERIAL SALTVE
Line_2007	WE NOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUSTEVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU BIXK SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHAT YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	Y WIF JUST DIDE AGAIN
Line_2010	SOTIEL PROACTS
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIEL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DIPENDING ON THE ARIEA
Line_2013	THEY SAD THAT TH THERE WERE THERE IS THEES THINGS IN SWA THERE IS THOSE THINGS IN SWAA
Line_2014	THERE IS HOME GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN IT
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEATE THAT
Line_2016	ULMMS GRAVLE CLAY AND SILK
Line_2017	OLMS SCRALE CLAY AND SILCK
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTE MOUNTS AND AND FARM LANS HAVE MOR ORGANIC CARVON
Line_2019	DELT HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MITDTAL
Line_2020	THERE IS A LOT OF THE PROPERTYES OF SOIL AND THAT THING BECAUSE IT HAS ILCLAY HUMS GRAVEL AND THAT'S STUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUMEA SCRAPFLE CLAIND CILT AND THIS SILE
Line_2023	ALL THETERCACE WITH THE PUMPED UP CIT
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A WLOT OF PLANT MY LIKE CAPCD AND CAC AND BOUSHES AND MORE CACDIZE
Line_2025	THELTE HAS TO LIT MORE SANDS THEN IT DOS
Line_2026	GOOD B YEAH
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLOY
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES AND THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT AS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S PLAIN ONE OF THE MIXED
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLASE REPETE THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOH THE SALT DISOLVETHE BBDISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEEAN IT'S BULLB TO PLAT AND NOT IT'S BEAN BIGGIESH
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEATE THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_2035	YEER
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	IT CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTE
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FIRST GOT THE E
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWING UP INTO THE AIRE AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAIND ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED IN TO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU CALT IT HOW
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLED
Line_2044	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPERE
Line_2045	UM TIME LOTS OFE LOTS OF TIME
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLUT OLVEN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER E A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THE THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITH OUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLED IT WOULD NOT MAKE ALUTION MIXTER
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER ITWILL
Line_2053	THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOWER MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTION
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IN THE COP FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE LFILTERED OUT
Line_2060	YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BBECAUSE SO MIX
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THE SCY OR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPORA
Line_2065	TA YOU PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAISE A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWS
Line_2068	SPONS ARE FLOTING
Line_2069	IE
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EATHER IT'S SWEATER OR BITTER
Line_2072	THEY ARE GOING TO BE UM HARED SWEATER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEATER AND THEY LOOK DENSWER
Line_2074	THEY ARE DILUTED
Line_2075	THE LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOUL RE PEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATER OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD ETHER TAKE OUT FIFUM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT  MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY ICKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	LL OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES A TASTER AND ONES  OBSERVE
Line_2083	WHEICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON A SCAIL
Line_2084	ONES TEN GR TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WOILLD BE HEAVIER THAN A OTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	UM SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION BON A SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENCITY HAS IS THE COR CAT IS LIGHTER THAN THE PONY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLO
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT THINKS
Line_2096	BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MAY HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THAN THINGS WOULD FLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIXE BUT THEN WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIXED
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A AM FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED AND GOT BA
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CANT GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRAM IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THEN  THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIXD
Line_2104	BUT THES GOE BYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE SHOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ACID
Line_2109	BECAUSE UM IT
Line_2110	MOUNTHEAR
Line_2111	THE SAME CHARE AND OUR SCIENCE AND NO BULBS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIXS GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE I SAD
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPINKY SOME ARE SPINKE
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S LIKE
Line_2118	SORE AT AGAN SO WAS WHAT WAS YEALL YEAH HOW I DUM I
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SEAD THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NO
Line_2122	WE'VE BEEN DING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANTS AND THEY REACT OFF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTEDS
Line_2126	E BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT AC CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	ET'H TWO
Line_2128	THEYARE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTENTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUMIDE NOFTHING THRONG
Line_2130	IN SODA IC CALCIUUM CHLAROND EACH TO E
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT'STOA PRECIPITATES
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'RE AREA BE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO IF THERE IS NOFTHING HABNING JUST ISE GETTING PUT IN IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASSIS SWAT
Line_2135	THE WATERS CHANGING COLOR
Line_2136	IT'S PITY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS  BUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIXED AND I DON'T KNOW WHIE
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE ERE
Line_2141	YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECAND ONE HAS NOT METAL
Line_2143	IF A PRODUCT S LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIX OR IF IT TURN HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	UM CALCIOUMCLORED WATER AND  SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY ETHER BLUGH UP THE BAG AND THIE FIGSED
Line_2147	THERE IS GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCE IS WEIERED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CEMICAL REACTION ON SCAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE IS HAS MORE SALT
Line_2152	I MEISE I TEN REAE LTER AND RABECHELE
Line_2153	THOT ONEE
Line_2154	SOIL WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THEIR TWO ASE GRAVERLAY AND SILT
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A TOPING  STEEL
Line_2157	WELL FIRST THE VALE SHICKE IT UP SO AND IT'S GONNA MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GONG TO SETAL AND IT'S GONNO TURND DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY THA SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT WAS MY FRENDY SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SE
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNETYING ON THE BOTTM OF HA SCREEN
Line_2164	DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSEONES ARE ON CLED
Line_2165	NO FARNEY YEAH
Line_2166	THEY'RE ALL HUNGE PROPERTIES O SHO AND THATAL
Line_2167	WE'R ARE LEARNING ADMITER THE BT OT CONCOOR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTN OR A FORMIMANT OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	BIYE BIYE E LES
Line_2171	WINDD WATER YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILND THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE A NOTHER STOWN AND THEN IT STARTED WETHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF BRUM TO THEN HIT A CUP IF ROCKS AND THI SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
Line_2174	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVERL TUN AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A ROE UNTO
Line_2176	THE BULBERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE
Line_2177	THEY HAVE TO GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE AL HAS BEEN IN THEIR WEIGH MORE THAN THE BULBERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETING PAMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN THE STREEN
Line_2179	CILE ANYBODY THERE HARETDOL HADE AT OALL
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOWABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CEMICAL WEATHERING FISICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHAINGE DROPS
Line_2182	UM LET'S GO COM ON  YOU L
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER ASODRAIN THAT'S HITTING THE WIME STON AND DISCINEGARATING
Line_2184	FORETH WHAT IS T WHAT I SA
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ASSID RAIN IS COMING DOWN SHIFKING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE LIN
Line_2186	RAIN AND PURCIT
Line_2187	THE WROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT'S TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SAND STON THE RAIN FEREESE DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMIDGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIME STON AFTR ACSIRDRAIN AFTER A ER STEEL HAD
Line_2190	IT DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HOL NO ANYBUDY THERE
Line_2192	IT UBRAGED AND IROTED
Line_2193	ACSIDRAIN AND ALSO EROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CU BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE WROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CUP MANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS KILLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE I LONDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITON
Line_2199	THE SCREEN TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING MES ING CLASSE
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND IRUION
Line_2201	EVERSION AND E IT'S IN AD AND A CANION

Line_2204	THE S TII IEUM
Line_2205	POSITION DE POSITION
Line_2206	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
Line_2207	IT'S A VALLY AND UM WHEN WE HAVE THE FLOW
Line_2208	I DON'T GOW
Line_2209	THE ROSION AND ERTH MAE CIRCUIT CARED AWAY
Line_2210	DOLTA DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT THING THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREEM TABELES
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS UM ALL THE WAIY DOW UNTO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE IS NOT A FING CLOSED TO THE BULB
Line_2213	THEA FLAT IS MEANDERING AND THEN STEEL IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEE SLOP IS GOING VERY FLA FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOWP IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND CORNERS
Line_2215	THE FLOUD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY UM DIPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GON UH
Line_2218	IT'S HIR IN THE FLOD

Line_2232	MINERALES GO INTO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MANEE
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCAIL TO SEE HOW HARD UM R AR WE DID THIS IND CLASC
Line_2234	NOFTHING HAPPANS HERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIMAND CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WIRES IT ALWAISE MAKE A MARK

Line_2240	THIS IS SO SAD I NO WAT YOU LIVE
Line_2241	OLY STUMBING PARENTS
Line_2242	LOP AND SCRATCH THE TILEYEAH
Line_2243	IT MAKES JAET A BATH
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH THE SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS MIXTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	TDOON'
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GREP TATH STICK
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WAHE
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LIGHTS UH
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T LUSE ANY WAIGHT IT JUST ADDS
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHAN
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOGH YOU CANT SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LUSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION IN THE END
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOLED OU
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS SO
Line_2258	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT OT AND THE COSY FILDE
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIX
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET HOT IND THE SOL
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPE
Line_2263	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPER AND LEFT THE SOLED WBEHIND THE CON
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE TE
Line_2266	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PRODUCTION AS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MAHES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAVS TWISE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE OT
Line_2270	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TO SOLUTE CONCET
Line_2272	THAT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
Line_2273	IT MEANS BYE
Line_2274	THE PANY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE CORT
Line_2275	THE TENTY WEIGHES MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTE
Line_2278	SOLUTION BE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWED ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTUM
Line_2283	THE LITER IF WE ADD THE LITER SALT SOLUTION WACT THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON TOP
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION BE IS TRYING TO SICNK TO THE BOTTM
Line_2285	AUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2286	THAT'S SO
Line_2287	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUT SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE ACH T
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SHOGER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINET
Line_2295	FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THERE FOR IT WEIGH
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT AN THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAM
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UM
Line_2299	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH IT'S SOLUTION WAIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I TELL YOU THAT
Line_2303	THEY SATURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	ITN' DUSE SCIENCE TODY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTENTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THER IS BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORY
Line_2308	SOLVENTAS SOLUTE
Line_2309	THEY ARE LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICED THAT THE MOLECULES ARE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFERE
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT UIT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE SALLITHINGS
Line_2314	THERE IS A PERIES CIPIT THERE IS A PREE CIPATE LEFT
Line_2315	YOU MIXED SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WATER AND THE HIDROLIC CORICK
Line_2316	THE SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE IS ALL ONE MOLECUL THE WATER IT HAS TWO TYPS OF MOLE
Line_2317	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE ICSCIE
Line_2320	UM THERE WARE BUBBS
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCT OF SHISING AND THEN IT SETALED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOW AND ON AND IT'S GETING RUFS STEE
Line_2323	THE GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS THE CHEMICAL REACTIN
Line_2324	THE REST ON THE BIK I ON'
Line_2325	THE GLOW STICK STARTED GLOWING
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FILESC A LOT AND THEN THE SECUANT ONE DIDFIL
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FIZES AND HAS A PREECIPTTAINE
Line_2329	YOU MADE ISE THREE UHM
Line_2330	THEAT BOTH THAT DN'S E
Line_2331	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONENT TRATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEIR MOLECUES LOKED
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LIRES IND THE BAG
Line_2335	A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND THE GASS
Line_2336	CALCIUM CHLORAID IND BAKING SODA
Line_2337	A SOLID LIQUID AND THE GA
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE
Line_2339	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2340	THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BAG WEIGHS LESS
Line_2341	BECAUSE ONE OF THE BAXIS OPEN WHICH LETDOUT ALL OF THE GAES
Line_2342	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL RMELAND
Line_2343	THERE IS HUMN GRAVEL CLAIN AND SIELT
Line_2344	HUMINS GRAVEL CLAY AND SIL
Line_2345	THEY ARE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2346	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2347	THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2348	
Line_2349	U
Line_2350	THERE
Line_2351	SOILES AND ROCK AND LAND FORMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_2352	THERE IS WRATER AND THEIR CRACS AND THE WRATER FS
Line_2353	AK WAY THE RING HER I THINK IT WAS
Line_2354	FREASING AND OBRASON
Line_2355	UBBRASON
Line_2356	THE WROLTS BREAKED PART
Line_2357	T I SAD WILL YOU MARY ME AND SHE SAD YES TREETS CAN BREAK RACTS APART GOOD THINKING
Line_2358	THE TRERT IS GROWING DOWN AND LOOKING FOR WATER AND THE ROCK IS IN ITS WAY SO THE TREE ROUGH BREAKES
Line_2359	TE THE THE ANDS FAVER
Line_2360	WHEN THE WATER FRAMSS IT EXPANS
Line_2361	THEY WERE LIKE ROLLED DOWN OREVER AND THEN THEY LIKE BROK UP AND THE SMALLER PIECES
Line_2362	AS THEY GO DOWN THE PIECES GETS MORE
Line_2363	THE TT GRAB
Line_2364	FEING EXTREEMLY TERABLE TO DY SO YOU DON'T KNOW ANEY DAT
Line_2365	CMICAL WEATHERING AND STUFF THINK THAT I GUESS
Line_2366	THE IME STON IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE OF THE ACID
Line_2367	THE SALT IS MEION TO THE VINEGAR BUT THE LIME STONE CAN BE
Line_2368	U
Line_2369	BECAUSE OF TREMICALE VETRY
Line_2370	I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY
Line_2371	WELL MUFTHING THROUGH BE HAPUNING TO THE STRACI D SO I DON'T KNO
Line_2372	I HAVE NO I DEA
Line_2373	IS FORMING THE LIME STOWN INDO IT
Line_2374	ONNE YEAH
Line_2375	THE WATER IS WEATHERING AWEIGH THE LIME STOWN TO MAKE THE CAVE AND SE OU A LINE
Line_2376	THO ICOE WETHERING I EANING AND MENING TS TEN
Line_2377	YOU SHOED ME THIS LAST TIME AND I EXPLAIN IT ALREADY IT O NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT AGIN
Line_2378	DO'N' ROWN
Line_2379	OH I DIDN'T T THEOW WON'T
Line_2380	AND IF THEY YOURE MADE OF BESICHIS THAT MEANS
Line_2381	SPAUN AND ER IBROWSE LOKE LIKE BA OF THEEN ROCK IS
Line_2382	THERE IS SCREEN BUT AND NTHERRING
Line_2383	AND THE WEATHERING HAVE BEEN THERE AND YOUR IYBROWUSE OE CQUICKD BY THE AS I SAID
Line_2384	BUT NE AN'T KNO WETHERING E
Line_2385	BANINEA WETHERING HAS HAV BEENG TO THE BANANE STATCHU WITH BANANA IBRAWS SO T LOK LIKE ARBANAN IBROWS AND YOU'RE BANATA

Line_2387	WE H'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EROSION AND DES ITCI
Line_2388	THE ONE ON THE SLOP GOE DOWN MORE FARTHER THAN THE ONE ON THE NOWSE SLOP THE
Line_2389	WATER IT GOES MORE FASTER IF THERE IS MORE SLOP THAN IF THERE IS NO SLOP
Line_2390	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS LIKE THE WHERE IT'S STEEP THE WATER IS GOWING MORE FASTER
Line_2391	THE WATER WWENT THE SLOWP R
Line_2392	ON THE FLAT THE WAVTER IS FALLING SLOWLY AND ON THE STOEEP SULTD THE WATERS AN
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FLUDTHINGS THAT WE DIDN'T STUF
Line_2395	UTHE EROUSION AND DEPOSITION AND THE FLATWATER SOLUTION BUING  BIGGER BIGGER IS GOING MORE FARTHER
Line_2396	ONE WITH FLOWD CONDICTIONS THE ERUION GOE MORE FARTHER

Line_2431	THE ICIORROWSE
Line_2432	THEA POSITION

Line_2465	YEAH M
Line_2466	THAT IT DID NOT SCRATCH
Line_2467	BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY BOTH SCRATCH

Line_2502	ALE THEY DIDN'T UT THE HO WAS SOPPOSED
Line_2503	THAT THEY THERE ARE TWO SOFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT RE LECTS OFF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BALNCSING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BALUNSING OFF EVERY THING AND AND AWAY
Line_2509	REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BALNCING OFF ALL THEMETERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WIS SPLIT AND THE MITAL
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WIGHT LIGHTS
Line_2515	IT'S WIGHT
Line_2516	EVERYWUARE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISUM AND THEN THE PRISUM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLACS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BEBECOMES BLUGE
Line_2520	THE RY HEADDI METL IS SWIGHT AND THE RYS COMING OFF THE BULB ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBSORBED BY THE BLUE BULBE
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECT IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IT IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF TE REAINBOW
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BUBLB AND THEN THE
Line_2524	I THINK IT GIT'S OBSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BULB
Line_2525	THE BULB IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF GLIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPERE TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLEUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNGREEY
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE ONES BEHIND IT BERNS OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TWO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB CEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WRK
Line_2537	ECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN

Line_2562	WE LEARND HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES THE SAND AND WATER AN MIXTURE  DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAIN THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SALT
Line_2567	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID IND THIS MIXTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DES IS DISSOLVING
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND THE RESULT HAS ALL OF THE NOTS REASONS AND AMMAINLIM
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWES THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIXT DRORE
Line_2578	BY BUTTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILLTE ABOUT A SOLUTE AND A A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WEAIT NOH IT'S A SOLUTION SARY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED UPH THE WATER  GREAP TA STICK IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCAIL TO TELL WHITCH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO UNP
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	THEY WOULD TACE SHIGRIER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO I DEW WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO
Line_2593	THE TAIST IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUES
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATERS I THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COLAD BY HOW MUCH WATERS IND THE COLAD
Line_2597	I AM HAVING A BADD DAY ORNE
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TIYPE OF GASS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK STEE OR TWO WISN'T CREATED
Line_2601	CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TURN IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDAL IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CCALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE AREACTIN
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THEERE IS A BUBBLY M
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING AND WA WATER IS MICING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MAUSSE OVER THE THINGS MOLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE S
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APART
Line_2611	THE REACTEN MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PRODCT MOLECULE
Line_2612	M REPIETE THESE
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TIYPE A MOLECUL AND THE SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING MOLECUALES FROM THE HI DROLICK ACID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT FSOY
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEARE AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FIZED UP AND THEN CALMD DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SCTRAN PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A TEMICAL REACTION HERE I NO THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT F
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ON TO THE PAINEH RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NO THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BYE MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FIND MAKING SAMBWAGHES RIZDING ON CINS AND PLAING MORE
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2627	THE SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFOR T WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER T WAS SEPARATED
Line_2630	TH TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED AND THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAID ON THE TOP
Line_2634	IRE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THINGE HEAR IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WAHE
Line_2637	THE SOLUTET I BELIEIVE IS THE ONE THAT DOES
Line_2638	ALLEN MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTET IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM UM NOT QUIT SHEURE BUT I BELIEIVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE WA
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	UH PARDAN MEY MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASEYOUR PET THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALTS IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT I'M IS IT A QUARVLENT S
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALTWAS FILTERED ERBLE
Line_2648	WL THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CANT GET IT OUT
Line_2649	ONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY
Line_2650	THATS TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE ECICTRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BAK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	GOOD BY YOU'RE MY BESTIEST FEREND
Line_2656	WHATD OU WAN NO TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	UM THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHON HERE IS PARTICAL SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALLED THEM TOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SHURE MARNEY UM BALANCE ON IT
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BID
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETICK SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MAGNET
Line_2661	I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WEE HAVE BEEN STUDIING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS AL MORE GRP TASCSTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE DIARCK COLORD SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORD SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORD ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAST REALLY GROWS AND JUST REALLY DISSCUSSE THING AND YEAH THIT'S REALLY H IT REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAST PRITY BLAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION OUL  IT MIGHT TAST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLANE AND A LOT MORE TASTLESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREAN MARNEY HOW ARE YOH I'M EXSCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND AN OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YO UM KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TWO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WON'T YOU YOU CAN UNLESS YOU TAST IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDALE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THES SOLIDS IND IT STHEY ARE DIFFERENT PROPER
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISUM AND A SE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTYS
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZE
Line_2685	O TACK THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEE AND THE STONS STAD ON TO
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES HAIER THAN THE COLES AND THE STEE THE WROCKS ARE LARGE
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COPY FILTER AND THE SAND STAD ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COPY FILE
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS TROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPALT THAT SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOUE ARE PUTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
Line_2692	TODAY MARNEY WE LEARND HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUT A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PRODUCTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TE GRAM SOLUTED SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABL TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW H UP
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SEE IS THE MOST DILUT AND BE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2698	I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SIENCE
Line_2700	THE PEANY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORT
Line_2701	THE CORCK IS LESS DANSI THE PANEY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOW
Line_2703	I'M OKAY AMUNE CRUCHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPEAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY'RE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKGS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE H
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT UM I'M NOT SHURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTALLY WEI'VE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2723	IT I BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVAN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGTURED THE SLLT BY WAY
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BEE SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHIGAERER MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH A SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAN
Line_2731	SOUBSTANC SE IS SALT AR MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SOBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAK MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUAR CLEAR WIGH CRYSTAL
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPUMSALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
Line_2737	I'M DOING GRAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST CAN AVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CEMICAL REACTION IS HAPINING
Line_2740	CEMICALE REACTION
Line_2741	REACTANTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VEBEEN DOING IN SIENCE EVE IN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILE DESS I CAN'T GETS A REACTANT
Line_2745	SOLVAND
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS LOTS OF WERD STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAASS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASS
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GASS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERRY FOLGY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKE BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED OFF AND FIIS A LAT
Line_2754	THERE 'S SOME LITTLE WIGHT STUFF ON THE BOTTUM
Line_2755	THEYARE MISSING SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WITH HI DROW
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECUMES RALLY BLUGE AND THEN THEY TURND PURPLE A LITTLE A FYOU OF THEM TURNED PURPL
Line_2757	IT'S A UM THEY'RE MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NO SOLUTION OR CEMICAL REACTTHING
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PAIN
Line_2760	THE FINEL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ON SECANT THAUT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFFINETLY A REACTION HAPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FRIZING
Line_2763	THE WA THE BUBBLES AND THE CARBON WASHER ARE CARBON
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOLKING INTO ITS BONE
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST RE
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPINING TO THE PYPE
Line_2768	A CEMICAL REACTION IS HAPINING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ACURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE EVENTRAL MASSIS
Line_2776	THIS TELLS US THAT
Line_2777	IT I'M REALLY CIDED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEATE THAT MARNEY
Line_2780	MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MIX THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE TNS THE RASONS AND THE EMINMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PNS RAISONS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO OTHER OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPANS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT  MOST TOTALLY DISINEGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH TE
Line_2786	A SOLUTION
Line_2787	SOLUTE
Line_2788	A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN BECAUSE IT'S ERLLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR STICK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTOR EITHER
Line_2790	MARNEY I AVEL UT OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYEL YOU IN YOUR WORST
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GODING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMIL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLACES A SOLVENT LY A EALL GET AL
Line_2797	SARY MARNEY HAVE TO GO CAN SE YOU BETTER BY
Line_2798	I'M DOING GRAGHT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE ARE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSED
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH THE FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TWOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE SAM IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCK SO THE WROCK DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DUS
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEVLES AREN BIG ENOUFF TO SFT THROUGH THE SPAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE WHOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT TAND PROPERTY IS PEBLES ARE GETING STUCK IN THE FANTAP MARNE
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPERCLIPS
Line_2807	UH SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCK CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBLES THE SMALLER PEBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YO'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JRAR UNLESS YOU CAN PICK THEM AND THON WIT TAKES A WIRE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK ON TO THE
Line_2811	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET SO WORKED ON TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WAS BACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALLIZED THAT THE PEBLES GET STUCK IN THE SCREEN
Line_2814	YUSE THE SEM SO THAT IT WILL CACH THE BIG PEBLE
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPAND WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBLES GOT STOCK AND THE FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT WILL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VEAPPERY SHEINE
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNEY
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU MAM
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TO DIFFERENT REE SOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GREAP TAC STICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	E ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE SMUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAS MORE SLAVER
Line_2827	ONE WILL B A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	IT HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	SWEATER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER SWETER AND GREAPIER
Line_2832	ADD MORE GRAP TASTICK
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN  CAKE BYE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE'S RS
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SHIGER
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPNING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE STAIEL
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE E IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ISE CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION TURN
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DISCRIPION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PIXTURE IT SHOWES THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN I DENTIFY SALAD BAMS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKXES SEPARET AND TO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARET GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLE
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPEND S IT WEN'T BACK TOGETHER AND TIN IT IS PORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALTS WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALLED THEM A SOLUTE
Line_2863	THE SAND STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVEED
Line_2865	THE ROL THE WATER IS FLOWING AND THIS MIXTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW ONE'S SARY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE ROLES PLACE AND THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WASHER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WEIGH MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE MA
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREIGHTER
Line_2877	A MIXTUR
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEATE THAT MAIN
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MAM
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE MEY MAM BUT WHY DO YOU CEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWING AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO AN  UH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	M HORABLE TO DAY THINGS FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINDY GRAMS AND THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP F SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAVE AND IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PRODUCTION MY PRODUCTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SARY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECUAND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SOARY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEIVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST THAT'S THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DITURNMIN IS BY TASTING
Line_2900	WE ARE SEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND THE OTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME MOUNT AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MMOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASSES
Line_2909	YOU I DENTIFIDE THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUB ITS
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLE
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SOBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING ATEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CEMICALES T
Line_2917	IT'S AN NADITION PROBLUM
Line_2918	I'M I DON'T KNOW I'M SOARY
Line_2919	THE BACK CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASES WEIGHS MOR
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER IS AN I NO THAT QUASTIRON OP TO THE WATER
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A MIXTURE
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE THEY ARE EVERYTHING CEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL CEEP THEIR ON PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS A CREEN
Line_2927	THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURAE AND IT'S WARE TO A MARAL OBJECTS OR TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE THER TWO ALL MIX ORE
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING RAISANS AND MMNMS OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR ONM PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER
Line_2934	THEY ARE GETING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATTER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SANS STAID ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SOLT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TO CKEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAM
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SAL SOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE POWRT NEADS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE EOTHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	WE CALLED THAT A SAOLUTE
Line_2944	BECAUSE THE GREAP STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED IN THE OTHER AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	HA DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXURE BOTH OF THEM KEP THE SAME PROPERTY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE GREDIANT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE O A SOLUTE
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE
Line_2953	THE SOL ET THE SOLID SOL
Line_2954	OTE IS SWIE ONE INGREDA THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVENT
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURE
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LUSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY CEP THEIR SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NETHER THE WATER O THE SALT LUSES ANY M
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WAERL TO MAKE SOME CRYSTAL
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX STRAW AND THE SH STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF IT'S PRODICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX STR
Line_2963	FILLTER OUT THE SOLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2965	SAPORATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF A SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WEIY TO SEPARATE TH
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARND THAT THE WAY TO SEPARATE THE SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	R IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEI'R PROPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILALS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MA THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISOM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ALL PARNICAL SIZE IT'S FACAL THEN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	THE PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHON AS PARNICAL SIDE
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	POTICAL SIZE ANDMAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PARTICAL SIDE AND MAGNETISOM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOLES FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WEIGH WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETIDED IN
Line_2981	I NOTICE THAT NON OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS STAYDED ON TOP OF THE UMTHE FILLL WHEN THE OTHER THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY THING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED THE FILTER  BECAUSE THE STUFF STADED ON TOP
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BESS FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	IT DON'T GOW FARD BY
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE PAR
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PUPLE STUF
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORLL THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATIT IT IS
Line_2991	THE LIGHTRE ILOW SOLUTIONSS ARE U MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLEGRA POWDER WOULL TACE SMALL LIKE CREEM AND THE OTHER ONE WOLL TACE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRA
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UM ONE WITH LESS GRAY POWDERWE'LL TAST MORE LIKE WATDER
Line_2994	THE TAST IS NOT AS THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE A LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WAN MARTE
Line_2998	BEY MAERTE
Line_2999	BADD
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU COAN'T TEL IF IT'S MORE CONCEANT HAKATED IF IT'S DARK
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3003	M PARDICION WAS RAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHTD MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRACTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTID
Line_3006	BYE THEARE WEIGH LT
Line_3007	NHEUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRACTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS SOIS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	NUM THE ONE I'S THE MOST CONENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENT
Line_3009	H
Line_3010	WE LEARNED ABOUT SATEWAION
Line_3011	THE COLK IS LESS DENCSED THAN THE PANY AND THE PANY IS MORE DENCSED THAN THE COLE
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	IN THE SOLUTION EY WOULD THINK AND THIN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	U CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRACTID
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
Line_3016	THE MORTISONE WILL STINK TO THEBI
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WE'LL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE THAT'S LS ANCE WILL GO NTO TH
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYES AT THE DOR
Line_3019	THE ORDENCITY CAME THA THE ORDICITY BECAME THE SAME
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SONK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IND WITH THE LIGHTOONE
Line_3021	IT SAS THAT THE BLUME IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREIN HAS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TGRAMS THEN IT
Line_3022	SEE YOU THIRSE DY
Line_3023	UM WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTIN
Line_3024	IT'S FOLGY AND THIS IT'S OBBLANDED INTO
Line_3025	THEY ARE TWOS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP MEY
Line_3027	THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	TREEACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP MY
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN
Line_3031	THEY HAVE TO PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THEN LOOK AND MARGLE A
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FULL SCOOPS CICU CITID ACIT ACSID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF ESOM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING  ALUMIN SOME HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD AND THE WARE
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DCITYE'S STUFF
Line_3035	DENCITY YEAH AND CONSALE AND SATURRA
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUFF SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACHE THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBSITANT NUMBER AND
Line_3040	I'M DOING OSS UM
Line_3041	TIMICAL REACTIN
Line_3042	YEAHREI S
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDL IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLED THESE REACTANTS TAT
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CEMMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS MICSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM CE THE'RE SAME PROWDC
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW IT PLEASE HELP M
Line_3049	I DON'T H
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORA
Line_3051	ALL OF THEM MOLECUES AND THEYR DIFFERENT UM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UM
Line_3052	IT CAN BE SEPARARTED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE ERTH WILL ALWASE BE UNTERRTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPER R BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE COMFERENT BASON AMOUWNTS
Line_3055	THE L I THICIPS ARE FLOWTING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FARTHER
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CEMICAL REACTION  BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLBE
Line_3058	A CUMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	IT'S NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTING TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BBE WHICH MAKES THE CANNLICREACTION WHICH ADDS RUS TO THE
Line_3062	A CEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE CLOW STICK IS UM COMING FOLDED AND HATE
Line_3063	THE CLOWSD STICK IS WBEING IT GLOED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLED IT
Line_3064	YES THE MICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ILLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDCATES A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	CONSULVATION
Line_3066	A CMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPEND HERE BECAUSE NOFTHING IS HAPINING WHEN THE GRM TEST IS ADDED TO THE WAHE
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK THE CEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	INED ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CEM IF CEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FO O NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE U NOTI SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE U
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOWA
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKIENG APART
Line_3075	THE THE TRAIL MIXED HAS BEEN PULLED APPART FROM BEING  M
Line_3076	IT CAN YOU REPETE WHAT YOU
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FILTE
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULD ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT'S LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED
Line_3080	UM  WE CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPERES AND I GOES INTO THE MOLECUES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NO
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	H I ONES CENTENTCS
Line_3085	COULD HIT YOUR FACE WHY U SO
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3087	THE  SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPERE
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPERE AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT AS AFTER BEING MIXED WITH CHOULOF WATER
Line_3090	IT'S SOLVENT
Line_3091	EVEN THOW THE SALT DISAPPERES IT DIS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE UM
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	I CANM IE
Line_3095	WHOLLDING UP STIDS THERETHEARIN
Line_3096	THIS SALT DISAPPERED AND NO IT'S GOING INTO THE FILER
Line_3097	A SOLMA SHAN I MAKE PLAKE INTO GAT HE'S RATHER MORE THAN RIGHT
Line_3098	ANT IT MAKES DO GESS AND A SOLUTION NOR
Line_3099	THE CLITRIC AID DISAPPERED INTO THE WATER
Line_3100	WE CLULED THE NOIAN

Line_3108	THEY ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MOLTIPLE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY WOULD
Line_3109	BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE RUSH TO THE MIXTURE
Line_3111	THE GRAVEL'S TWO BIG TO FIT THROUGH USE

Line_3174	I SEE IN THE VINEGAR I SEE OCIGIN AND
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCROAGIENE AND H ATTUMS AND A VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WICH MEANS THEY RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT POWDERS

Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SOBSTANCEIS PORED INTO THE MIDALE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FASED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NO WITH KHE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BULB
Line_3190	IT STARTED FIING SO AND ONE IS FIING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE PK HADD RUSHT ON IT AT THE END OF THE ER
Line_3192	IT GUETS TURN GREAN TULL IS GRY
Line_3193	EEMICAL REACTION IXCURED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNES GREIN WITH THE TRIP OF CURRENT FLOW
Line_3194	IT IT HAD AC CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TURN
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE EECCHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER TURING PURPLE IT USE TO BE BLUE AND CLEER
Line_3196	I THINK THE RASTS COULS T DIS TURNING PUT THE WATERS TO NING PAPE

Line_3455	UM THEY HERE MAE BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEIVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR SHELLS IND SIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINEY PALM MY AND AN NOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIES
Line_3459	UH THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND ON THEM LIKE THE PAL MET HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS

Line_3469	ONE TWO GOES UP THE OTHER TWO GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LEANS
Line_3471	WHAT DOES WHAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE-BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_3473	TOD
Line_3474	IT'S ALL THE PLANTS ARING OUR SUN

Line_3478	THE INNER PONENTS ARE SUPER SMALL
Line_3479	WHE ARE ROTAING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVETY WE OULD TO SHU IT
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SICSTMS
Line_3481	ERTH LUGIDGE COMPUTORS CARES THE HUMAN BODDY AND THE UNEVERSE
Line_3482	IT IT SAS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS AND A ON'T
Line_3483	THEA SISTM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SISTOM
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOME
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPAN WITH THE INVOLVING THE SISTAOME
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY I LIGHT
Line_3487	CAUSE IT IS ON ERTH IT IS THE ERTH AND THAT IS ACIS
Line_3488	WE INTERACTING PARTS AND IN IT
Line_3489	I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS IN VOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN OTON HOUSES MOUTNS CLOULDS AND TREESE
Line_3492	THERE ARE EGO CISCIUMS AND I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMLE
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFFERC IT BROT UP THE ERT
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPROENT JUNGLES DEEIRTS BODES OF WATER AND ISE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	BS MEANS THAT IT SHOWES WHAT ANIMALES ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THAT
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THAT
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE CONSUMER OR IF THEY'RE TO A D COMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS AR SISTOMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS ORE A BACK MATERIAL
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALES LIKE THE SHORK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALES THAT ARE IN THE
Line_3502	CHURES CONCSUMERES AND DCOMPOSEORS
Line_3503	A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMAINS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISUMS THINGS TO BREATH AND EAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHES IN SE T WHITCH IS WHAT WE BREATH OUT AND THEY BREATH OUT AIR WHICH IS WHAT REBRETI
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR ON SOD
Line_3506	CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASCING
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINCOPE
Line_3509	IT IS A FOG HAIN OF MEANY DIFFERENT THIN
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SONE OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS ONE OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	THEY ARBEFORE ONLY EATS PLANMS
Line_3512	THINK THAT AN OMINEMORE MEANS THAT YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND THE ANIMLES
Line_3513	I THINK A D COMPOSOR IS U
Line_3514	DED PLANTS AND ANIL
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER UM THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE ERTH THAT HELPS IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS A A COMPOSER
Line_3517	A CARNOVOI
Line_3518	IT IS A HUR ERB
Line_3519	IT'S A D COMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE ERTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THE DED WEAIVES AND THE NUSE PAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOSED
Line_3521	FORMS U D COMPOSIT AND MAKE IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THITUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF A BIG UM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIRE OWN FROUOD ODA
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PIN CON
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SORVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BUG THE BERD THE HOCK THE SNAK THE BUNY AND THE SOWLMANER
Line_3531	A D COMPOSEOR IT'S DED PLANTS AND AN
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DED PLANTS AND ANIMLES
Line_3533	THERE WILL GOTHE MUSHROMES
Line_3534	YEAHA CONSUMER
Line_3535	A D COMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING MHE WHATUM
Line_3537	BEING AND ERIOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NO PLATAM
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVOR BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NETHER A HEERBFOR OR A COMAROR OR A OM THE
Line_3541	BAC TERIAL IS A DCOMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOUSE IS A ERB
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOCX IS A CURON OF WAE
Line_3544	THEY ARE WARENTED THEY ARE DCOMPOSORS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDONS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	THE RED FORM IS A DCOMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDONS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ITUMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMLE CRACKER IS NOT UM I DON'T KNOW ACTUWALLY SO YOU TELL MEY
Line_3550	ESC IS A FONGIS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN IT'S DOORMENT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SOME IGHT WATER AND SWAIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PIXTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WEIND AND IF THE WIND IS TWO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIVE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SONAND THE PLANT NEADS SOMELIGHT TO SORVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEADS NU TRANS TO SORVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SERVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR ON SOD BY FOTO CIMFICIS
Line_3561	TWO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANTS WEILLP
Line_3562	PLANTS NEEDE SUN SERVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WILT
Line_3563	THE PLANS HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO D
Line_3564	THE PLANT GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIVE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEAD EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AR AND WATER TO SERVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIVE AND WILL'T
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WERENT THERE THEN SOME ANIMLES WOULD HAVE NOFTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UMS AND THE DIJESCTIVE M
Line_3570	THE DOG IS STITTING THE B IS CONLECTING TALL AND AND THE THE GES ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING TOLE AND AND IT IS BRINGING THE POL AND BACK TO THE HOCOME
Line_3572	IT SHOWES THAT ONE B ONS OTHER BES TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEAD MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTL SNAKE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DORBLE RANG THE DOLG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT E SMASS IT'S MASTER
Line_3575	IT SLAPS THE MASKETO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE D THE DORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULAS IS THAT THE DOG BARTS
Line_3577	THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINEL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND
Line_3579	THE NERVES CSISCTM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTALED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHIN
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMELES AND THEY ALL HAVE DIJESTIVE IITHEM
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN ABA ABA TACHIR
Line_3583	THE SCUNK IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DIFFENDIT SELFF FROM PRADUCTOR
Line_3585	IT'S ADDAT ONE OF IT'S ABDAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHELLW BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SORVIVE FROM PRODCT
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMLS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS IT'S POAWDEREN ON IT'S BACK AND ON IT'S BODDY SO THAT IT CAN BE CARALLLASED IN WITH THES OP TPE
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEPED FEET
Line_3589	NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS SOTAT CAN FLIRE
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE POATER  AWAY
Line_3592	THE STICK HAS AN ABJATATION ABOUT IT'S RATTL AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTL IS THE ADDAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTL SCARES THE GIRL WHICH ITS IT'S TIM
Line_3594	IT IS INVOLVING A SCUNK WHITCH IS FOUODH FOR THE WOOLF
Line_3595	AN ADDAPTACHION THAT THE SCUNK AS IS THE SMELL THAT MAKES THE SCUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SNELL A
Line_3596	UM UM WHAT DOES CLASCSIFIYE ME
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BERDS ARE FLING IN THE RONE AND THE FRUNT IS THE LITER
Line_3598	IT'S BEHAVIAURE IS PLAIING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CACHING THE DISC
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY NOW HOW TO CAUCH THE FR WHEN THE
Line_3600	NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPENS
Line_3601	IT IS AI NOND WAREND BEHAVIOUR
Line_3602	THAT IS A WARANED BE HAVIER
Line_3603	THIS IS THEY NO'T WARENT BEHAVIR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT EMEADIEATLY WHEN THEY'RE BORN
Line_3604	THEY CATCH THE OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE SPLES ARE DIFFERENT THEN UM THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY UM ELLS IND SIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINK
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUGE

Line_3610	MANY BLUE SCALLS THAT LOOK LIKE SCIN
Line_3611	SINSALS HELP YOUR BODY RE HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODDY THAN EAST DOUS
Line_3613	THE BUTTER FLY HAS FELLS IN ITS BODY AND TN IT SWINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTER FLY SIJUESTIVE SISTOM AND THE HUMAN DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE OUR DIJUESTIIUM
Line_3616	IIT'S  SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTIANTS AND THE LUMG
Line_3617	THE JDIJUCTITUM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOD SO THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET  BAER OUTO OUR BODDY

Line_3749	THERECSPITORYS ANDUM IS RESPONCSIBL REETING OFCR INER BODDY AND CARBONOCXID OUT
Line_3750	THEY ARE GOING IN AND OUT THE LUM AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OCIGION THER SELES AND GETTING CARBONOSIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES IN AND FILTERES THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE DM
Line_3753	THERE TWO EBZACT CARY AIR AND BRANCH OFF TO THE TREA D GO DP INTO THE DS AND THEY PERNETCHAL IR SAC

Line_3756	EACH THE AR SAX OR A BOLT IE
Line_3757	CHE THE UM
Line_3758	THE CIRCULAR TORYIS
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE FOULL CSISTOM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRYVE UPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BISC FIERE THEY ARE UL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BISC FIERE MAKING IT UN ANTIR SISTOM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SICTUMS AND MOLECULES AND D STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SARY I'M ON THE RONG UM IT WEP SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SHOURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE ESOR ESED PARTICALES
Line_3767	CAN YO HOLT ME WITH THAT UM NOT TO LHERE
Line_3768	MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUIGHT AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT UM PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SERVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEEAD FOD AND WATER TO SERVIVE
Line_3770	SONLIGHT AND WATER AND MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF FERNALLISER
Line_3771	DEFFINEATLY DEFFANATLY DEFFNEANTLY DAT'S ORT NOT A REALLY
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANTS ALSO NEAD AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEADS SOME LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE FOTO CIMFICIS TO GET THE IT FROM I MEAN TO START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS EOR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SOW
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3777	THAT  HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY CELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG CELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE UM EST IS MADE UP OF ONE SLOW THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIANS OF SOUTH
Line_3779	IT'S A BUTTER FLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN INTIRE SISTOM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DI JUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	SELS AND ORGANISUMS AND SISTUMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SELLS AND ONE SISTM
Line_3784	PINK MUSLES  TIN THE LEAG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSSLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSSL CSELL
Line_3786	THOSE RE THE BRAIN CELLS AND THE BRAIN ORGANISED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AND THE EST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE SILE
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMEULAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTER FLYS NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BONCH OF SELES AND WE BOTH HAVE SISTUMS AND ORGANISUMS IN SIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISUM S AND SISTUM S IN SIDE OF ARE BODDIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOED THROUGH IT T ALL THE WEIY THROUGH YOUR BODDY IN THE FRONT  IN THE TOP FRUNT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOD DOWN INTO THE STUMICK SO THAT YOU CAN DIJEST THE FOD
Line_3793	TO DIJEST THE FOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FODES ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M REALY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SARND ME HAVE TO DEH BUT HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NO OR WET WET NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DID BREAEITH WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIVE
Line_3797	I THINK IT ZH THE DIEGRAM SO TBECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE  OLVIUALLYAUND YEAH THE LVIOLYEACH
Line_3799	OT  MISS LIKE HOW ARE YEOU
Line_3800	I THINK IT'S IN THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GASS TEEO TWO AND OH TWO
Line_3802	EY END B THE MOUTH AND THE NOES
Line_3803	IT
Line_3804	I'M NOT TOTALLY SHURE CAN YOU HELP MEY WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE CACK TWO ERLLIER
Line_3806	UM SISTUMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I THINK THAT IS A WHART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW MEE HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HART AND THE VAINS CONNECT INTO THE HART
Line_3809	EACH TWO OW AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLUD CELLS ARE TRAVELLING THROUGH ARE THE VAINS AND THE BLUE PART IS SCINCELLS
Line_3811	THAT'S THE BLUE PART I SEL OUR SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAPILLARY
Line_3812	IT LETTING AN BLUD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLUD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLUD AROUND AND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIR BODDY
Line_3814	THE BLUD VESSLES THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLUD AROUND
Line_3815	THE PUMS SPLUD AROUND THE BODDY
Line_3816	ELL IS THE CIRCULATTORY SISTUM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING WT THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS IN SIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASSIES SO THAT WE CAN SERVIVE
Line_3819	UM THE RUNS DEFFINEATLY THE LUMGS
Line_3820	THE LUMGS
Line_3821	THROUG AAN BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TFRHEA
Line_3823	THE RATTL SNAKES RATTL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAD HE HE GOT WERIED WHEN HE SAW THE  SPILL OVER SO IT STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SOPRISE
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT USE THE QUIGHT FAT MAN
Line_3826	UM I'M NOT SHURE CAN YOU HELP MEY ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SICTMS IN SIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTECES SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT IM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WEDND FEET
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HAS TEETH SO IT CAN RIP OPEN HIS PRAY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FORT AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF KESE ALWAYSE FOLLOWS ONE GOST BUT THEY TAKE TURONS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEYRE MAIN BEHAVOUR
Line_3833	UHM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WETHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOLG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT NOES WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW UP
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BERNED SO THEY HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURTS SO THEY JUST WANNO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THEY REALLY HURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIUR BECAUSE ALL REE FLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THEYRE SPETSHIAL RE FLEXIS
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LARNING ABOUT WETHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL IN ACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'SHE SISTOM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO A ISTM I IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODDY THAT HAS CISTOMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AND INACTING OF MOVING POWDES TOGETHER MAKANG A COP
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POWD MOVMENT TWOURK TOGETHER
Line_3843	IS BECAUSE IT HAS IN ACTING POWRS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SISTAOM
Line_3844	THE HOUT AND THE IS
Line_3845	THE IS MOVING THA POUTCH MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES ST
Line_3846	YEA HAS TO MOVE AND TO ALL WORK TOGETHER
Line_3847	I SEE IT'S A MOUNT ON LOOKING THINGE AND IT HAS FORCIS STUMBS
Line_3848	U H FOLLE
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLAINTS AND BUTTHEY HAVE NO PLINTS AND AMINALS
Line_3850	ECO SISTOM LIKE IS SOARES
Line_3851	THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR AMINALMS AND THE AMINA
Line_3852	BT THE EMMINALS PROSSESS THOUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHER ERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ALL PRODUCING A SUP ISTIM OF THE OR
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STUM
Line_3855	IS A SISTM WITH INNACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SISTAM
Line_3856	IT IS A BANCHIPND  ACTUILY POST WORLPS THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIKE ST
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE I NORMED ABOUT MOVIN THE O
Line_3858	IS IT HAS BUNCH OF SUP SISTOMS WE NEATDOT MAKE ONE
Line_3859	I  THINK THAT THESE ARE SOPTUMS
Line_3860	STICICUM BECAUSE IT'S AING AND DON'T ACTIM POWDET MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT WANTS OA DINE THE BIS
Line_3862	GOOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS UM
Line_3866	IT'S BOTDY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBITUM
Line_3868	A HAR AKIN NEY AND
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S UM A BIGGER PART OF   SOMSUB ICTM
Line_3870	THEY ARE R
Line_3871	OIO FER IS ALLIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN EGO CSISTOM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S UM LAND AND OHIRN
Line_3874	THE AROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE E LIKE OR WHAND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TWO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS TAN THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS TENED THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD MEY THAT IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I THINK THAT WARM PLACES WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPPORATED OFF THE CIRCUISS
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE CIRCUICS CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO SHRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DISCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRCUISS AREA AFFACTS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATEES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE CIRCUIS IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SOPRISED ME QUIGHT YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PETALS EVAPORATE QUIGHT A LOT MORE AND THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SIL AND THE ROC OR GRAVERL
Line_3888	THE WATER AND THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN HA GASS STICKD
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP RI WATER DROP LITS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BLUM CUP IS COLDER THAN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN SEROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER WL TO HELP US LIFT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	MARNEY YOU'E AREDY ASCK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	ATSEL CAME ORNEY
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING WHAISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT TER OR LAITER THIS ER
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICIME MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WARE AND IT WAS PRTY CLLL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHY IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HAVIER THAND PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT MMATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST ALO EASIER TO YOUTH
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BOCKUITS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WEARE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE STAIL AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_3907	THE TE INGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH AND THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE STAIL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGARING OUT HOW HEAVY IT STO MIK SHURE THEY ARE CRACTD
Line_3911	WILL HELP YOU KNO THE EXACT THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED I AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SOURTD A GUESSED
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WELL BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST WANT US TO BE GOOD ESTIMETERS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE IT WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORCE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORCKE AND HAN IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROWB HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE METRIC CISTOM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT A MIX SURE IT RIGHT
Line_3922	YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHINGS BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND CONNG A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR HE WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTH WIZE ITS GOING TO GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SHURE IT  SOME TIMES YOU'RE NEXT THINK ABOUT IT UH I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE MTHE STAL YEAH THE STEAL YEAH
Line_3927	NO E DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE CAN'T HOW MANY BE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM  THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WEAIST THE PLASTER CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	AUH NEBLE A METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	M NOW NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	THIS PUM OH SAREY
Line_3933	NOH WOULD BE FIVE PETERS
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLA STICK WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	UH SARY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHTS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST ETHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIDE
Line_3939	ONE GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I IT I WAS MOST SOPRIZED THAT I FI FICK ARED OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHIY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY BAINK AND YOU WOULD'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME FLS PAPER CLIP
Line_3943	TEN
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DETH WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLCATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
Line_3946	UM FOBCICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRITY USFUL BUT THEY CAN BE US FUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THINGS
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NOW NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NO
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T KILAR MANY ET NO
Line_3952	UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PERSCE DODNTYEAH EVERYONE ELSE I
Line_3953	UH WE CLURED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO I DON'T WEIHT
Line_3955	UH NOT YET NO I DON'T RE MEMBER THAT
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T WANLY NUMBER US USING THI CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING  BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH
Line_3958	AH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAT TAKE THESE OFF O
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLAR IM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH I JUST THIRTY EIGHT PIECES ONE I WALKED EYEAH
Line_3962	YEAH IT WON'T IT BETTER  I WON'T HAVE  AND NOUA CLITTLE OU ALI D NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO I DON'T REALLY KNOW M
Line_3965	TWENTY LII MITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T NO MAYBE JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAD UHM WE SHOULD DISCRIVE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINING TO  AT THE OFF SO EH
Line_3967	T YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBEBECAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE
Line_3969	AVENO GRASAING THAT IT' MOST PYEAH
Line_3970	HE IMNO THE ANSWER TO SUS
Line_3971	IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOUE UH YOU SHOULD ALLWAS TRY OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWISE
Line_3972	UM YEAS WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY GOT A L BETTER
Line_3973	UM IS LEARN THAT
Line_3974	YEAH REPEATING THING  IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONES AND I FORGHAT M SHO WAS AL WAISE MS OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE A GREAYS OUM
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS AN NOTHER RY FOUR ES
Line_3977	GRAMS ABOUT AS MUCH AS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	AN BUT HE THOUTD IT WAS SIXTY TWO ELAGRAMS AND HE THOUT T IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A HA GRAM IS JUST ABOUT AS WHEN TO LUSER PAPER CLIP
Line_3980	YES TO WAISE AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	M YEAH THOUSAND
Line_3982	A MILAGRAM IS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGHS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	M EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BEE ONE LINE
Line_3984	M THE NAKE LES IND THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM USE THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRAT THIT WOULDN'T BE SORT IT SLANTED
Line_3986	M CA BUT I WANT TO SEE THEM TO RACT TI THIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHT MORE
Line_3988	WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM S  ACTUALLY ARTY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED BEAN SE QUM
Line_3991	UM THAT THE NET ORD THE BEEMS EQUALES A GRAM
Line_3992	YEAH THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THAER
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WAS TENUGFF
Line_3994	A HUNDRED GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM  SEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP UM ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TWO SMAE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT JUSE THE INDIRACTIVE TIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSIS
Line_4000	AND WE DID WA WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	ITHAT THING IS GOING UH HE CLIPSOND GOES UP
Line_4002	READING RIGHTING A MASS MANLY
Line_4003	Y H  SLICH IS READ
Line_4004	M WELL YEAH WE MEASURED OURD DISC WITH THE SCRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING ON MINEBIT
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE DISCS WITH THREE BY TWO NINE WAS TWEN NINE TENTH ACH TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DISXIG FORTY AND ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSED TWO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NIN TEN I MEAN TWO AR NINE TENSERS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE PEINT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	M UH PA
Line_4011	MIS NO WELL YEAH WE DID WE  GOT BLTER SYMAS
Line_4012	UM T A METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR NAMES THEY ARE
Line_4013	NO IT T DOESN'T COLOR IT AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THO I I 'VE NO IDEA OR YOU MIGHT COLOR IT SOME TIME
Line_4015	THOSE THING WAS MARKS CENTIMETERS OKAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDRED CENTIMETER ANT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER INWALLWAY I DON'T
Line_4017	NO WE JUSTST WE JUSTST ARTED CUING IT OUT AND BLLUED IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	OONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALS ONE TEEN E CENT TO BE
Line_4019	THAT'S WTHE RED LIN IS ONE CENTIMETERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR SIX ENTYAND TEN IN THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHA DOS SCUALONE MILLMETER
Line_4022	O CAN
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS THE I DON'T WANT O GET RED OF
Line_4024	OKAY HIT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT T
Line_4025	I NO BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FOR I S
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGER OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LMETERS NOW CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPAR VILES M YEAH H THAT'S LIKE WHAT ARMS WERE
Line_4029	UM I L I LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUALLED TO ONE LITER I NO
Line_4030	MNOT I I NO LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT'S IT WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I YU CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	MEBEAH L THI SAT'S THING IS A KILLITER I THINK
Line_4032	LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	AN NEAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UM YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GRUM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLLITER TRAVELI EQUALS A MILLLY A MILLMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD SINE THE CUPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEN AND YOU WOULD POUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	WEL WEA I WANTNAN TO GRASURATES YEAH
Line_4040	YEAH YOU COULDN'T DO THOSE THIGS SOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	HI THINK THIS IS ON BACK CURENTS THAT'S WAY SOMETHING
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DON IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YEAT THE TE C HAS ONLY ST IN US WE DUSD THE FI AL THING AND THEN THE T C HAS ALSO SHOEDUS BUT
Line_4046	CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE AND THE UM S THE THING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PIOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF VILS AND SOME PIEPELE SIENCE A A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LETER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE VOLIUM OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WITS OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	M WE OU SAE I OA PINK ATAMSA NEARES TING YOU BY THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLIUM IT'S THE AMOUNT TOF IT THE AMOUNT TO THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT THE IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPS AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH HEIGHT WITH DEPS AND LENGTS
Line_4055	BEFOR THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORS HEARY OE NO NOT THE ONE WA DID WE DO THIS WORK
Line_4056	MAT'S A HUNDRED THERE'S A THOUSAND OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOL OF IT
Line_4057	WIGH PS AND WA O TEN
Line_4058	THE UM PROPABLY THE T S THE THIS ONE OHAS THE ORS
Line_4059	I W UH MEAN THE PROBALY THA HUNDREDS
Line_4060	M WHAT'S UE IN  A YEAH M YEAH UM RBLIKE IS ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	M E MOTOLIP WHAT WHAT  APERCHING  WHAT WE 'E STIKING WHAT WEREYOUE SAYING ABSE
Line_4062	UM TROP TRABBELY MILLLITERS
Line_4063	BUT I WAND TO SEE THE FIRST I ONE MI DON'T FORGET THE U
Line_4064	N WE WERE  USING VILES WE USED VILES A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH  WELL NO WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
Line_4066	M NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LIN A B LIN A S LAND A D LINE
Line_4067	THE SREN IS A THING THAT SO IT SUCKS UFF WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THEY ARE THE YOUS STUCKED UP
Line_4068	WELL BY THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH WIT'S NO
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS THE LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BE FOR WINTER BREAKE
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VILES WERE DIFFERENT YEAH S MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADOUATED SO ANDTHERE IS WT THOST ONE'S HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER
Line_4074	UM HOW MANY OH THERE'S A SOUSPEND IN THAT BIG THING AND TEN ONE LITER
Line_4075	FOL IT'S THE SOA CAND THE INTERACTIE SODA CANI I LIKET THE INTERACTIVE ONES OH
Line_4076	NO BUT WELL A HUNDRED NOATY THAT LOOKS NEE IT FWLS
Line_4077	TWO HUNDRED MILLLITER GRADURATED SILMETERS EQULE WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WAT DOESIT COLD IS WHAT I'S ONDERING O IT TRAY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONES WIZED IF YOU FLATDAN THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL AND THE HESE STOUWN STANDS FOUR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER AND ENT I IT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_4082	WE WHAT YOU DO AS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHER THE WATER IS LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LINED UP TO ITS ERE
Line_4083	W WEN GE
Line_4084	UM UM  NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND THAT'S SAIL MAN TO REACT TO THE SINE IT I ONES
Line_4086	SOLANT TORACTR WATER
Line_4087	IT'S INTORACTIVE OR AN SODAH WELLEXLY IT'S ON SODA
Line_4088	BUT I WAN'T AO VIEATAKE MY CONSALS
Line_4089	YEM L U NO FHOW HERAND
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WHEN NOT WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER

Line_4093	UH I WA I MEAN IF YOU CAME ON TO SOMEONE HO WORKED OUT A GROHE STOR INSTIDE YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIP S
Line_4095	OF APPLES PROBLY I  YOU PROBABLY WOULDE A USE SMALL AN TAT HOU COULD  USE BIG
Line_4096	POUWNS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	M SO IT  SAY W ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTING ONE POUND  SOME THINGS
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED AT THE UM UNED ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UME
Line_4100	AND PLASTRIC TIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	AR AR GOOD TO USE SHURE MEASURE I MEAN WEIGTHT
Line_4102	IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE SHE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHET USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	M  ONE WOULD BE SMALLER AND ONE WOULD BE HOUGE
Line_4106	BHE ABOUT THAT BIG AND ROUMPA WOULD BE S
Line_4107	WITH THE ROL AR ER TAPE MEASURE
Line_4108	WILC MOSTRELL MOSTRVILLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAY LINGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A RILAR WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURE BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULD'T USE MET METERS
Line_4112	I NOWICE A HUNDRED A HUNDRED OF A CENTIMETER
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS SHURE AND A METER
Line_4114	MY DADD MEASURES WIT UM BILLS BILDING SO HE USES HOW LOT OF I STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSETHEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A A KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE ERL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GOW  HOW YOU PUT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD  WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THE  BECAUSE THE TYME
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOOLD UM MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	A THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETER IS LONG
Line_4121	LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURE IT MEASURES WHAT IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE GUESS  MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPETERS DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOARS AR UM CAN BE
Line_4126	WIGDHER THAN TABE THAN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UM ROMERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGOW BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WEELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAYGHED UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WOUBBLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE THE CORECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERSSO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS I CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	HICOD
Line_4135	YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN U MILLIMETERS AND A CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T  MEAN NO
Line_4138	NO ARALLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPUNGHES SPUNGHES THEY SLK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEEN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS ARE MEASURING TOLS
Line_4141	IN THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURED OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU'RE LOOKIN FOR UNTIELL IT'S PERECTLY LEVELD
Line_4143	SO SAME WHA I PUT THE DRY SPUNGE OND IT'S LIKE THIS AND N N OTHER GAM TEN A NOTHER GAM THEN AN OTHER GAM AND NO IT'S PRITY BALENCE RIGHT
Line_4144	YOOU YOU PICK OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AN C IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SOBTRACT FROM THE WEITHT SPUNGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPUNGE YOU WEIHT UNTIEL IT'S FULL AND YOU NOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MECY M FOR UM
Line_4147	UM  HOW MUCH WATER IS AND THAT UA DRY SPUNGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS AND ONE BY ONE AGEN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THMK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TWO IF IT'S LIKE AND HEAV IDOM YOU CAN GO BY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU TAKE UP FIVE AND THEN AE OTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TWO HEAVIER ON YOU PUT IN THE E N OTHER FIVE YOULD TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	THE DRY SPUNGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN REAMILLIAR A NUMBER
Line_4153	UM THEE
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHTS
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGH TWENTY FOR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	MM IN THE N THE DRY SPUNGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	M IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UN EVEANLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIGGE SPUNGE SHOULD HUN MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY NO
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PIXTURE OF IT
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG AND SOLT IT'S GOING O BE JATICK
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO I DEA WREALL YOU HAVE NO I DEA
Line_4166	THEEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN YOU WARNCH
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAYBE TO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH I MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4169	MAYB A LITTLE HEAVY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISSPOSAL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	A MILLEG I THINK THEIRE THESE THINGS CALLED MILLEGRAMS I CANT REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILEGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHUN WE METER IT'S LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LANXS FRUM
Line_4175	TAXIS FROM HERE IT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS A MASING YEAH AH
Line_4177	DRY SPUNGESLM
Line_4178	AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESSING
Line_4179	NOT REALLY YOU JUST LOOK ATIT AND GUESS
Line_4180	HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WO
Line_4181	THE THING TESTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPOUNGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	M E CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WELL M
Line_4185	LEVELE MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BAR IS LINED UP WITH THIS ST
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMTY WATER BATL OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	IF M I DON'T  PUT AN OTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE IF ANEALLY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IND IT
Line_4190	IT THE THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED IN TO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER AND THIS FAN
Line_4192	UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCUITS
Line_4193	I THOUT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	A KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBEE LHAT TOP COMPOTOR A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WEIGHT THAT OUNCIS SIXTY OUNC IS A POWND
Line_4198	THEN BY DFLUMY HOM HE SHE USED HAVE A JOB IND CALEFORNEA
Line_4199	UM WELL THEN WE HAD THE I CAN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED
Line_4200	YEAH IT'S IT SAD LIKE FIVE TIMES FIFTEEN TWENTY UP TO FIFTY T YOU
Line_4201	UM IT WASN'T THE MOST EFISENT WAY BUT STEEL IT WAS THE BEST YOU COULD GET WITH SCOL STUFF
Line_4202	UM USING SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFICK LIKE UM
Line_4203	WE WE HAD TWENTY SIVE AND OUR GRADGUWAITED SILANDER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED AND THE CONTAINER
Line_4204	UM WEELL
Line_4205	WELL  CAN REALLY TELL THA DIFFERENTS
Line_4206	WELL YEAH WHAL YOU SHOULD WAS WHAT HAS BEND I JUST CAN REPEATE
Line_4207	THIS UM OWER CONTAINER DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ONE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED STUFF LIKE THAT

Line_4413	THAT EY HAD  WATER UM SO NO WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
Line_4414	M THEA WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WRIGHT THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WHAT NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINKD UP YEAH
Line_4417	UHM MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CAMS AND HOW MUCH WATER COULD TAK
Line_4418	UM  LIKE
Line_4419	UHM MY I DON'T MEAN MEMER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	FIE LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO IT COULDN'T DROP THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNO WHITCH NUMBER
Line_4422	I DON'T KNOW WE JUST DID THAT
Line_4423	YEAH HH

Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THEY IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT  NOT ALL STRAWS AR THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	OR THEY SOME OF THEM WERE SMR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE PUT IT OUT THM WE COULD WELL UM ONCE WE PUT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WEE
Line_4440	UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH BUT UM WEE
Line_4442	MEASURED UM THEU BOOK SHELES
Line_4443	BECAUSE TND PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN'T THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE CLOSE THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO ER
Line_4444	M H NO
Line_4445	WELL UHM LIKE OUR SEAD WE TRID TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WEILL ONE ENCH SIX AND TWO
Line_4446	I MEAN A NO
Line_4447	IT'S ALWAYSE THE SAME IT NEVER CHANGEES
Line_4448	BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE A LITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT AND THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
Line_4449	IT WAS NON I MEAN THREE MM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINTY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4451	IT'S NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STANDARD THEUND OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT  EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAMS
Line_4455	LIKE ICA THISE WERE LIKE THE COUBS THE ONE AND THE FIVE
Line_4456	UM EAH IT'S DIVIDED BY
Line_4457	YES THE THE CHIP
Line_4458	YES DUERIM THAERAT RESULTS WORE IS
Line_4459	YEAH M LIKE THAT BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOME TIMES
Line_4461	I UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CUBS JUST USE PAPER CLIPS INSTAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL IN TO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRIDED TO GET WITH OUR HOUR GRAMS WE TRIDED TO GET
Line_4464	IN STAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL THOSE BULKS WE COULD JUST USE
Line_4465	THE THATAT TEN A
Line_4466	THAT TEN AND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR SING THE THE WHOCKS THA WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	UM THE KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TRNS DO IND  SO IT TOOK A LONGER ONE SO JUST ONE PERSON
Line_4470	YEAH AND ONE TIME IT ONA'S LIKE HAT SEVEN THEN IT WAS TAT SIX THN IT WAS TAT SEVEN THEN IT WAS HAT EAIGHT THENIT WAS THAT SIX YEAH IT WAS FRED
Line_4471	YEAH YEAH UM MAYBE BECAUSE
Line_4472	BECAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM
Line_4473	UHM UH UM MAYBE BECAUSE WE CAN TELL IT SO WELL THEN
Line_4474	UM JUST KEEP IT IN ONE SPOT
Line_4475	WE UM
Line_4476	YEAH YEAH AND THEN OUR TEEACHER SHE ONLY MSED UP UM A LESS TO
Line_4477	UM YES EXCEPT WE DIDN'T LIKE TO COLD MI WE JUST SIDE IT IN THE WATER
Line_4478	HYEAH
Line_4479	YEES  LAST YEAH
Line_4480	THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN END IT AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN US
Line_4481	UM WELL EAM
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FOUL CRUM AND THE BALANCED
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT IT'S LIKE QWIBLBY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE YEAH BIG WHEN YOU CALLST A GRAM
Line_4486	YOU'RE WOKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT
Line_4487	YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH WFIRST I HOLD IN MY HANDS AND I WEIGH THEN YOU PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USED
Line_4490	M M M THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL I NO
Line_4491	YEAH FH YEAH
Line_4492	UM I'M A SHURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WIGH NOT ALL THE WAIGH
Line_4494	M MNOT A FHERECLY
Line_4495	YEAH  ONE MILLIS
Line_4496	M ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT IT JUST FLIPED UP M
Line_4498	I THINK IT' JUST IT'S TRYING TO TRICK US BUT IF YOU JUST DID THAT W YOU AT ARALY DID THAT
Line_4499	HOH WELL THEN YOU PROBLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWISE
Line_4500	TAT'STO THAT'S UR UM
Line_4501	THE LI'ME WELL UHM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FL IT WOULD BE O
Line_4502	YEAH IT CAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK IT COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS
Line_4503	WEL BECAUSE THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLYUNLESS ONE IS WIDDER
Line_4504	REALLY  YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS ANDPLASTIC TIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCAIEL THING WE OULD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AND WIT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD OU PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LOOK ON EVENW
Line_4507	IT UM THERE IS MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WARE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THEN IT WOULD
Line_4508	HOLPS UM
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TWO
Line_4510	MAEAH AND E
Line_4511	TO CAUED A HUNDRED I NOW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TO GETHER HOWMANY GRAMS AND THEN WILD GO TO BAT IT'S FLOWTEN IT'S FLOWTING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND SHE
Line_4513	TTHAT WOULD BE PROPBLY PROPBLY WOULD EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CURRES AND GO OSOM
Line_4516	FOKAY BYE-BYE
Line_4517	UMH YEAH
Line_4518	HI M
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SILKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHED IT PUT ANOTHER PUT  THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPUNGE STIMETE  DID NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	I FOR GOT WHAT SOLKED UP ALL S WATERS IT COULD THEN WE WEIGHED IT AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIX TEEN GRAMS
Line_4526	TO A CLEEN BECAUSE IH SHO AS WHIGHT AND WITH DIRTY WATER WOULD EXSOURBD THE DIRTY WATER MM
Line_4527	NO ONE THEN I NO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMTY CUPS CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	THIT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
Line_4530	IT HLTS COAL ASE YOU'LL NOISE HAVE THE TOP OF THAT EGEN TOP THE SPURL
Line_4531	A KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND EVERY KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNURED UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED  FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMALE GRAM SO A KILOGRAM IS PROPLY GOND TO BE IT IS HEAVY AIS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS OR TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT WODN'T WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THE STALE HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER IS A  PICHERE'S AS HEAVY AS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOGRAM PLAUS ONE ELL OH THE WATER LITERS
Line_4541	YEAH THIS MIS DUL ICE FUNY PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE U GOT THE SPUNGE WE MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WIGHT SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPOUNGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WEE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOR FIVE SIXS
Line_4545	N IT'S FIVE AND THEN EXS ONE THEN
Line_4546	IT WILL INSTEAD OF ALWASE HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THEY CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALLED OUT SO  FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS IT CAN  AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THEN SHOULD BE SIX TEEN MAKE UP  THE WATER
Line_4550	WEELL UM THERE'S ARLOCK AIRUH LOCKUIT IN SIDE OF IM
Line_4551	AND YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FOULL OF AIR
Line_4552	UH THERE IS SUHN YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER THSE WATERS HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY AR LOKE ALL THE ER LOCIS GOE ALLEWAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	M IF YOU ACTUALLY WEIGHT BETSE IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	Y SO YOU CAN'T GO BACK UP THE HERS
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT CEP WITH THE WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCAIL AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FROUTS YOUR VECHTABLES AND
Line_4559	PUT  THE SCAIL IN WAYSED
Line_4560	YE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPERS AND WE HAVE BAND YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4561	SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOL SAING THIING WHAH HOW THE SISTOM LOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SICSTAM BECAUSE THE PROPELLAR IS SPINING AROUND
Line_4563	I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	TH IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GIN THEY HAVE TO PUT IN A GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DUM THEY CAN BREAK
Line_4565	THESE OBJRECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROPGOS AND SEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BASIS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BALNSES OFF
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING TH AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MIXI A PER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNCSES OFF AND IT HOLEDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT A BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HEIGHT BECAUSE THE STIT CAN BREAK
Line_4571	AND WE THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEING HOW FAR E GOS MAYBE
Line_4572	YOU WUH THE HEAVIER BLB BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UM DO HA SMALLAR STICK AND TO SEE IF YOU CAN DO THACT TO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT WHOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEING THE LITTLE THE BLACK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOTHS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTING PANALLUMS IN THE BOTHS AND SEEING HOW MANY PANALLIUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOTH
Line_4577	UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PAGNICK IN THEM
Line_4578	WEE
Line_4579	YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF LIGHE BULBS YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I BILT MINE OUT OF PAN OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTING PANES IN IT OR WAHER
Line_4582	I DISSCOVERED THAT THE BULB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PANILLAM SM AND THE LITTLE BULB
Line_4583	WHAY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT KNUMBER OF PANECES BECAUSE THEY COT IT THEM SHORTER R LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND SE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHURE DIST ONE COULD HAVE EIT
Line_4585	I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEING HOW FAST THE AIR PINE COULD FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIR PLAN FLIY
Line_4588	I THINK THEAT THINGS THAT I AM POINING WHEN YOU'RE FYING YOUR PLAING IXZ THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WHEN ILING A LOT AND THAT YOU'R PROPELLEAR SPINGE
Line_4589	I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECANTD ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DOWN AND IF FI GOES UP IT' GOING TO GO ABAT DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAT
Line_4590	BUT IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TWO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PRPELLAR THE STRING IS MIKING UP BALANCI AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE PERPLE CHIPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLAR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLEAR SPIN
Line_4593	O CACE AHOW MANY SPANE IT TAKE SPANS ARE FORTY FIVE SPANS  MAYDE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLARS SPIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIVER ROUND THE WATERM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONE STTING UP TO MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
Line_4597	ALL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NIE STLKING TO YOU MARNEY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION WE STD ON THE EXAXICIS THE PENSUL IN LENGTH JUST THE PANDLUM LIKE AND NOFTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAM FOR PRODUCTING WHAT'S FOR TEN THE PANGIULOM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETERS SWITING WOULD BE A TEINTY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST  YOU COULD TEST YOUR PRODUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT SHURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PANGULUM FICS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THE PANGULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORE A PUNGULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PANULUMS AND BOTHS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PANES IT COULD CARRY WITH OUT SINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHOCK A PANY AT THE BILL AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPRED THEM EVENLY YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM IN RANSUM LY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANSUMLY YOUR BOTH WILL TIP OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE ABOUT S COULD 'VE BEEN REALLY WIDZE AND THE OTHER S AND THE FORT AND AY COULD'VE BEEN REALLY SCINY
Line_4609	HOW THE PANIES WERE STACKED WOULD STHEY A WOUS STACKED REALLY SLUFILY AND D WOULS STACKED REALLY NICSE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE DOES DOW MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE INSO OF AE LITTLE BIT OPPER
Line_4611	YEES
Line_4612	I CAN REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARED
Line_4613	UP CLORCK AND YEAH
Line_4614	AN EN WE ALSOW MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCEIS WAS
Line_4615	ULL I THINK SOW
Line_4616	UM THE METER STICK UCH IS STANDING UP AND ANDFL
Line_4617	MI UM AND AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S CLIPING
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE AG IS BOUNSING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS BOUNSING OFF THE WALL AND ONTO THE GROWND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKING AIR PLANS AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WEE HEAH AIKE GRASS ABOUT PANCIUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PUNGULUM HAH IS FIFTY
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LEFT SIDE UM
Line_4625	ITS AND NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT'S HOW MANY SWONGS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF SWAINS AND THE PENTO ONE AT LESE IT IS
Line_4628	WELL WE  WHAT WE DIO IT WAS JUST MAKING NTHE PLAIN THAT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	THAT WS THE ARO PLIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WERE MAKING HIN SOME BOT
Line_4630	WE HADD UM THAT
Line_4631	A LITTLE PADDL THING FOR THE WEND SING FOR THE FRUNT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN AND SWIN  THE LINE
Line_4633	IT HAS BEN TRALLIED TO PLAIN YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE  M  TRARED IT YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THING I YOU FOUR ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANY THING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I NOW I CI I CAN'T REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MINY BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS A UM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRAE WHEN YOU WARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOUR SELF UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WELL I NOW WO 'M LOOKING UP THE LINE WOULD BE UM I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	IT'S GOING YEOUH YOU HAVE
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARKED THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WERE THE PANULUM LENGTH MAYBE MARKS ON HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOK
Line_4644	UM THE NUMBERS ARE LIGH UP THERE AND UM THE NAME RAD IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PEANULLAUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THE THE BOTTOM THA OR THE HIGIEST NO
Line_4646	H MIS CALLAM THE WILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING THEARE YOU AD THINGS
Line_4648	HIS UM STRADY LEARNING OF OUT CAEFULBS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YEAT BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL ABOUT E
Line_4650	ADE IT A POPICALE STIC AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THERE
Line_4651	THEM THING YOU I SEE THE POPSICAL STICK THAT THING YOU PUT ON AS BAUM TRUMMM THE
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORC OU UAND THE ROBBERS THE RAERSTOPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM THAT WL O I DON'T THINK IT'S CONNET UT RILLY FAR
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLY ING IT GOES FLIN UP UM ILEFT CLIP STICK
Line_4655	UM MAJO STHING CAND STHE
Line_4656	E'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOTHS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FLOW AND THE'R RATHERE  UR THEY'LL UM RAH
Line_4658	SHEE FLOWED OPI WATER AND UM PEOPLE TO GET ON THEM AND SEE THE OION
Line_4659	SISERS UM WATER AND THEUM THAT'S T
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PANIES IT COULD CAM
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UM PIEOPLE
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PANS IT COULD'VE FILL INTO A CHALANDRED
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT WUIST NRANING ABATE
Line_4664	HAT S LOUT OF PANIES UM THERE'S SOME PANY CAND THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWTING ON THE WATER
Line_4665	THEYREY MANDME OF LIKE THE PANICE BEING PASSINCHERS
Line_4666	I THEY WE MAY MADE ABOUT HOW MANY PANES WE HAVE TO PUT UNTOL IT EXTHINGKTS
Line_4667	TWIT CLOWS UP IT IT SINGS FASCER BECAUSE
Line_4668	BECAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT THAND WHEN YOU THROUGH IT UM FROM HIGE
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHES UM
Line_4670	HAV CAN UM CACES TO THAT'S SMALLER AND THE UM TRIC ONES CARY MORE BECAUSE ITHE BECAUSE IT'S TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CAP CAN CARY MORE CUPCE TH AND THE SMALER ONE CAN CACE CASE THAT BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER
Line_4672	WE COULD SHOURT IN AND OUT AND THIKE COULD JME
Line_4673	THINK IT'S A BISH RY IT'S A PICH LIKE THE CAN LIKE THE CIND OF STRING YOU USE TO CATCH FISCHE
Line_4674	IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T LIKE US IN THE CHAING TO FIND IT
Line_4675	IT DIDN'T REALLY SHAKE YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON OM THE STRING YOU WOULD TA TO T SHARES AND PUT THE AIR PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ONES THEY WOULD TAKE TO PUT MAKE IT PLE
Line_4677	IT GIPS IT MORE AIR SOH YOU CAN SO YOU CAN TH CAN FLOW FASTER
Line_4678	ITHOUT THE REPELLAR WOULDN'T PLIGHT BECAUSE YU ANNEY UAN AND THEBROBER PAM WOULD HAVE NOHER TO UM TO
Line_4679	SHUREN THE COMPUTOR NICED I ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKES THE REVER BAN TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF PERPL AND SPIN T AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THEY HAVE TWO AIR PLAINS AND THEN ONE A STREING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAT AND THE OTHER ONE'S CANALLE TUN DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE THE ER ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GODN NEED TO WEIGH MORE AR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE REVER BLANT UM SWINGS LIKE TURS AROUND UM THE PERPELLAR IS GOING SO THEY CAN'T GET MORE AR
Line_4686	THEY ARE TO A BAPROMCE UMTHERCANDLE
Line_4687	MAKET THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS CON HANKING AROWND LIKE NOT THAT TIGHE
Line_4688	THIS SCRAP IS BOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOOD
Line_4690	ICE PAMPIUAL D'SWE'RE MOUNT RNEN WELL ALLAREE
Line_4691	A ABOUT SEING HOW FAR THE CLIFTER WELL THE CORCK WOULD JO
Line_4692	I SPAW LIKE A ROP ORD E
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PA
Line_4694	IT RMEAIN HATT ABOUT N HOW YOU UTHE FASTER SLOWER
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PANULUMS AND HOW THEY SQWEING IT
Line_4696	THE GRAFT IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PANSULLUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PANGULLUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ARDY SWAYING OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PRODUCTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL IN THE THER THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN T
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLAT THE FLIGHT LIN IS THAT
Line_4701	REVERBAND ID IT JUST THE PREPELLAR BARLIVE AND SPIN WHETEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRAS WITH UN EX AND WY AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PACSINGURS ON THE WY AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EXAXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PACSINGARS ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE WIY AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU ULD GATHERED IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUN'T BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WEIGH UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAISE ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSINGURS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	THEY AXIS IS OLWASE LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHEIRE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT CQUESTION
Line_4714	E'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PANGULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRAND FOTHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PANGULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TYPE THAT WE MADE AND CLASS A FOU DAYSE AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES AT ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS E SECUANT GOES AND AFTER A WILE IT STARTS TO SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPOSIT SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER R MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEIR CIND OFF LIKE CATPULBS YOU PUSCHE DOWN
Line_4724	NY THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKE YOU ABLE TO SH
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I NOW IT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	ER WHAT I THINK IS THE HIGER THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHIGHT
Line_4728	IT SEAMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIR THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE STICK IS PUTHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WAY SO THEN IT SHOUDS PRITY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPER BACE IS WHERE YOU PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK YIT PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STICKS ARE EACH CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HI IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIR OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPERBACE AND WITH SHUTING FLIPERBACERS WITH SHUTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON THE PLASSTICK ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HIG IT WENT WHITCH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS HIYE
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE CSAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BBECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING PEANGIULUMS AND TO DAY WE DOD HOW DAES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BEBECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY OULD A LOTCH LOTCH SORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING THE TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	AND STUDYING PANIULUMS
Line_4749	THEY CEEP TI'M CIND OF LIKE ON A GRAM FOTHER CLOCK THEY CEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'LD SINK THE BOT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE IT DIFFERENCE
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU TESST AN NOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TNBIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACURET AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LICFF BULBS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	OU AREDY ASCK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIME
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE THAT WAS IN HERE ON THIRSEDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TWO HARED IT MIGHT CINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SCINK ERLLIER THAN USUWAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAINS
Line_4763	THE HIRE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT
Line_4764	E HIR OR THE MORE PASSANGURS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE CRAFETD ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE WIYE LIGN WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSIANANGERS AND THE EX LIGN WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASSANGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HADD THE MORE PACONGERS IT COULD HOLD
Line_4769	EX IS THE COMPACITY OF THE BO AND THAT'S WERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THE
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENTY F IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PASSIANGUERS THAT CANT BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANYONE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	THERE IS A PANY CONNECTED TO A PENSL AND THE PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHOURTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWAING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT COAN GOO THA UM THE MORE TIMES TWO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPER CLIP THE PENY AND THE PENSAL
Line_4779	UH THE STING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THE LALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PEANIES GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE UH FASTRITLE SWING SIDEWAYSE
Line_4783	STUDYING U THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWANGIN SIDE WAYS
Line_4785	THERE IS A PANY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	UH TANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE SWONG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT OULD SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFTEY AND FIFTEEN CECUANDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	OH WEE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UM IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PANIULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID AT THE LAST STARING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	Y THINK Y CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATPULES
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPERYBASE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEING HOW FAR THE CLICK GOES AFTER YOU LANCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CWORK UH LIKE FLIE
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LANCED THE CORK
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO U LITTLE SQUAR SHAPE STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIR STICK
Line_4802	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CIG WAS WACHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN ACH THE COR
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LANCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO FARTHER
Line_4805	I NOTICE THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT FIRTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WEIGT OF THE CORCT MAKES THM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PANIEUUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PANY AND THE IT MAKES THE PANY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT'S SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S A GRAFT TO SEE HOW LONG U THE PONGULNES
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM U BIGEST TO THE LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE A ESTIMATE IS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SOBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS MEY THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINH IS GETTING UH LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH IS I THINK IF YOU PUT A NOTHER PEANY ON IT'LL STOELL B THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULD SEE YOUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DEAD UH STUFF ABOUT BOTHS AND HOW MANY PANIES THEY COULD HOLD WITH OUT CHINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE PENIESE IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UHM I DON'T FROM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UHM PANIESE ARE LIKE PASCSANGUERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MOREIT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL L IF THERE IS MORE PANY 'S ON ONE SIDE AND NN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COUL TIP OVER AND CHINK
Line_4825	SOMEONE'S DROPING MORE PEANIES IN TO THE BOTH
Line_4826	MAKE SHORE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BOT
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDZES ARE BALENCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER ANDTO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING MY A GRAS ABOUT UH BOTH
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE A BUNCH OF THINGS
Line_4831	I IT WOULD LIKE STHINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PASSEONGERS IT COALN HOLD
Line_4834	I PICK YOURED OUT THAT UM THE BIGGER THE LIFF BULBS THE MORE PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG ER WIDE THE BOT IS
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PANIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOT
Line_4837	IS THE BIGIST SOATO HOLD MORE PASSONGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STIACK UP THE PANIES IT CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PASSONGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY UH OF THE BULB WHICH IS MIL
Line_4840	UH WELL THE SHO THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GRATEST TO LEITEST OR LITEST LEST TO GOODEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE T THE NUMBER IS RISING UP
Line_4843	THE EX AXES IS THE WHENE THE CAPACITY MILLMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PACIANGURS AND THE GOING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EX AXESS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE WY AXES IS ON SO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WY AXIS SHOWS HOW MANY PASSINGURS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE Y AXIS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALLLER TENTIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PANIES
Line_4850	I NOTICE THAT THE THE NUMBER OF THE COMPACINY THE PACINGERS GOT LAUGER AS THE COPACITY GO
Line_4851	IT  THE PASSONGURS NUMBER ETHER  SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WEELL THAT SO WE COULD TEL WHITCH TO THE DIFFERENCES AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOTORS A REVER BANS AND WHY IS A DISTANCED
Line_4854	BANS THE PRITY FAR
Line_4855	WELL PASED LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WOULLD BE EASIER ATO LIST
Line_4856	WELL YOU PACE THE WY THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE AND THEN IT WILD B IT WOLLD BE LIKE DORING THERE SO  IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGED LIKE HOW MANY REIVER BANS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTR PASSONGUERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WING
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSANGERS O THE DISTANCE WILL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FHOU DAYSE AGO WE PLLUTED PAPER AR PINS
Line_4860	UM WEE MADE U HEANY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PANE
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TW MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LD CHANGED TWO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PANCILUM SWINGS BACK AND FOR
Line_4863	SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PEANY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF ITS SHORTER IT WILL PUL FA  SLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TWO MAY ARBLES THAT ONESE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CHANGED TO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE DRB A LUT OF TIME
Line_4869	THE SHOURTER IT GETS A FAT THEN MORE SWINGS IT THAT IT TAKES
Line_4870	SWAITE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SHINGS IT HAS
Line_4871	UM LETSE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORCH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT STOLKE'S THE OTHER ONES THAT THE SHORT OS THE STRAINING IS THE THE HIGAIRO THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PRODUCTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPER AND HER OF THE IPER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRITY MUCH OF WHAT WE DID  SO FON WERE GONG TO STARE UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MORO
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOINNO PUT E CORK AND THEN GIN TO LANCH AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND A SEE HOW FAR IT WILL GO
Line_4876	THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPISS THE CORCERS WEIRE MORGAN TO WLANCH AND THEN THE REVER SOPER IT HELPS  STCY UP AND
Line_4877	IT UM NOT SHURE SINCE WE HHAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE SLIPER BACE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RVER STOCK
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW MEY A MIXTURE OF THE FLIPER
Line_4880	YEAH THE WEIGHT MAY UM AFFECTS HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4881	YEAH WEILL PROPERLY TRY  AND NOT THEOS TO MORNOW
Line_4882	FOR RU WE MAKE ESTHER A DRASSFT OROR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A TURET
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER CA IT CAN IP IT BEFOR IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	IT WAS IMPORTENT TO MAXE SURE THEIRE S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WERENT DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PANEIESE
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIGHTER OR TALLER THEY 'ELL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PANIES
Line_4886	HOW M HO TALL THE BOP WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD CHINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOM IT MYGHT HAVE BABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UN LIKE ST IF
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE AND IF YOU IND JUST DROP THEM IN ANT MYHT LLINL MAKE IT TCINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THM IN THE MIDTAL THE BLBS HAVE MORE SONCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM CNEVERYWLE CINK CASSTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE U MIGHT NOT AS
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PANIES BECAUSE THEY NOT AS TALLER AND IT WILL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONE ABOUT SONK YOU TOOK ONE PANY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PANIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BOT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVER FILLW THE BOT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE ESIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORS OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY
Line_4897	ECAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T WOULN KNO IF AD  OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER IT WON'T WORK LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD AVE IF YOU ADDED TWO MANY THINGS
Line_4899	ELL IF THEY ARE WRONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU LACK  ONE ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO THINK IF YOU STUCK UM IN THE MIDDL LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT WILL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD M
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACRENT MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EACH CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG WAS STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S FILL TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S AXIDENTALLY NINE IT WILL  BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	IF WOULD SEE UM OR
Line_4905	BUT THE SMALLER ONE MAY HOLD LESS AMOUNT OR PANIES AND THEN THE MEIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MADE FOUR PAPER BS  SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WAHERS THEY CAN HOLD AND T HOW MUCH PANIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	RMS WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4908	TO HOLD PANIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UHM
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'L HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WASER AND PANIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL A BOD IS
Line_4913	U DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU CETALMIN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEAN IT WILL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL THINK BUT IF YOU PUT IN THE MIDDAL IT'LL STAY EVEN AN YOU CAN HOLD MORE TENTIESE
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDEL THINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MITTAL YOU CAN HOLD MORE PANIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER S SO RUFF THE BOT CAN TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S COM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PANYS TEN IT WILL STICY UP
Line_4917	THE THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WILN'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T NO IF YOU MADE HEM A SMALLER A BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE LESS
Line_4919	THEAT UM WE
Line_4920	ACITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER OTS AND SEE ING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PACANGERS THEY CAN HOLD WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FORDIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE CA HL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH NE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOT IS THE LESS PASSANGUERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING R IN THE MIDDAL SO IT CAN HOLP MORE BUT IF YOU PUT A AL TO THE SIDE IT WILL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PNDIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW H BIG THE BOT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4926	IT'S H CAPACITES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DIEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD HOW MUCH YOU WOOULD BE ABL TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WEE FOUND
Line_4929	THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIR SODA AS THE NUMBER OF PASSONGURS
Line_4930	THAT EIRKING THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PACSONGERS
Line_4931	HIG HER IT GETS THE MORE PACANGERS IT GETS IN MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	II SOW HURS
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DIPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PACSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW E CWHEN WE SPAT HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YO YOU L HAVE THE PROPELLAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS PRPELL AR UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODDY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STREEM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU WINED UP THE PERPELLAR
Line_4938	WELL MEAN BY PARTNER WE PUT OUR RIN AND GON WE LEARND THAT IF YOU PUT A INCLE IT
Line_4939	EFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLIY
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODDY THE PROPELLAR AND WHAT THE STRAING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOR SIX A SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE PICKAER IT OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOS AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GO SLOWER AND IT WILL GO AS FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WINES IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NON THOUT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PREASHERE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL MOR THE LESS PASSANGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER A DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSANGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WEE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT EFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF IT MADE THAT WORCSE OR MAKE IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FICKER OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WOERSER
Line_4949	ELL IF LIKE YOU TAKE OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS AND MIGHT EFECT THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICE THAT WITH ONCSE AGAIN WITH
Line_4952	M WITH MORE PASS AS YOU ADD MORE PASSANGERS THE LIN GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROBLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR AROUND THAT
Line_4954	NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE REPER BANS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIER
Line_4956	YOU CEEP ADDING ONE MORE CASSER AND AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID MY
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS UM TO CHANGE WHAT HAPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE SAW HOW FAST THEY CAN GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TOR A DISC AND THEN HELED THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESCK AND THEN JUST LIGH GO OF  IT COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRAING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TRO O YEAH AND WE TRIDED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GOW AND TRIDE HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE COULD SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THEM
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I STICKD SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPINING
Line_4968	THE FLIPSTHAT CA
Line_4969	IT SHOES HOW MANY CENTEMMETAS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMETAS
Line_4970	I SEE WHEN MY UM CLICK IT'S GOING FOU THRU
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGEELOFF THINGS RAM THE EXSPERE ON THEN IT MADDERS WHAT IT IS
Line_4972	ORMAND YEAH TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE OFF THINGS IT WILL THE IX T LIM MIGHT BE RONG AND YOU'L NOT SHOURE IF IZE RNOT
Line_4974	IT DEFECTS THE WILL DISSOLVES BECAUSE YOUYOUH
Line_4975	IT'S O AP SHOLWAY
Line_4976	IT'S CONANY BY TENT AND IT'S MOVING UP BY CEMIMETES
Line_4977	IT'S GAYING HIR AND HIR
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE PANGIYLLUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HI YOU HELD THE STRING
Line_4980	SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WEE UM MEASURED UN UM
Line_4983	ON MEASURING TOB
Line_4984	WEE CEP THE PANY ON THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE LUP THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE OTION AND THEY CARY PIEOPLE PASSONGERS AND SOME TIMES EMEARGIENTSY LUGIDG
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DROUGH A CROSS
Line_4987	WE BILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANT SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PANIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZSE
Line_4990	SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT KNUMBERS OF PAINTES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACE MAINDERS
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIZE THE PLACE MANC OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I THINK YOULD UM I DON'T KNOW VAL FARIEBLBES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS ETHER GOES DOWN UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOTHS WEARE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH OF EIGH
Line_5000	WEE DID BYE UTS DOING EVERYTHING ON EVERYPT MAKING THEIR BOTS PRITY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE RY AXIS IS THAT UM THE NUMBER OF PASSANGURS THE BOT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT FARDO CALLE LINE
Line_5005	WITCH WEARDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW VEARY YOUR BULBS CHANGED THEYELS
Line_5008	THAT IT DIPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BONT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	S THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACONERS GETS SMALLER TWOSO PRITY MUCH IS ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BY MARNEY HAVE A NIGCE STAY
Line_5011	M HI MY NAME IS CAP AND I AM NIN NS OAM WHEN YOU TOLLD ME A QUASTION
Line_5012	CROPACYEAH MEASUREMANT DECLINE AND SOMEMIT
Line_5013	ALL ABOUT HEIGHT AH I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT STHE QUIT
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A ROLEAR AND OH A METER STICK
Line_5016	HEY ARE TOBS
Line_5017	AND TALL AND AN TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WOW UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	UH I DON'T GET THE QUETON
Line_5020	UM KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I DO NOT H O ALL EN
Line_5022	THE DOORNUB ON THE PIXTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOLES THAT YOU CAN ALWASE USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SOTY
Line_5025	I SEE ONE ME TEN METER A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WITH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN RORES
Line_5028	HI DOO'T KNOB MEAN  I NO ABOUT WHAT DOWOERE
Line_5029	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A ROLER
Line_5030	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET HAS WHAT THEY CALL A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HABE
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BOLBS YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IS TEN SATAMINEARS UM IN THIS PIXTURE
Line_5034	O THOSE HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS AL AND ALL
Line_5035	THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A LOER AND NE'S W MOR MOST MORE COMAN
Line_5037	THIS BAY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYSE STARED OUT A QUARNER AND IT WILL ALWAYSE GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
Line_5039	UH WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LARNCE CENTIMETERS ANCH IS MILLIMETERS U YEARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A MTER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABBY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDOER NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THEH
Line_5043	SOM ARE THE SAME WING
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU CAL USE A ROLEAR OR YOU CAN MEUSE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK  I MEAN METER STICKS AND ROLARS
Line_5047	I DO NOT NOW
Line_5048	AND WEIGHIN THEM WITH THE CEAL
Line_5049	I DRO NOT  TO HOLB
Line_5050	WEELL THER WEIGHTS THAT OR LIKE CUMLB IT THIS TO LIGHT ST
Line_5051	IS HEAVIER THAN CHIP
Line_5052	METALWS HEAVIER THAN CASY DON'T  ANSWER
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST ATID THE MAGNET WNT THEAH THE TN WOODN'T THEN THE WOODEN BLOCK AND THEN THE JU
Line_5054	I DON' AWELL THE AMPSWER SSO'STAT A QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING BALANCED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR THE  COULD SEE THEN UH MAKE IT MEASUR O T MTALE
Line_5056	THE MDDL WASHER IS HEAVIER THA CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S A VBESTWAITE BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO D SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICXTURE SHOUD ME THAT NOT THE MIDDLE ASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MOR ACEARE MAES
Line_5061	WLM M IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT U LITTALE
Line_5062	WEL MEASUREING IT'S NOT  BUT WELL I FORGET NOT
Line_5063	WEUSED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THESE ARE PAPER QUIPS
Line_5065	WELL SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOUWOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE AND THE BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE T USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIP SMALL ONE PAPER CM T
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME SOLS BECAUSE ONE'S HEAVIEST AND ONE'S NOT HEAVI
Line_5068	THE LITTLE COB N FRONT THEY MEAN AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS FORE GRAMS ALL WHE WAIGH UNTIL THIE CINETY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	MILL CPICTURE TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THEA METAL WASHER
Line_5072	ON SAVEND SIX FIVE ARE THREE TWO ONE THEN THE LITTLE WASHER GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE BALLAM
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAM TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	MIELW GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	EAROKAY UHM WEELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH I DO NOT
Line_5078	I D THAT I DON'T ON'T KNU WAN I DI NOT R
Line_5079	I DON'T KNEE EVEN KNOW W RAVFERENCES T
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENSL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THESE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKES SEVTY GRAMS FIT THAT TO IKE TO MEASURE THATSIKE CURENT KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	UH U TH I DON'T OU DON'T KNOW
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TWO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEAD MORE GRAMS TO A TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUSE GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAV AND YOU USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE A KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WHATLL I DON'T KNOW ANT'S A SCIENCE
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASURE MAGNET MEASURE MAN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING AIS WE'VE BEEN MEASURE
Line_5092	OLLEVES A MATURE  OH W A'E MAIND MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE COURTS OF WATER MAYBIE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S A LINES AND THAT COULD PROBABLY THELW ING HOW MUCH IT COULD ROB YOU HOLBD
Line_5095	WELL VI'LE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND BY THE ONE COULD HOLD MORE LIKE TWICE A MUCH  IL TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VIL COULD POP THROUGH
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS THATWAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER 'S HOLDING A THOUSAND MIITERS OR A ONE ONLY KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UHM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH CAN
Line_5100	I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOSIS ONE A MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM  MILLILITERS  HO DON'T MUCH MA HOLDER HOW IF IT COULD BE  WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED NIITES AND THE BIG FAT TO BE ING THOUSAND ILLIMITERS
Line_5104	TIXS TEN LITTLE TWO BESE TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILLILITER
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BAE CTRICKE YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS
Line_5106	UM WELL I FORGOT
Line_5107	MILLMETER IS BIGGER AND OALETERS SMALL
Line_5108	I YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS A FU INCHES NOBLMETERS OR LIETERS
Line_5110	IT COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	IT'S A MILLYMETERS NO METERS IN THE CITH
Line_5113	WELL IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCIENCE TOOALD
Line_5114	UM WELL LE OM WE YU OULD PUT THE WATER AIND THE CERRAIN AND WHEN YOUOULD SPRING IT INTO SOMETHING TO SAYE HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS THREE CIRANCHES TO FILL
Line_5116	ELLSMACAN CAH YEAH
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS AND W FILL CUP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE OR HOW MUCH IT WILL  BUT WELL THEN SIL WE STOP FIFTEE MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES TROPERS AND HOW MANY WALLS
Line_5120	IT IS A RAGSULATED SONDER
Line_5121	THINK IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN ONLY HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER  AN OR A LIQUIDS IN IT
Line_5123	OH THERE'S MORE GRAGUWATED SILUNDER SOAD A FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND NILITERS
Line_5124	WUM I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO FIND MANE
Line_5125	WHEN YOU PRODICT YOU COULD MAKE A AN ESTIMATE AND MAKE A LIN AND SEE IF IT WOULD GO OVER UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING AS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN ASCE
Line_5127	IE COU TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWY UM WELL IT 'O WAH AND  LAND AND ONE MARE SEE
Line_5129	DON'T KNOW THE CAPACITY WE HAVENT EVEN STUDYED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHEN I 'M AERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW  CAPACITY AS HOW DOAL
Line_5132	THE CUP AND WELE HAS MORE THAN AN  OR MARIE
Line_5133	UWE HAVE AL T CPACITY SO NO'T ALL I NO
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A CWATER AND A CONTAINER AND YOU FILL IT WTH CAPACITY
Line_5135	SIS TWO HUNDRED MILLITER OF VESSAL
Line_5136	THEY COULD PROWABLY ALL WHOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIR FATT OR SCINIER AND  THEY COULD JUST DON'T HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	LIKE WELL EVERY ONE EVERY CINGAL ONE YOU PUT IN IT'S A HUNDRED AND EQUALS  TO ANDRUM ILLILITERS WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLB THE SAME MTN OF WATER
Line_5139	UM O MAROM
Line_5140	I DON'T KNOW THE CAPALCITY IS

Line_5253	U'M I  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SLCKED SPONGE OR A WIGHT SPUNGE BUT IT'S DEFFANALLY NO I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
Line_5254	NO YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM LOGICLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF WHERE THE SPUNGE IS RIGHT
Line_5255	THE DRY SPUNGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	U NOT MOCH
Line_5257	PUT DRI SPUNGEES TE GRAMS
Line_5258	IT IS IX AM

Line_5267	FR I LASS FORS THAN SAK
Line_5268	IS THEN THE S VOLID MASS AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVEITALL YOU CALN MEASURE TO THE SMALL OBJECTS WITH US
Line_5271	MEALTING IT PLYING IT BY HUNDREDS
Line_5272	SMALE THINGS
Line_5273	THE THERMOMETERS UM COUNTING BY TOWNS THIS IS CAN BY RUNS AND THIS IS COUNTING BYE HUNDREDS
Line_5274	UUH YEAH THAT'S HARTER TO EXPLAIN I SARY
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR A LIQUID
Line_5277	COOKING BAKING I BELESCED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5278	UM BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME  AH MILLIMETE LITERS ITD MILLILITERS
Line_5279	SMEALL OBJECTS WERE LIQUID OPJECTS

Line_5281	IEL A MEASURING CUP A MEADE SHURING SPON
Line_5282	A BALANCE
Line_5283	KBS COLED BUT IT'S USED FOR METACINNY AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED THE A PROCSICSE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TUSC LIKE THAT
Line_5285	THE MILDLL LITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBER STHIT THE CIRAINGCEH HOL ULLB AND THIS REARLLY FUN THO SCREEAL THUP
Line_5287	R VOISES ALOWED TO DY BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	IS A SPILL BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW WA TO THREE
Line_5289	HOSE ARE MILLYMETERS
Line_5290	WEDID SILAUNDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PER SIZE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LICQUID OR SMALL OBJECT
Line_5292	T'S A HUNDRED AN FORTY TWO MILLILMITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO BE ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINES UM
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HADD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THAN YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A SCRINCH YOU COULD BY CIRAINE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL ITD UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT HOW YOU FIT I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING STALLER BUT SCINIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT UH WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT 'LL BE FILLED TO THE GRUM
Line_5301	THEYERY ARE ITHER TALLER BUT SCINIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDEDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEN TO ZERW
Line_5304	ONE MINUT A SOLD TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN SHOTTER DM IDILS CALER
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER AND GOT TWENTY DIGREES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM TE
Line_5308	AND I JUNST STAND SOW
Line_5309	WELL SRE AM GOING TO MAKE YOUR REPIET
Line_5310	I NEED STARE BOISE FIRST SIE
Line_5311	UM  TANSTRALLY QUICLY IGIES
Line_5312	WE DROUG IT ON GRAS PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE TO UM S
Line_5314	EL AXES OR DOTS OR THINGWS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WELL YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES U UPH LAL
Line_5317	IT'S TIME HOW MUCH THE TIME IT TOOK TO CHAINGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAH AND GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICIS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WE AND THI UP
Line_5321	WET GOT IT WAS STUONED AT TWENTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUN'T HOW MA  UESS BY FIVE T
Line_5323	JUST BY COWNDING BY TENOR FIFTEY
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF IT'S WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT ITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UM NOT REALLY HO ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE AND THE UM
Line_5328	COULD BY AM REALLY SORY TO SAY THIS BIG M
Line_5329	HOLLOW MY NAME IS MAXE II LIKE TO DO MAH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH ROLARS YOU AD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	THE LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS YUSUALLY
Line_5332	E WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DUSCK AND WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT THE PERRIMETER
Line_5333	I USED A YEARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DUSCK
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS SWIFF THOSE AND I THINK THEIR STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF  IF THEY'RE IS THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'S TE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'E ALLAF THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YEOWLD STICK OR A ROLAR THEY ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVE AND NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETERS
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ENTIMETERS AND THERE ARE TEN D DECIMETERS ND A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WEE MEASURED THE COMPACAPACITY OF THE CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE COMPACITY
Line_5346	WEE USED ON THE CUMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU GET PORT UN A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRAGJETATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLLITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILL MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLLITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF IN SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FLL IT S PRMCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACCAMPACITY OF SOMETHING O  A CUP OR A WATER BODL OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	THE CUP THE CAMPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE THE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLIILITERS
Line_5354	YU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S SHORE IT'S HUL IT'S THE FOLL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSLES LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THET ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND COMPACITY
Line_5357	THE TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHOR IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE COMPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER
Line_5361	COPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOBBLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT HOW MUCH COM WHAT THE COMPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE COMPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT CANOF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF FORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENTE IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLLIUM IN THE COMPACITY THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS A DIFFERENT
Line_5367	THE COMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THE SEN A OLIUM
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE COMPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VOLIUM OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LITERS AND THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLILITERS
Line_5372	UT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADGUWATED SILNDER
Line_5373	IT'S LAYBULED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS SO YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM THEONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE TIT HELP
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINUT
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARE
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY HAVE  UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINUT
Line_5380	I WOUL DISSCRIBE IT STUP HIE AND THEN IT GOES PRITY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIER AND HIR AND HIR
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOWLY MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRASS AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5382	I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T SOLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	ARS IT WENT FROM TWENTY ALL THE WEIGHT TO FIVE IT WHENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DIGREESE AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND LAINGTH AND THEN WY WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN THOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND ANTHE OTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO WHEN THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	YOU'E TRYING TO FIGGER OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDAL AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
Line_5389	TO FIGGER OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	ELL IT SMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINEST SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINS SIDE UM SWETHS HAE LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUSS SIDE AND THE
Line_5396	UM NO H
Line_5397	THE WIRES ARE A SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU ARE DRIVING THE COLAGE SORT OF BE LIKE A HIWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK IT DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM A HIY WAIY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TOU TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM THING  JUST
Line_5400	WOLW I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRES COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NOBLE W'S JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT ARIEA WHERE THE NOASHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OFF
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHARE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	HIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB PURMS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERES STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DOES FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE U'M NOT REALLY SHUR
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BULBD ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE NE THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	THE WA AT TIMES IT'S STEEL R METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOME TIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	ON THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OUT OF THE IRON FIRE LINT STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOOULD STEEL LIKE THT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY IT WOOLD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWERE F IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND DROT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DN OWAS STICCALL TIME BUT SOME TIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UT IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT SONGS TO MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WILE BECAUSE IT CANT STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	O THAT THE NY HELP JUST INE DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	E OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COM TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOH IT THROUGH THE THIN CART BORD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS STICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FOLE THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WEE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY TO WOULN'T PICK UP ANY UDN NOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YESS WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT JUST RIGHT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COM UP WITH THE
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE EXELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A NORML PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL ST ST RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUFF POWER THAT IT WILL STURK GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE SENCEYOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAVE THEM IN THE RONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T ST WORKING
Line_5446	P THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	IN THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME AIS YOU PUT THEM IN THE RONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINES PLACE AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE ON THE PLUS PLACE SO IT WILL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYSE BECAUSE IT DIPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IN
Line_5450	TO DY I MADE POSTURS PECE POSTURS
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STEELL WITH THE PAPER IND THE MIDDAL AND THE MAGNET BILLOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRYIDED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS UN ON THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENUFF ENERGY AND THEM IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHERONE
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TODY UM WE LEARND ABOUT PIECE HOW IT'S GOND TO HAVE PIECE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WORE IS BAD TWO BUT PIECE IS REALLY GOOD SO WEE MADE PUT POSTOURS OUT FOR PESCE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS IT THEAT IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WAU THEAT ENERGY WOULDN'T GLL FU CHIEL THE LIGHT BULB  LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL THE ELECELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THEYE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE RONG WAY WHEN YOURE PUTING IT ON A BAEE THE BA WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINES
Line_5465	ELL SINCE I CLICKED ON THE BATTERY IT'S GOING TO OPOSIT WAY IF I CLICKD ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL UE I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	SEE OR AY BE OR SEE D
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BADERY WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULBCARE
Line_5469	AND AM B AND IT AFTER YOU WERE DON WITH TH WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TWO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECONLY WE'VE BEEN DOING THA ELECTRICITY AND MAGN MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR THE LAST TIME THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE BE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPIN
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HADD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAV UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BLITD UP MORE THAN THE PREVIES PICTUERE WITH ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THES D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DNIN CLAS
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAS HE PLACE TO GOW
Line_5479	THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL ALL THE BULBS E WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	IT HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULBS WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT IS GOING OUT OF ITS NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD GO AND NOP IN THE OPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE LU NO THE FLOW TO S LESST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS ESER BY DROPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPED THEM ON THE RMET CUP OR WE JUST THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A CERTAN AMOUNT WAIGHED AS THE CALS
Line_5488	MTHE WEIGHT BRAKES THE MAGNETIC WAIVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASSTIC
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WAIVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS AND BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURNTHE ELECTRO MAGNET ON NOS
Line_5492	I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINES HAS U THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTRO MAGNET THE MORE POWERFOL ELECTRO MAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT A ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	IT IT BUSED LASED AND IN THE POLARVIT S SPUN AWOUND AND CIRCALES
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSE A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARM WLIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ERIN IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON AND OFF
Line_5499	TY ENERGY WE FOUND IT E TEN MAKE THR IT MAKE THE MOTOR OR A LIGHT VBUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY ICONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TN ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES M AND THENI GOES INTO THE BULB
Line_5502	UM EONE W TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UH IT MAKES IT SO  THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	UH WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FOLWING IN IT  IN HE CIRCLE
Line_5505	WE RUBD  PAETHE CLIP ON A MAGNET AND THEN TRYIDED TO CONNECT IT TO A NOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP
Line_5507	UM IT WAS CIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN ST PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IN IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL WLIKE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH THE V MAGNET YOU CANT DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLED US BUT YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES A LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WAN'T WOR AS II I JUST DON'T THINK TO AR I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WEELL IS I TOLD YOU BEFOR THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAB S
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FASS TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINING THE THER THE OPOSIT DIRECTION THAT IT WAS ONE THE BATTERY WAS THE OPOSIT WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	BECAUSE IT'S IL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM  WHAT DO EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAD IT JUST SWITCH EIS THE WEIGH THE THE MOTOR FLAP RUNS
Line_5522	INSTAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT WILL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WEAGH THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCH BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEIGHT TO LIFT THE MAGNETS APPART
Line_5525	WH DO YOU WANNA DO IT LIKE O
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS  WHAT HEY CALLED IT
Line_5529	WEY WHAT TO COP ARE PARAL
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	UM DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS  PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLES TILL CEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT SAYS U NABLE HARD WIRE ESELARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICE THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRA
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERIES THEY YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMER BE FOR BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY  IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOOLD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS THAT WHEN ONE BUNS UP THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARAT AND ONE HA I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD URN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE UM ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WERE TO STOP THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
Line_5548	I THINK ITLD SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNETS
Line_5550	WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOCXS AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS COPPER
Line_5552	AND UM SUM I FORG
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM ECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT UM SOMEWARE IN THE CAR BOCKS AND WE TRYD TO FIND IT
Line_5554	ELL WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPESS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOCXS AND THEN WE CIRTCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	THE POINTING CELLS WHEARE THE METAL AIS SAND LIGHT YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPESS SO THEN IF THERE IS MA METAL OR LIKE AS ROCK SOMEWARE IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER A MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TENETALLY FINDES UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIN METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WITH MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUB
Line_5561	BY USING LIKE A NEAIL OR A NOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOCKXS AND FIND IT TOL ITS FEELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT CINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY STICK TO CERTAIN CINDES
Line_5563	IT KIND OF L LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWD THE MAGNET WHER EVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NOW IT DID NOT IT JUST UM KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNER THE PLAIGHT
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SHR
Line_5566	THE  THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LEVER SIDE THE PENSAL
Line_5567	YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEYIR DNOT IS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT A STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BEECAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUIGHT SEARE
Line_5571	I THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SHURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MAT A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE  ROCK I THINK AND THE
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON INT TOWARDS OFF
Line_5575	IT'S IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FARST THING BUT WE HAVE TO UM PLA AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UM WHAT
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUIGHT SHURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	THE ENERGY UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	U CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	LL WE PUT IT ON DINER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY APINAN I WOOD I I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE FIG ICH SIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THESE LITTLE SANDBLES AND WE SAW UM AND  TE AND JUST SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH WITH THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB AND ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE THE LIGHT BUB THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM IM NOT EXACTLY QUIGHT SHURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	UM THE DRUMS RELAGHT BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WHET STARTD BUT IT GOES TO WAIGTHT FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	U IT ALWAISE CUPS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERYANDTS SLAW AND THEN PUT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN PUT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE WLIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE NE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAISE COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST PUED UP TO THE LITTLE PLAIGHT
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HUCKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN GET TO TE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLB THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL TO THE PLAIGHT
Line_5602	UM WELL AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NIGHT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICE THEY' ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT AT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO IS THE T ONE IT COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS THE ET THEIR WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTON LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS AUM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS TO BE SIMBLES AND IT THEY'RE ON DISC
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUASTHERD BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM I NOTQUIGHT
Line_5616	WE NEADE A MAGNET THAT CAN  TURN OFF AND UM
Line_5617	UH WEIGH RH
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAPES THE UM UM LT THE POWER CO TO THE THE RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	HOTHINGS HAPPANING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MA THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET CIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I NOT YEAT QUIGHT SHURE BAT I THINK IT'S A SPESAL METAL BUT I'M NOT QUIGHT SHURE
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIDED THAT AN NOFTHING WOULD HAPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE USED JUST NORMALE MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT  ULD NOT SHURE IF I'M CORRECT IT'S JUST IN MY OPPIANMAN
Line_5629	WELL IF U THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WEE UH SO JUST WAI I FORGET
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIDED UM THE WIRES TOUCHING INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOFTHING HAPPAND
Line_5632	THERE IS NOT ENUFH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WEE AFTER HELP FROM MIML  A TOLL JUST TBY RAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM ON ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE MAKE THE LIGHTS TURN ON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FOMELECOF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGHT MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	IT MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOH WILL NEAD MORE YOUR
Line_5641	NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	E YOU CAN STILL MAKE UM A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN PRIDER THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERRY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE RONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE AN
Line_5648	IN THE RONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE N
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SOULD PROBABLY  BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I I YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WOULD WALK TO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BOTH UM THEE
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRES SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNETAND THAT'S WHAT T'S HAPINING
Line_5657	IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THER
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE THE SPUNGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	SOW THE SOTY MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPNING
Line_5662	UM YES IT IS BECAIS I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROGJECTS SIMORE TO THIS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISOM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU RAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAIN
Line_5670	YES WITH OUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORKETD WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YE SIENCE IS VERY QUIL
Line_5674	UM WE'VE SEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	IPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THEY HAVE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHES GOING INTO A CUP SIF IT UNHED THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEN HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UN HOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	UT IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY H IN THE CUP TO UN HOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING D TACHED FROM EACH OTHER F BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY ARE BEING D TRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT IS HAPINING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PRASS THE ONWASHE THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATE THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GRAS WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YEES IT DAUS TELL US
Line_5686	ASHERS IT TAKES TO MAKE THE FOURCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHEES IT TAKES TO BRAKE THE FORCE
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHES THE MORE LIKE LY IT TAKES TO BICK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_5689	I THAUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HUDD THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAS A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND M WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT ITS SPONGE
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BATCHERY A BATTERY CARIES ELECTRICITY AND H WELL WHATO YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE CECANT THING WE DID IN SCIENCE WHERE WE USED UM THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LEFF CORNER AND THEN YOU OULD HAVE
Line_5697	I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT WHATEVER IS IND HEARE IS A SOLIGHT BULB UP
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S  IT L IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS CINDOF LIKE A SCREEN RIGHT KNOW
Line_5700	LECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN OM THE BATTERI'S WOULD CIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERIY THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPNNING
Line_5704	NOW IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND THE PLASTIC THIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	NAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	HAT THE MAGNET CAN GO THREE THINGS THAT I NEVER NOW IT CAIT GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE INJOIDE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_5709	UM WE BILT A BOCXE AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEERE WHEYRY DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND T
Line_5710	WHEN THE METTALE SHAVINGS FOUND THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE MAGNETS ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF UH THEND MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VEARY THIN CARD BORD
Line_5713	UM PROBLY MAY BE ABOUT SIX OR SEVAN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	BCAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HERE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNET IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFEUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT'S STAD TO THAT CERTAN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'LD NOW WHERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO TH PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FIELL THE FORCE WHEN YOU HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNET IS THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE ONMINOFF SWITCHH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ONRIN OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE IRINUFF SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THERONG PLACE THE MOTOR IT'S NOT GOING TO RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR RAIL RUN
Line_5721	OTOR IF THE MOTOR SORE RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE SO WE HAVE TAKAN A UM OH WHAT DF I D I FORGIT
Line_5723	IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	U PUT BULE WIRES AT THE BULB OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SINCE IT'S NOT EXACTALLY TOUCHING TOUCH E UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM  YEAH F CAUSE WE TRIDE AT A CUPLVE TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE IT ELECTR A MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEY'E CALLED
Line_5731	UND NO ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	ELL THE MAYWE DID IT IS OUR SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECT UM CONNECTED SO THE ELECTRO MAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRICIY
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTRO MAGNET UM IT WIL COM THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	THE ELECTRICITYS FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	POWER IS GETTING TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	UM THE REASON IT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT STAR TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH  MA  THE ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MINING IN SIENCSE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASELY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROW MAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWWES THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT TO MIX THE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5748	INSULATION MEANS LIKE THE COPER WIRE IS AND SIDE OF THE GREEN CODA
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN ON THE SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS TITS STAYS BMAGNETICK
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF ANDYES BUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME THE CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND YOU THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB IS N'T WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I OBSERVED WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN SIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CAN NOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NOH WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNIN ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISOM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT ON THE CIN SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LETS GO APARD
Line_5760	WHEN MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WLL UM THAT IT WILL COLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN THEM
Line_5762	ROCK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL ON THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM H IS ALUNIMINIUM ALUNIMIUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPELING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING A PART THEYW'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNET S ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APPART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	ISEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET TESTHE MAGNET TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THEN NINTEEN WASHERS BROK THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TWO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEYO PROPERLY SEPARATED QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACES AND BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FOURCE FORN THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE PALLED THEM SELES BECAUSE OF THE SPACES TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU GET A HIR NUMER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS AND YOU GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WELL REPEL THEM SELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
Line_5776	YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND DOWN YOU SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION SAND BE CREATIVE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY

Line_4	CAN YOU SAY THAT IT C
Line_5	I SEE WATER LIVE TREES THE SCIYE CLOUDS HOUSES AND A MOUNTAIN
Line_6	ERTH
Line_7	THE LIFE AND ALL THINGS LIKE TREES AND PLANTS AND CROAL AND FISH AND HOU EVEN HUMAN
Line_8	LIFE
Line_9	I SEE A DESERT I SE WELL A FORIST I SEEN
Line_10	THE LIGHT BLUE REPRESENTS THE WET LANDS THE YELLOW REPRESENTS THE DESERTS THE PURPLE WEPBIRS AND LIKE THE FREEZING PLACES AND THE DARK GREEN REPRESENTS THE FORISTS
Line_11	WELL LET WET LANDS HAVE FROGS AND PLANS AND FISH DESERTS HAVE LIKE SPANS AND SNAKES AND THE FORISTS HAVE LIKE BEARS AND LOSE AND TRES
Line_12	IT SHOWES ME LIKE A FOX A BUNNY A HUMAN A BIRD UM LIKE BUG A FLOWER LIKE MUD AND GRASS OR LIKE I THINK THAT'S LIKE A MOUN
Line_13	A FOOD WE
Line_14	IT IS WHAT ANIMALS E AND WHAT ANIMALS COULD GET EATEN BY LIKE AN ANIMAL'S FOOD AN ANIMAL'S PREDR LIKE LIKE SO IT SAY A BUNNY RABET IS LIKE FOOD FOR A SNAKE A HOCK AND LIKE A LIKE MUSHROOM IS A YEAH THERE'S MUSHROOMS AND THE LISERD THERE IS LIKE BACTERIA GRASS BACTERIAS FOOD FOR THE GRASS
Line_15	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_16	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER SOME FUNGY IS A DECOMPOSER AND GRASS IS A PRODUCER
Line_17	BIE
Line_18	HOW ARE YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WOULD LIKE THE PLANT PLANS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MUNKIY AND THE HALK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ARE CO THE THATERIA AND FUNGI IS AR LIKE THE CONTHE D COMPOSERS
Line_20	PRODUCE MY OWN BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS VETAL IT MAY SINK ME IF I WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY HOLE ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FUEL
Line_21	I WELL IRON LIKE HAVE MY OWN THROUGH AND LIKE FROM AN ANIMAL LIKE LIKE YOU SHALL LET SAY IF I WERE WELL SOMETHING LIKE A HAR I WOULD EAT THROUGH LIKE GLASS SOMETHING LIVING AND LIKE ONEOF MY PREDTORS WOULD BE LIKE A HOCK
Line_22	A D COMPOSER D CANON LIKE D COMPOSERS THERE WON'T FLUE LIKE UP LIKE UM BROUGHT IN FRUEE OR AND PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_23	D COMPOSING ROUGHT IN FUOD AND THE FLUOD THAT THEY D COMPOSED GAVE THEM ENERGY
Line_24	SOME WILL SOME STUFF E LIKE MAYBE ANE IN BACK TERIA
Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PICTURES OF A D COME OF DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT BULB LIKE DOGERDEMORNS KIND OF LIKE ON THE TOP THE FRONT IN
Line_27	OR ON THE VORE I THINK HE IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANT LIKE A YOU SAY LIKE BERRIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A ONDEVOR EAT ALL WELL SO IF UM IS THE PREFICT OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO ONVORS ARE ANIMALS THAT EATS ALL THINGS LIKE MEATS FRUITS AND VECHTABLES
Line_29	A KIND OF OR
Line_30	IN MOST S JJEALU
Line_31	THAT HELPS THEM WITH THEIR FROUT AND THAT IS PART OF AN EAGLE S
Line_32	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_33	HOW ARE YOU
Line_34	HOW A'S THE EST IT'S BELOW WIND UH WELL IT'S LIKE MAKING A BAD THITHER ANOTHER AT BECAUSE THE ANIMAL CRACKER IT STEN'T GO LIKE A UP
Line_35	IT MOST RUBBING THINGS IT DOES SHOULD JUST LIKE IT I FEEL ONE BECAUSE I COLD LIKE IT'S GATHER ABOUT S RU
Line_36	THE FACT THAT THAT IS LIKE MAYBE LIKE BEES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE MATERIAL IS SO LIKE BUT THAT'S LIKE MATERIAL FOR THEM
Line_37	THE CIRCLE ONE AT EITHER HILL IS FLY A ONE RIGHT IN IN A DARK BO WE CHIPPED OUR BRAINS TOO DAY AND THAT MARRY IT LOOKS LIKE AD HARACKARY THAT'S SO ONE BUT THE FIRST THEM THAT LOUD TO THEM DOWN IN THE LA
Line_38	MATROMADGAR
Line_39	SOME WISE
Line_40	L ACOLUE NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS THIS ONE THING IT HELPS THEN MAKE IT WATER IT DON'T
Line_41	BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS LIVING THING AND IT NEEDS WATER YOU THING YOU CAN JUST EGNORE JUST TAP IT AND THEN THE BULB
Line_42	YES BECAUSE IT IS A BERGAR UM THE THING TO BE COMPOSERS WHICH THEY NEED THIS KATTY DID NOT D COME IT BUT THEY MEAD TO LIKE BERGLARS
Line_43	THAT PLANTS THE LIVING I
Line_44	WHAT
Line_45	NO
Line_46	NOE BECAUSE PLANTS USE FIRTALIZER BUT THEY DON'T HALF TO USE IT
Line_47	YOUSE
Line_48	IT MEEDS WIND IT MEAEDS SOIAL IT MEEEDS UN AND IT MEEENS THOSE IMPORTANT STUFF
Line_49	BY NEAT CARBONDYOGSIDE IN OCIGIN AND WIDE S BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT HELPS THE SERVIVE AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE LIKE RUN
Line_50	THEY ARE LEAVING US
Line_51	WIND IT DOESN'T GET WATER AND A WIND NO ON OR CARPOSIDE ALL THAT'S ONLY JUST WHAT IT'S LIKE WHAT IT ES WATER WIND
Line_52	IT IS ALSO DYING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE LAST ONE BUT IT IS NOT GETTING ANY WATER AND THEN LIKE IT ALL SO SO IT NEEDS THAT MATERIAL AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY WATER IT'S THE ARGON WILL LIVE LIKE I PROCEED IT'S LIGHT
Line_53	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_54	YES
Line_55	HI
Line_56	TWOLAR OUT ONES
Line_57	IT'S THEM
Line_58	THESE ARE INDVIDZIAL THWARDS ALL AND THEY MIGHT BELIVING ALESEOULAVOU
Line_59	BECAUSE WE HA DON'T BECAUSE A ABOUT A WORE ONE THING AT THE
Line_60	REABEANKE
Line_61	FLESH
Line_62	ONES ARE JUST LIKE HUMAN ANIMALS OR JUST LIKE TWO MEN LIKE HUMANS ARE TWO AND THEY'RE ALLY THEY ALL MADE OUT OF SKIN CELLS BLOOD SELLS PAR LS
Line_63	THEIR BLOOD SEALS
Line_64	I SEE MAYBE PLANT WELL ELSE C A LEAF WELL THIS IS A PIXTURE OF LEAF OF LEAF S
Line_65	THE LEAF HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOOKING SELLS AND THE HUMAN HAS TO JUST LIKE THREE OR FOR ON ONE BUT THE HUMAN ALSO HAS MELTABLES THAT'S LOOKS IN DIFFERENT S
Line_66	THEY NEED WINGS THEY NEED A BODY AR HEAD AND DEN TELLS YOU KNOW LIKE
Line_67	MY BOWES ARE LIVING
Line_68	WE DON'T
Line_69	RIDING DOWN
Line_70	IT'S A STUFF THAT PRODUCTS THE ST SO IT'S LIKE OF THE AC THE UM AND THAT IT AND IT BURNS DOWN TO SLOWED
Line_71	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_72	A WELL WE WERE ARE RING ABOUT LIKE VS AND THE LIVING CITIZINO LIKE THE VANS MIX ZIDELAM AND FLOWEM
Line_73	A LEAF
Line_74	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE SHOES THEY LIKE DIFFERENT WHERE AS IT GOES THE LEAVES A DIFFERENT SHAPE LIKE I REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WAS PARALLEL
Line_75	THERE THERE IS THREE TI REALIZE MEMBER TWO OF THEM I DON'T WANT OF THEM WAS A PARALLEL UNNOW THERE SPOALLMAPE
Line_76	DWELL THESE HAVE VAINS MIGHT THAT TRAVEL LIKE THE SAP OR SOME THAT EVERY THIS IS LIKE THE SAME THING HAS RAINS THAT ROLL IN A TWO PANTS
Line_77	ABOUT AMBLES AND HOW TRACT AND MOST OF THIS IS SE AND HAVING GET NOTICED
Line_78	STRI SEE LIKE CUPS M SHAPE KIND OF AND AN I SEE LIKE CANALREFRES AND STRIPES
Line_79	THE SMELL
Line_80	IT USES ITS WEPED FEET TO UM LIKE PUSH WATER THAT MAKES IT SWINM AND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES HELP BASICALLY CHOMP THE MEAT AND BRAKE IT DOWN INTO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOPLE GUESS LIKE SO IT'S BASICALLY SHOWING IT UNDER LIKE THE ANOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU NO
Line_83	THEUN
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS TENDS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP WAT NE TONS OF LITTLE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE HUGE SISTOM
Line_85	THE CAR COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF AWAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO OUR SCIENCE PLAY OR SCIENCE SCIENCE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S A MOTOR AND LIKE WEALS AND STUFF AND US OF STUFF THAT MAKES IT A BIG STICITIUM
Line_86	THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE OUST THEN THAT JUST SLIPS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT DON'T NEED IN THE CAR AND THE WEAELES AND THE WEALS ARE WHAT MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_87	IT'S HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SISTOMS LIKE YOUR MUSSLES AND YOUR HEART ON YOUR LUNGS AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_88	IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BE W WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW LIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE WE WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HERT IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS US MAKE TURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STUMMIC
Line_89	THE ERTH IS A SISTOM BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SPEERS LIKE AHIDROFC SPEER THE JEO SPEER AND THE BIO SPEER AND THE HIDRAC AND THE ATMOUSFEER BUT THE SO THOSE LITTLL SUBE SISTOMS THEY MAKE UP ONE BIG SISTOM CALLED ERTH
Line_90	YEES I DO THINK IT'S A SYSTOM BECAUSE THERE IS THE HIDROSFEER AND THE JGEO SFEERR AND THE ATMOSFEER AND THE BIO SFEER AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG SISTOM
Line_91	OK THE BIO SFEER IS THE LIFE AND TH AND LIKE THE TREES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND THE HIDRO SFEER IS THE WATER AND WE AND THE BIOSFEER NEEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND THE ATMUSFEER IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKI SO AND THEN THE JEO SFEER IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEED THE JEO S THAT THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE JEO SFEER SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE BIROSSFEER NEEDS THE HIDRO SFEER WE AND THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE ATMUSFEER BECAUSE WE NEEDS SOME OF THE AIR THAT'S UP THERE AND THE HIDRAGOM POUCTWHATEVER THE STUFF BREETH AND WE NEED THE HIDRO SFEER BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD BE PUT OF THE BIO SPEER AND THE TRES THAT'S ALSO BE SPEER AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE JEOSFEER I CAN SEE THE SKY WHICH IS THE HITS NO HIGH ATMOSFEER AND THEN THE WATER R UM ON THE BOTTOM IT THE HIDRO SEER
Line_93	THE ERTH
Line_94	THERE ARE OR SISTUMS THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIDRO SPEER AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECOND ONES THE JEO SFEER AND THAT'S THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BO SPEER AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE IN TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOSFEERE I KNOW THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOS FER WHICH IS LIKE THE SKY
Line_95	I SEE A LOT OF LIKE UM BIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES AND THAT ONE SPOT LIKE ANIMALS OR TREES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITH OUT THE WET LANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER AND WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STOF THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WETLANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HAPPE TAP SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAR TO THE ANIMALS
Line_97	THERE IS LIKE FORIST AND STUFF WHICH AIRS USUALLY LIVE THERE S LIKE TENDRS WHICH IS LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACES WOULD PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HIDRESFER WASN'T HERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE HIDRESFEER WE WOULD NEED UM THE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS S SNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE IS LIKE M ANIMAL AND I THINK T'S A FOOD WEB BECAUSE THE THERE IS THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND THE T THE GRASS EATS AND THEN THERE IS LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOODWEB
Line_99	FOULBLAINS A FOUND WA
Line_100	WHAT EATS W AND WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATS W AND WHAT DOESN'T EAT ANY THING AND IT JUST GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THE LIKE IT THE ARROWS MEAN WHAT EATS THAT ONE THING SO SORT IT JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DO IT LIKE IT SHOWES ME LIKE IF I HAVE LIKE A TESTER OR SOMETHING AND IT SAID WHAT DOES THE BUNNY EAT I COULD LOOK AT OF FOOD WHEREVER AND IT SHOWS THAT BUNNIES EATS SCRASS SO IT SHOWS A IT SHOWS YOU WHAT IT EATS W AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE FUNG IS STUFF IN THE MOLES AND GRASS AND PIN COINS AND STUFF
Line_103	M HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGUS M FUNGS FUNGUS GETS EATEN BY PIN CONES AND PINS GET PINE CONES GET EATEN BY THE BARK BEETLES AND THE BARK BUNDLES GET EN BY THE BY BY THE SALIMANDOR AND THEN THE SALIMETORS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RAP AND THE SAND THE RAPIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RAT ALSO GETS EATEN BY E HOT RED TAIL HOCKS AND THEAND SPERROWS ARE EATEN BY TAIL HOCKS SO IT'S SPASICALLY JUST THE BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS Y AND WHAT DOES IT W AND ALL SORTS OF ER CLOSE SINGERS
Line_104	UN
Line_105	I'VE BEEN STUDIING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO IN THE DARK OR IN THE LIGHT
Line_106	UM THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING CAUSE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE CERTAIN LIVE WORK SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS AND SYSTMS THAT'S SINCE SINCE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AN HEN THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAT AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR EAST IS STORM SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOOD IT WILL IT'LL BRETH AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IT WILL PROVE UP
Line_107	M THE EST E HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND THE EST ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO AND IT'S DORMENT SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SCREESE SOME WELL PUT AT THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN THE EAST WILL WAKE UP AND IT'LL STORT BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL POOF
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BREATHING BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE DO IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BRETH AND WHEN THEY BRETH WHERE EVER THEY ARE IF IT'S IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BAGGLE POOF UP SO IT LS SHOW THAT THEY'RE BREETHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND IF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS ITS FOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO A BUBBLE UP ANEALMOST SO MAY SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT JUST A WAY THAT WE WOULD MAYBE WE COULD WELL SINCE IT'S A LIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS E
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YELLOW AND SOON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN SO IT WILL H SO IT'LL DIVE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN SHINS ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE THEN SOMEONE'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THE THEN THE WATER AND THE SUN AND GIVES IT IT'S FOOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLYL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER HELP AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THE UH MAKES IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS THEIR FOOD
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN THE PLANT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NEW TRANS FROM THE SOIL AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THES ERTH THE SUN GOES ON TO THE LEAF AND IT WILL OBSORBD THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE UM SHOOGAR AND THAT'S FOOD
Line_115	UM I THINK THE PLANT UM MEANS THAT I DON'T WELL YOU I THINK THAT PLANT NEEDS THE AIR BECAUSE WELL I SIMPLY KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND UM I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BREETH AIR O AND THE PLANTS UM THE PLAN UM THE PLANTS AN BRETHS OR SOMETHING BREETHS THE CARBONDIOCXIDE A IN THAT WE BREATHE OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BRETHE THE EAR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BRETH THE CARBONDIOCSIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND THEPLANTS NEED THE SUNS TO SERVIVE BECAUSE WITH OUT THE SUN MIGHT THEY WON'T BE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THEM LOOK GREEN AND THEAND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS LIKE THEIR FOOD
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBLOM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLAN PLANTS NEEDS SUN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN THEY CAN PRODUCE SHUGER AND IF THEY CAN PRODUCE SHIGER WHICH IS THEIR FOOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBERGER AND A HAMBERGER IS SOME THING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEED BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND THEY DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	UM IF WE DON'T FEED IT FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLUM BY UM IF IT WASN'T UM MAKING ITS OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLUM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED FIRTALISER BECAUSE FIRTALIZER IT'S LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN AND WITHOUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NEW TRANS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEED A FRALISER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND THE I THINK PLANTS ARE GOIN NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE USUALLY HAS A BACK YARD AND IF IT HAS A BACK YARD THAT MEANS THAT'S PROPARBLY DIRT AND THAT'S SOMEWHERE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE STOOD
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE TH IF IT RAINES THAT GIVES THEM WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THAT WHEN IT'S SUNY THE IT GIVES THEM THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THEY'LL GET THE WATER AND THE PLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUNNY THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUN IT'S THE SUN GIVING OF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANTS GETTING FROM THE COVERDZIOCIDE AND AND NEW TRANS FROM THE DIRT AND ITS RUTS AND IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREETH
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DRENK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES IT IT GIVES IT ITS FOOD BECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH FOTO CYMTHACIS AND THE THE CARBDYOCIDE IT IT US THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BRETHS AND IT BRINGS OUT AND IT BREETHS OUT OCIGIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE BRETHE SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED IT BECOME DIOCID CARBON DYOCCIDE AND WHEN WE SPEAK WE LET SOME OTHER CARBON DOCCIDE OUT AND THEN THEY'LL PRODUCE OCIGIEN FOR US
Line_130	THEY OBSORBED THE SUM AND THEY NEED THEIR CARBONARY OCCIDES SO THAT THEY CAN BREETH AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SHGER AND THAT SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY RED OUT THE OCIGON AND THAT'S THE STUFF WET BRETH
Line_131	YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT ER IN THEY MAKE THAT IN SOME FOOD AND THEN THEY BREATH A CORD ACID AND THEN THE WATERS STRIPS THE WATER THROUGH THEM
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS AND PRODUCE SHOGER BECAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT'S THE SHOGER SO IT'S DIVING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN MAKE ITS FOOD AND IF IT CAN'T MAKE ITS FOOD THEN IT CAN'T REALLY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TO ANYTHING TO CAN EAT IT'LL DIVE
Line_134	NOT AN SIGN
Line_135	UM IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIND OR AIR AND WITHOUT THE WIND ER AIR IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH IT'S JUST GOING TO DIVE
Line_136	IT CAN'T BREATH SO IT DIVES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVELE UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITHOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WE NEED WATER AND F WATER FED AND AND OCIGON TO TO SERVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIVE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OCIGEN AND THE WATER IT NEEDS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND IT CAN BREETH SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	THE LESS THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THROUGH THE THINGS IT NEEDED SO THAT SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY THEY COULDN'T REALLY PRODUCE THEIR FOOD OR DRINK OR BREATH THE OCIGIEN THAT THEY NEED BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATH THE OCIGEN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GO BE HELPTHIER THAN THOSE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT STARTS OUT AS WHAT IT EATS IT'S OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER ET MAKES ITS ON FOOD THAT AND IF IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOD
Line_142	LIAKE MAPLE TREES MAP BELIEAVE MAP BELEVES AND THEN THERE IS LIKE PARALLEL LEAVES AND THAT'S DISC LIKE THE VAINS AND THEN THERE IS THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WERE THERE IS ONE MAIN VAN IN VAINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THE MORE VAINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN DATE ONE VAN COMING OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONES VAN ARE PARALLEL M THE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GOES STRAIGHT THE ONE THERE IS ONE VAIN THAT GOES STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS AND THEN ONE HAS THERE IS MORE THAN LIKE ONE VAIN VAIN BECAUSE THEN THE IS MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE VMAIN VAIN AND THEN ONE VAIN COMING OUT OF IT BUT THAN THAT AT L DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE'S JUST UM HAS A TU OF JUST TU OF THE VAIGNS GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER TWO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE MORE COMING OUT OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE ONE WHERE IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANY MORE EXCEPT FOR THAT
Line_145	ON ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PARALLEL IS PARALLEL UM AND THEN OTHER TWO AR AND THEY J THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE PARALLEL BUT UM THEN IT THERE IS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN IN ONE AND THEN A FEW OTHER VAINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VAIN BUT THEN NOTHING COMING OUT OF THE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE WITH A UM WITH THE MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS MORE VAINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	UM THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS PENNATE UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FETHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THINGS COMING AND VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN THING BUT THAT NO VAINS COMING OUT OF THOSE ONES THAT ARN'T THE MAIN THING AND THEN PALMAT IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A TUN OF VAINS ALL OVER SO THERE IS AND THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAIN SO THAT MEANS THERE'S EXTRA VAINS AND THEN PARALLEL IS JUST A TURN OF PARALLEL UM VAINS
Line_147	THIS IS THETHIS IS THE NESS IS THE PANT AND IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN MORE VRAINS COMING OUTOF THAT ONE MAIN VEIN
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TIPES LEAVES UM PRODUCES MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SHOOGER AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS ORAND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_149	TO CARRY SHOOGER TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARRIES IT TO THE ROUTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROUTS CAN SEND IT UP IN MORE VAINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE BEAT ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TIPES OF VAINS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SHOOGEAR TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE BAINS IN THE LEAVES M HOW ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKES THE SHOGER FROM THE FOTO CYMTHECIS AND ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT PIECE OF THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOOD AND THEN SO THAT IT CAN FEED ITSELF ON EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT TIPS OF VAINS AND ONE IS CALLED THE POLUM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SHOOGER TO THE PLANTS AND THETHE OTHER ONE IS THE SILUM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT B THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STAY IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP INTO THE REST OF THE PLANTS UM THROUGH ONE VAN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ZILUM AND THEN ALL THE NEW TRENTS AND SAP MAY BE AND SHOOGER IS GOING THROUGH THE THE FOLUM UM TO THE RUTS
Line_154	UM IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES IN EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLOOD WOOD IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THAT PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF AND EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT BEAN I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE Z IT PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT'S JUST LETS THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT WAIST B BECAUSE IN THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED INTO THE BAG BECAUSE THE PLANT S UM THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T RE CIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANT IT JUST EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S WATER ON THAT
Line_158	BIEME
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALSO KIND HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SYISTOMS AND H WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SCUNK IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND I TURNALS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND SO E
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COLORS AND SHAPES AND THEPROBABLY DIFFERENT SISTOMS ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A WARNING NOT TO EAT ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IS PROPERLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO I THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS IT'S WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL UM TURTALS THEY LIKE TO THEY UM THEY'RE UP ON LAMS SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTALS CAN AND THEY KIND OF CAMIFLAS AMIFLAS SOMETIMES BUT UM YOU CAN SEE TURTAL LIKE TURTALWELL TURTALS THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTALS WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND SO SO THEY CAN SEE EACH OTHER UM AND THEN THE FISH ARE REALLY BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEAN DON'T EAT ME TO CREDITORS IN THE OTION OR THEY JUST WANT TO FIND MEAT AND THEN SCUNKS THEY HAVE WHIGHT THEIR WHIGHT AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLY TO SHOW HAY DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR I'LL EVE STICK EVERYWHERE SO
Line_165	YES I DO
Line_166	UM PEOPLE THE ANIMALS DON'T WANT TO EAT THE SCUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED SO THAT HELPS THE SCUNK STAY ALIVE
Line_167	OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHELL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP CREDITERS FROM GETTING INTO IT SO IT CAN HIDE IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDITERS CAN'T EAT IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO I SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUE FETHERS IF I SAW BLUE FETHERS THAT BE AT ATTRACTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ALL SO ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HA I'M POISONOUS OR HAH A MILE IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GOING TO SPRAY YOU OR YOU DON'T WANT EAT ME I DON'T TASTE GOOD SOME LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DOCK DIDN'T HAVE FEET WEBBED FEET IT COULDN'T PADDTL THROUGH THE WATER AND IF IT COULDN'T PADDL THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO THAT THE FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTAN'T PART
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIONS DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BE GUM AND WITHOUT IF AND WITHOUT THE TEETH IT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY LIKE GRAVEL AND ANTALOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD JUST KIND TO SMOCE IT A LITTLE BIT
Line_171	BECAUSE WITH OUT THE TEETH IT'S JUST UM AND AND IT IN A LINE CAN'T BEIGHT THINGS TO KILL IT SO THAT YOU CAN EAT IT IT WITH JUST UM BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY SMASH THE SEEM A LITTLE BIT I'D BE LIKE YOU COVERING YOUR TEETH WITH THE YOUR LIPS ALMOST M THEN BIGHTING YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH AS IF YOU JUST BIT IT
Line_172	THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HAD ITS A SPECIAL DESINE THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT MIGHT EVEN LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN YE BUT THE BRIGHT COLORS MEAN HA YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I'M POISONESS EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE POSES
Line_173	RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE THEIR TAIL WHEN SOME OR SOMETHING GETS CLOSED BECAUSE THEN AND THEN THAT TELLS THEM HAY I'M HERE A DON'T STEP ON ME OR I MIGHT BIGHT YOU
Line_174	WELL A PERSON WALKED UP AND THEN RAP THE RATTLE SNICKSR SHAKING ITS TAIL AND BY SHAKING THE TAIL ITS TAIL THAT WARNED THE PERSON NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER BECAUSE THE SSNAK MIGHT STRIKE
Line_175	THE HUMAN KNOWS THAT IF IT GETS ANY CLOSER THE RATTLE SNAKE WILL STRIKE AND BIGHT YOU AND IF IT BIGHTS YOU IT PUTS POISON IN YOU SO THAT COULD KILL YOU ALLMOST SO IF YOU HEAR THE SNAKES RATTLE TAIL IT MEANS DON'T COME ANY CLOSER BY YOU

Line_2	THE WHEELS CAN MOVE
Line_3	THERE IS LIKE THE DIGEST SYSTEM THE IS LIKE THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE HEART AND THERE IS LIKE THE BRAIN
Line_4	CAN YOU SAY THAT IN C
Line_5	I SEE WATER LIVE TREES THE SITE CLOUDS HOUSES AND A MOUNTAIN
Line_6	ER
Line_7	THE LIFE AND ALL THINGS LIKE TREES AND PLANTS AND CROAL AND FISH AND U EVEN HUMAN
Line_8	LIFLE
Line_9	I SEE A DESERT I SEE WELL A FORISTT I SEEN
Line_10	THE LIGHT BLUE REPRESENTS THE WET LANDS THE YELLOW REPRESENTS THE DESERTS THE PURPLE BIRDS AND LIKE THE FREEZING PLACES AND THE DARK GREEN REPRESENTS THE FORISTS
Line_11	WELL LET WET LANDS HAVE FROGS AND PLANS AND FISH DESERTS HAVE LIKE SCORPIONS AND SNAKES AND THE FORISTS HAVE LIKE BEARS AND LOOSE AND TREES
Line_12	IT SHOWS ME LIKE A FOX A BUNNY A HUMAN A BIRD UM LIKE BUG A FLOWER LIKE MUD AND GRASS OR LIKE I THINK THAT'S LIKE A MON
Line_13	A A FOOD WE
Line_14	IT IS WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS COULD GET EATEN BY LIKE AN ANIMAL'S FOOD AN ANIMAL'S PREDR LIKE LIKE SO IT SAY A BUNNY RABET IS LIKE FOOD FOR A SNAKE A SHOCK AND LIKE A LIKE MUSHROOM IS YEAH THERE'S MUSHROOMS AND THE LISEARD THERE IS LIKE BACTERIA GRASS BACTERIA'S FOOD FOR THE GRASS
Line_15	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_16	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER SOME FUNNY IS A DECOMPOSER AND GRASS IS A PRODUCER
Line_17	BI
Line_18	HOW ARE YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WOULD LIKE THE PLANT PLANS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MUNKIY AND THE CHALK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ARE ON THE THATERIA AND FUNGI IS AR LIKE THE COTHE D COMPOSERS
Line_20	PRODUCE MY OWN BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS VETAL IT MAY SINK ME IF I WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY OWL ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FUEL
Line_21	I WELL IRON LIKE HAVE MY OWN THROUGH AND LIKE FROM AN ANIMAL LIKE LIKE YOU SHE'LL LET SAY IF I WERE WELL SOMETHING LIKE A HARE I WOULD EAT THROUGH LIKE GLASS SOMETHING LIVING AND LIKE ONE OF MY PREDATORS WOULD BE LIKE A HOCK
Line_22	A D COMPOSER D CAN LIKE D COMPOSERS THERE WON'T CLUE LIKE UP LIKE UM BROUGHT IN FRUE OR AND PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_23	D COMPOSING ROUGHT IN FUOD AND THE FLUOD THAT THEY D COMPOSED GAVE THEM ENERGY
Line_24	SOME WILL SOME STUFF E LIKE MAYBE ANGLE IN BACKTERIA
Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PICTURES OF A D COME OF DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT BULB LIKE DOGEDMORNS KIND OF LIKE ON THE TOP THE FRONT IN
Line_27	OR ON THE VORE I THINK IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANT LIKE A YOU SAYS LIKE BERRIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A ONE OR EAT ALL WELL SO IF UM IS THE PREFICT OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO OMNIVORES ARE ANIMALS THAT EATS ALL THINGS LIKE MEATS FRUITS AND VECTABLES
Line_29	A KIND OF HARD
Line_30	EN MOST IS JE
Line_31	THAT HELPS THEM WITH THEIR FRUIT AND THAT IS PART OF AN EAGLE IS
Line_32	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_33	HOW ARE YOU
Line_34	HOW IT'S THE EST IT'S BELOW WIND UH WELL IT'S LIKE MAKING A BAD THITHER ANOTHER AT BECAUSE AS THE ANIMAL CRACKER IT STAN'T GO LIKE A UP
Line_35	IT MOST RUBBING THINGS IT DOES SHOULD JUST LIKE IT I FEEL ONE BECAUSE I COLD LIKE IT'S GATHER ABOUT R
Line_36	THE FACT THAT THAT IS LIKE MAYBE LIKE BEES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE MATERIAL IS SO LIKE BUT THAT'S LIKE BACTERIA FOR THEM
Line_37	THE CIRCLE ONE AT EITHER HILL IS FLY A ONE RIGHT IN IN A DARK BO WE CHIPPED OUR BRAINS TOO DAY AND THAT MARRY IT LOOKS LIKE AD HARACKARY THAT'S SO ONE BUT THE FIRST THEM THAT LOUD TO THEM DOWN IN THE L
Line_38	TROMADAR
Line_39	SOME WAYS
Line_40	L ACOLUTE NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS THIS ONE THING IT HELPS THEN MAKE IT WATER IT DON'T
Line_41	BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS LIVING THING AND IT NEEDS WATER YOU THING YOU CAN JUST IGNORE JUST SHAPE IT AND THEN THE BULB
Line_42	YES BECAUSE IT IS A BURGER UM THE THING TO BE COMPOSERS WHICH THEY NEED THIS KITTY DID NOT D COME IT BUT THEY MEAD TO LIKE BERGLEARS
Line_43	THAT PLANTS THE LIVING ON
Line_44	HA
Line_45	NOT
Line_46	NO BECAUSE PLANTS USE FIRTALIZER BUT THEY DON'T HALF TO USE IT
Line_47	USES
Line_48	IT MEEDS WIND IT MEAEDS SOIL IT MEEEDS UN AND IT MEEENS THOSE IMPORTANT STUFFS
Line_49	BY NEAT CARBONDYOGSIDE IN OCCIGIN AND WIDE S BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT HELPS THE SERVIVE AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE LIKE RYAN
Line_50	THEY ARE LEADING US
Line_51	WIND IT DOESN'T GET WATER AND A WIND NO ON OR CARPOSIDE WELL THAT'S ONLY JUST WHAT IT'S LIKE WHAT IT ES WATER WIND
Line_52	IT IS ALSO DYING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE LAST ONE BUT IT IS NOT GETTING ANY WATER AND THE LIKE IT ALSO SO IT NEEDS THAT MATERIAL AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY WATER IT'S THE ARGON WILL LIVE LIKE I PROCEED IT'S LIFT
Line_53	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_54	YES
Line_55	HE
Line_56	TOLAR OUT ONES
Line_57	IT'S T
Line_58	THESE ARE INDYVIDZIAL THWARDS ALL AND THEY MIGHT BE LIVING ALESEOULAVOU
Line_59	BECAUSE WE HAD DON'T BECAUSE A ABOUT A WA ONE THING AT THE
Line_60	RE BEAK
Line_61	FLASH
Line_62	ONES ARE JUST LIKE HUMAN ANIMALS OR JUST LIKE TWO MEN LIKE HUMANS ARE TWO AND THEY'RE ALLY THEY ALL MADE OUT OF SKIN CELLS BLOOD SELLS P ILLS
Line_63	THEY'RE BLOOD SEALS
Line_64	I SEE MAYBE PLANT WELL ELSE C A LEAF WELL THIS IS A PICTURE OF LEAF B OF LEAF S
Line_65	THE LEAF HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOOKING SELLS AND THE HUMAN HAS TO JUST LIKE THREE OR FOR ON ONE BUT THE HUMAN ALSO HAS MELTS THAT'S LOOKS IN DIFFERENT
Line_66	THEY NEED WINGS THEY NEED A BODY AR HEAD AND TENTHS YOU KNOW LIKE
Line_67	MY BONES ARE LUNG
Line_68	WEE DON'T
Line_69	RIDING DOWND
Line_70	IT'S A STUFF THAT PRODUCTS THE STICK SO IT'S LIKE OF THE ACID THE UM AND THAT IT AND IT BURNS DOWN TO SLOW
Line_71	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_72	A WELL WE WERE ARE RING ABOUT LIKE VS AND THE LIVING CITIZINO LIKE THE VAN MIX ZIDELAM AND FLOWE
Line_73	AN LEAF
Line_74	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE SHOES THEY LIKE DIFFERENT WHERE AS IT GOES THE LEAVES DIFFERENT SHAPE LIKE I REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WAS PARALLEL
Line_75	THERE THERE IS THREE TI REALIZE REMEMBER TWO OF THEM I DON'T WANT OF THEM WAS A PARALLEL UNNOW THERE IS PALMATE
Line_76	WELL THESE HAVE VAINS MIGHT THAT TRAVEL LIKE THE SAP OR SOME THAT EVERY THIS IS LIKE THE SAME THING HAS RAINS THAT R WILL IN ALL TWO PANTS
Line_77	ABOUT AMBLES AND HOW TRACT MOST OF THIS IS S AND HOWING GET NOTICED
Line_78	TRI SEE LIKE CUPS M SHAPE KIND OF AND AN I SEE LIKE A CANALREFRES AND STRAPS
Line_79	THE SMELLS
Line_80	IT USES ITS WEPED FEET TO UH LIKE PUSH WATER THAT MAKES IT SWING AND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES HELP BASICALLY CHOMP THE MEAT AND BREAK IT DOWN IN TO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOPLE GUESS LIKE A SO IT'S BASICALLY SHOWING IT UNDER LIKE THE ANOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU NO
Line_83	THE UH
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS TENDS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP A NE TENS OF LITTLE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE HUGE SISTOM
Line_85	THE CAR COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF AWAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO OUR SCIENCE PLAY OR SCIENCE SCIENCE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S A MOTOR AND LIKE WE ALS AND STUFF AND IN OF STUFF THAT MAKES IT A BIG STICITUM
Line_86	THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE EAST THEN THAT JUST SLIPS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT DON'T NEED IN THE CAR AND THE WEALES AND THE WEALES ARE WHAT MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_87	IT'S HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SISTOMS LIKE YOUR MUSCLES AND YOUR HEART AND YOUR LUNGS AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_88	IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BE W WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW LIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE WE WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HEART IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS US MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STUMMICH
Line_89	THE EARTH IS A SISTOM BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SPEERS LIKE HIDRAFC SPEER THE JEO SPEER AND THE BIO SPEER AND THE HIDRA AND THE ATMOSFEER BUT THE SO THOSE LITTLE SUB SISTOMS THEY MAKE UP ONE BIG SISTOM CALLED ERTH
Line_90	YES I DO THINK IT'S A SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE IS THE HIDROSFEER AND THE GEOSFEERRR AND THE ATMOSFEER AND THE BIO SFEER AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG SISTOM
Line_91	OK THE BIO SPEER IS THE LIFE AND TH AND LIKE THE TREES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND THE HIDROSFEER IS THE WATER AND WE AND THE BIOSFEER NEEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND THE ATMOSFEER IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKI SO AND THEN THE JEOSFEER IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEED THE JEO S THAT THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE JEOSFEER SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE HIDROSFEER WE AND THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE ATMOSFEER BECAUSE WE NEEDS SOME OF THE AIR THAT'S UP THERE AND THE HIDRAGOM POUCWHATEVER THE STUFF BREATH AND WE NEED THE HIDROSFEER BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD BE PUT OF THE BIO SPEER AND THE TREES THAT'S ALSO BE SPEER AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE JEOSFEER I CAN SEE THE SKY WHICH IS THE HITS NOT HIGH ATMOSFEER AND THEN THE WATER R UM ON THE BOTTOM IT THE HIDRO SPEER
Line_93	THE EARTH
Line_94	THERE ARE OR SIYSTUMS THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIDROSFEER AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECOND ONES THE JEOSFEER AND THAT'S THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BO SEE AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE IN TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOSFEERE I KNOW THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOSFEERE WHICH IS LIKE THE SKY
Line_95	I SEE A LOT OF LIKE UM BIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES AND THAT ONE SPOT LIKE ANIMALS OR TREES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITH OUT THE WET LANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER AND WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STUFF THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WETLANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HAVE TAP SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAR TO THE ANIMALS
Line_97	THERE IS LIKE FORIST AND STUFF WHICH AIRS USUALLY LIVE THERE S LIKE TENDRS WHICH IS LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACES WOULD PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HIDRESFEER WESN'T HERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE HIDRESFEER WE WOULD NEED UM THE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS S SNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE IS LIKE UM ANIMALS AND I THINK T'S A FOOD WEB BECAUSE THE THERE IS THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND THE THE GRASS EATS AND THEN THERE IS LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOODWEB
Line_99	FOULBLAINS A FOUND WAIT
Line_100	WHAT EATS WE AND WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATS WE AND WHAT DOESN'T EAT ANY THING AND IT JUST GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THE LIKE IT THE ARROWS MEAN WHAT EATS THAT ONE THING SO SORT IT JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DO IT LIKE IT SHOWS ME LIKE IF I HAVE LIKE A TEST OR SOMETHING AND IT SAID WHAT DOES THE BUNNY EAT I COULD LOOK AT OF FOOD WHEREVER AND IT SHOWS THAT BUNNIES EATS SCRASS SO IT SHOWS A IT SHOWS YOU WHAT IT EATS W AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE DUNG IS STUFF IN THE MILES AND GRASS AND PINE COINS AND STUFF
Line_103	M HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGUS M FUNGUS FUNGUS GETS EATEN BY PINE CONES AND PINS GET PINE CONES GET EATEN BY THE BARK BEDLES AND THE BARK BEDLES GET BY THE BY BY THE SALAMANDER AND THEN THE SALIMETORS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RAP AND THE AND THE RAPIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RAT ALSO GETS EATEN BY E HOT RED TAIL HOCKS AND THE AND SPERROWS ARE EATEN BY TAIL HOCKS SO IT'S SPASICALLY JUST THE BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS Y AND WHAT DOES IT W AND ALL SORTS OF ER CLOSE SINGERS
Line_104	FUN
Line_105	I'VE BEEN STUDYING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO A IN THE DARK OR IN THE LIGHT
Line_106	UM THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING CAUSE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE CERTAIN LIVE WORK SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS AND SYSTEMS THAT'S SINCE SINCE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AN HEN THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAT AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR YEAST IS STORM SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOOD IT WILL IT'LL BREATH AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IT WILL PROVE UP
Line_107	M THE ES E HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND THE EAST ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO AND IT'S DORMANT SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SCREE SOME WELL PUT AT THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN THE EAST WILL WAKE UP AND IT'LL STOP BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL POOF
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BREATHING BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE DOC IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BREATH AND WHEN THEY BREATH WHERE EVER THEY ARE IF IT'S IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BAG POOF UP SO ITS SHOW THAT THEY'RE BREETHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND IF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS ITS FOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO A BUBBLE UP ANALMOST SO MAY SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT JUST A WAY THAT WE WOULD MAYBE WE COULD WELL SINCE IT'S A LIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS E
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YELLOW AND SOON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN SO IT WILL SO IT'LL DIE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN SHINES ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE THEN SOMEONE'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THE THE THE WATER AND THE SUN AND GIVES IT IT'S FOOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLY WELL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER HELD AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THE UH MAKES IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS THEIR FOOD
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN THE PLANT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NEW TRANS FROM THE SOIL AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THES EARTH IF THE SUN GOES ON TO THE LEAF AND IT WILL OBSORBD THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE UM SHOOGER AND THAT'S FOOD
Line_115	UM I THINK THE PLANT UM MEANS THAT I DON'T WELL YOU I THINK THAT PLANT NEEDS THE AIR BECAUSE WELL I SIMPLY KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BREATH AIR O AND THE PLANTS UM THE PLAN UM THE PLANTS AND BREATHS OR SOMETHING BREATHS THE CARBONDIOCXIDE IN THAT WE BREATHE OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BREATHE THE AIR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BREATH THE CARBONDIOCIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND THE PLANTS NEED THE SUN TO SURVIVE BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN MIGHT THEY WON'T BE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THEM LOOK GREEN AND THE AND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS LIKE THEIR FOODS
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLAN PLANTS NEEDS SUN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN THEY CAN PRODUCE HUGER AND IF THEY CAN PRODUCE HIGAR WHICH IS THEIR FOOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBURGER AND A HAMBURGER IS SOMETHING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEED BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND THEY DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	UM IF WE DON'T FEED IT FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM UM IF IT WASN'T UM MAKING ITS OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED THE FIRTALIZER BECAUSE FIRTALIZER IT'S LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN AND WITHOUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NEW TRANS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEED A FRALIZER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND THE I THINK PLANTS ARE GO NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE USUALLY HAS A BACK YARD AND IF IT HAS A BACK YARD THAT MEANS THAT'S PROPERLY DIRT AND THAT'S SOMEWHERE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE SO
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE THE IF IT RAINS THAT GIVES THEM WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THAT WHEN IT'S SUNNY THAT IT GIVES THEM THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THEY'LL GET THE WATER AND PLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUNNY THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUN IT'S THE SUN GIVING OFF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANTS GETTING FROM THE COVERDIOCIDE AND AND NEW TRANS FROM THE DIRT AND ITS RUTS AND IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREETH
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DREANK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES IT IT GIVES IT ITS FOOD BECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH FOTO CYMTHECIS AND THE THE CARBDYOCIDE IT IT US THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BRETHS AND IT BRINGS OUT AND IT BREETHS OUT OCIGIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE BRETHE SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED IT BECOME DOCID CARBON DOCCIDE AND WHEN WE SPEEK WE LET SOME THEIR CARBON DOCCIDE OUT AND THEN THEY'LL PRODUCE OCIGIN FOR US
Line_130	THEY OBSORBED THE SUM AND THEY NEED THEIR CARBONARY OCCIDES SO THAT THEY CAN BREATHE AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SHOGER AND THAT SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY RED OUT THE OCIGON AND THAT'S THE STUFF WET BREATH
Line_131	YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT ER IN THEY MAKE THAT IN SOME FOOD AND THEN THEY BREATH A CAR ACID AND THEN THE WATER STRIPS THE WATER THROUGH THEM
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS AND PRODUCE SHOOGER BECAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT'S THE SHOOGER SO IT'S DIVING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN MAKE IT'S FOOD AND IF IT CAN'T MAKE ITS FOOD THEN IT CAN'T REALLY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TO TH ANYTHING TO CAN EAT IT'LL DIVE
Line_134	NOT AND SIN
Line_135	UM IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIND OR AIR AND WITHOUT THE WIND ER AIR IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH IT'S JUST GOING TO DIE
Line_136	IT CAN'T BREATHE SO IT DIES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVEL UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITHOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WE NEED WATER AND FOOD WATER FOOD AND AND OCIGON TO TO SERVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIVE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OCCIGEN AND THE WATER IT NEEDS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND IT CAN BREATHE SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	THE LAST THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THROUGH THE THINGS IT NEEDED SO THAT SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY THEY COULDN'T REALLY PRODUCE THEIR FOOD OR DRINK OR BREATH THE OCIGIEN THAT THEY NEED BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATH THE OCIGIEN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GO BE HEALTHIER THAN THOSE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT STARTS OUT AS WHAT IT EATS IT'S OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER ET MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD UM THAT AND IF IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOD I
Line_142	LIKE MAPLE TREES MAKE BELIEVE MAP BELEVES AND THEN THERE IS LIKE PARALLEL LEAVES AND THAT'S DISC LIKE THE VAN S AND THEN THERE IS THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WERE THERE IS ONE MAIN VAN AND VAINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THEN MORE VAINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN DATE ONE VAN COMING OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONES VAN ARE PARALLEL M THE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GOES STRAIGHT THE ONE THERE IS ONE VAN THAT GOES STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS AND THEN ONE HAS THERE IS MORE THAN LIKE ONE VAINVAIN BECAUSE THEN THE IS MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN ONE VAN COMING OUT OF IT BUT THEN THAT AT DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE HE'S JUST UM HAS A TU OF JUST TIN OF THE VAIN'S GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER TO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE MORE COMING OUT OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE ONE WHERE IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANY MORE EXCEPT FOR THAT C
Line_145	ON ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PARALLEL IS PARALLEL UM AND THEN OTHER TWO ART AND THEY THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE PARALLEL BUT UM THEN IT THERE IS ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN IN ONE AND THEN A FEW OTHER VAINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VAN BUT THEN NOTHING COMING OUT OF THE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE WITH A UM NO WITH THE MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS MORE VAINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	UM THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS PENNATE UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FEATHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THINGS COMING AND VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN THING BUT THAT NO VAINS COMING OUT OF THOSE ONES THAT AREN'T THE MAIN THING AND THEN PALMATE IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A UN OF VAINS ALL OVER SO THERE IS AND THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE'S EXTRA VAINS AND THEN PARALLEL IS JUST A TURN OF PARALLEL UM VAINS
Line_147	THIS IS THE THIS IS THE NESS IS THE PLANT AND IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN MORE VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN BEAN
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TYPES LEAVES UM PRODUCES MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SHOOGER AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS OR AND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_149	TO CARRY SHOOGER TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARRIES IT TO THE ROUTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROUTS CAN SEND IT UP IN MORE VAINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE BEAT ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RAINS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SHOOGAER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE BRAINS IN THE LEAVES HOW ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKES THE SHOGER FROM THE FOTOSYMTHECIS AND ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT PIECE OF THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOOD AND THEN SO THAT IT CAN FEED ITSELF ON EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VAINS AND ONE IS CALLED THE POLUM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SHOOGER TO THE PLANTS AND THE THE OTHER ONE IS THE SILUM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STAY IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP INTO THE REST OF THE PLANTS UM THROUGH ONE VAN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ZILUM AND THEN ALL THE NEW TRENDS AND SAP MAYBE AND SHOOGER IS GOING THROUGH THE THE FOLUM UM TO THE RUTS
Line_154	UM IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES IN EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLOOD WOOD IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THAT PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF AND EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT BEAN I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT'S JUST LETS THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT WAIST BE BECAUSE IN THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED INTO THE BAG BECAUSE THE PLANTS UM THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T RE CIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANT IT JUST UM EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S WATER ON THAT
Line_158	BI
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALSO KIND HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SYSTEMS AND H WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SCUNK IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND I TURNALS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND SO O
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COLORS AND SHAPES AND THE PROBABLY DIFFERENT SISTOIMS ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A WARNING NOT TO EAT ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IS PROPERLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO IT THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS IT'S WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL UM TURTALS THEY LIKE TO THEY UM THEY'RE UP ON LAM SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTLES CAN AND THEY KIND OF CAMIFLAS AMIFLAS SOMETIMES BUT UM YOU CAN SEE TURTAL LIKE TURTALWELL TURTALS THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTALS WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND SO SO THEY CAN SEE EACH OTHER UM AND THEN THE FISH ARE REALLY BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEAN DON'T EAT ME TO CREDITORS IN THE OTION OR THEY JUST WANT TO FIND MEAT AND THEN SCUNKS THEY HAVE WHIGHT THEIR WHIGHT AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLY TO SHOW HA DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR I'LL HEAVER STICK EVERYWHERE SO
Line_165	YES I DON
Line_166	UM PEOPLE THE ANIMALS DON'T WANT TO EAT THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED SO THAT HELPS THE SKUNK STAY ALIVE
Line_167	OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHELL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP CREDITERS FROM GETTING INTO IT SO IT CAN HIDE IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDATERS CAN'T EAT IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO I SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUE FEATHERS IF I SAW BLUE FEATHERS THAT BE AT ATTRACTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ALL SO ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HA I'M POISONOUS OR HA A MILE IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GOING TO SPRAY YOU OR YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I DON'T TASTE GOOD SOME LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT T
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DUCK DIDN'T HAVE FEET WEBBED FEET IT COULDN'T PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER AND IF IT COULDN'T PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO THAT THE FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIONS DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BE GUM AND WITHOUT IF AND WITHOUT THE TEETH IT THEY CAN'T EXACTLY LIKE GRAVEL AND ANTALOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD JUST KIND TO SMOKE IT A LITTLE IT
Line_171	BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TEETH IT'S JUST UM AND AND IT IN A LINE CAN'T BEIGHT THINGS TO KILL IT SO THAT YOU CAN EAT IT IT WITH JUST UM BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY SMASHTHE SEEM A LITTLE BIT I'D BE LIKE YOU COVERING YOUR TEETH WITH THE YOUR LIPS ALMOST THE BIGHTING YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH AS IF YOU JUST BIT IT
Line_172	THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HAD IT'S A SPECIAL DESINE THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT MIGHT EVEN LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN YE BUT THE BRIGHT COLORS MEAN HA YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I'M POISONESS EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE POISONSS
Line_173	RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE THEIR TAIL WHEN SOME OR SOMETHING GETS CLOSED BECAUSE THEN AND THEN THAT TELLS THEM HAY I'M HERE I DON'T STEP ON ME OR I MIGHT BIGHT YOU
Line_174	WELL A PERSON WALKED UP AND THEN RAP THE RATTLE SICK SHAKING ITS TAIL AND BY SHAKING THE TAIL ITS TAIL THAT WARNED THE PERSON NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER BECAUSE THE SNAKE MIGHT STRIKE
Line_175	THE HUMAN KNOWS THAT IF IT GETS ANY CLOSER THE RATTLE SNAKE WILL STRIKE AND BRIGHT YOU AND IF IT LIGHTS YOU IT PUTS POISON IN YOU SO THAT COULD KILL YOU ALL MOST SO IF YOU HEAR THE SNAKES RATTLE TAIL IT MEANS DON'T COME ANY CLOSER BY YOUR
Line_176	IF THE PERSON WALKS UP IT SHAKES ITS TAIL SO THE PERSON STOPS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT TO GET BE BECAUSE IF IT BIGHTS HER SHE COULD DIE AND THAT KEEPS THE SNAKE SAFE BECAUSE IT L DOES IT FOR ALL PRODUCERS

Line_20	THIS SHOWS US CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSERS
Line_21	HE COMPOSERS CONSUMERS S AND PRODUCERS
Line_22	WHEN THEY EAT THE RUDE THE ANIMALS DI THEIR ENERGY
Line_23	CONSUMERS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND CONSUMERS CAN GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS

Line_428	IT HELPS YOU SWALLOW DOWND THE FOOD AND YEAH
Line_429	THAT'S WHERE IRON IF FOOD GOES
Line_430	THEY ALSO HELPS YOU DIGEST YOUR FOOD
Line_431	ABOUT LIKE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES AND LIKE THE DIFFERENT NAMES AND ABOUT THE ROUTS IN THEM LEAVES
Line_432	THAT THERE IS A PINNAY A POLMAY AND A PARALLEL
Line_433	ALL THE ROUTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEIR SHAPE IS A DIFFERENT
Line_434	THERE IS THREE KINDS OF VAIN THERE IS POMIC PINNATE AND PARALLEL
Line_435	ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND UM HOW YOUR FOOD DIGEST AND HOW YOU BREATH
Line_436	YOU'RE A SOFIUS AND YOUR MOUNT
Line_437	THEY ALL HELP YOU LIKE DIGEST YOUR FOOD
Line_438	THE LONG SNOWS MOUTH UM BRONCHI DIEFRAN
Line_439	BECAUSE IF YOU COULDN'T BREATHE YOU WANNA BE ALIVE HAND
Line_440	THAT THIS IS LIKE HOW IT GOES THROUGH H
Line_441	IT GETS THE BREATHING FOR ANIME HUMANS
Line_442	THEY HELP YOU LIKE PUMP AIR OUT OF YOUR SUISTOM AND THEN BACK AGAIN
Line_443	THAT LIKE IT'S UM LIKE THAT LONG BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING YOU PUMP AIR AND PUMP IT OUT
Line_444	BRONCHI BRONCLES
Line_445	UM HELPING PUMP THE AIR AND YOUR LUNGS AND
Line_446	THEY IT GETS A RED OF ALL THE BAD AIR
Line_447	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_448	ABOUT LIKE UHM LIKE LUNGS AND HOW WE BREATHE
Line_449	IT WE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW ANIMALS LIKE USE ATTRACTIONS TO CALL MATES OR SEEN DANGER
Line_450	THAT THEY ALL CALL FOR MATES AND SENDS DANGER AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW AND THEY TRY TO GET AWAY FROM PREDDLERS AND YEAH
Line_451	WELL THE SKUNK WILL USE ITS SMELL BECAUSE IT STINKS LIKE REALLY THAT IT WILL USE ITS SMELL TO MAKE PREDATORS GO AWAY
Line_452	IT IS LIKE ONE OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS THAT IT LUNGS IN WITH THE SAND SO IF ONE OF ITS PEDLERS COME BY IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
Line_453	WELL IT'S LIKE COULD BLEND INTO THE CORAL
Line_454	THE THE FEET IT'S LITTLE TINY LITDOW CUTE LITTLE FEET
Line_455	BECAUSE IT HAS LIKE THE RIGHT KIND OF WEB KIND OF AND LIKE IT IT'S REALLY LIKE IT HELPS IT PUSH
Line_456	NUMBER TODA S BECAUSE THEY'RE CANINE TEETH AND THEY REALLY SHARP AND HELPS THEM LIKE CHOO IT UP
Line_457	I THINK THAT IT'S WEAINS DO SO IT COULD FLY A WAY
Line_458	BECAUSE LIKE THEIR SHOW BRIGHT AND THEY HA THEIR WINGS IT CAN HELP IT FLIES AWAY FROM PREDATORS
Line_459	WELL SHE'S LIKE LIKE THE SNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL WITH HIS RATTLE
Line_460	WELL SO THE HUMAN DOESN'T GET HURT HE'S JUST GIVING HER A SIMPLE WOR
Line_461	WELL THE SNAKE IS THE STIMULUS AND THE GIRLS IS THE REACTION
Line_462	WELL THE THE SCONCH IS LIKE MAKING HIS SMELL SO THE CIOTY WILL GO AWAY FROM
Line_463	THAT HIS SMELL IS LIKE SKUNK SMELLY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY
Line_464	IT COULD HAVE REALLY WEARED REACTIONS
Line_465	'S ABOUT STIMULUS IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ACTUALLY LIKE REACTIONS AND STUFF
Line_466	THAT THEY'LL SHOW A STIMULI IS AND AND REACTION I RE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_467	THEY'RE LIKE MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET COLD ON WHERE THEY ARE O WHERE THEY ARE
Line_468	INSTINCT DULL BEHAVIOR
Line_469	WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE SAYING LIKE GO WAY KILL I JUST GOT THAT ON SPEAKER MAKE A S
Line_470	NO IT ISN'T A LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A REACTION
Line_471	YES WE DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO RIGHT BECAUSE I IT'S NOT INSTINCTIVE IT'S A LEARNING THING
Line_472	WE'VE BEEN DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
Line_473	SALAD IS MIXED WITH VETABLES
Line_474	THEY ARE MIXED WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_475	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT
Line_476	ITS TAKES BETTER WHEN IT'S MIXED
Line_477	THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_478	THE MARBLES ARE STUCK IN THE THING YOU HAD THE WATER RIGHT IN THE BUBBLE
Line_479	FORM THE SCREEN THE SAND FALLS ON THE SCREEN SO THEN THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
Line_480	THE SAND IS NOT GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_481	UM I I CAN FORGOT I'M SORRY
Line_482	THE SALT EVAPORATES OR C OR DISSOLVES
Line_483	UM MAYBE I DON'T KNOW NATUALLY
Line_484	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT EVAPORATES THE WATER STILL S STAYS AS SALT WATER
Line_485	IT'S TURNING INTO A MIXTURE BUT SALT DISSOLVES AND IF IT WOULD HAS SAND IT WOULD NOT GO INTO THE WATER AND THE SCRE
Line_486	SALTS OR THE SOLUTION
Line_487	YES YOU COULD PUT THE GRAPE JUTS BACK IN THE CAN BUT UM THE WATER WOULD THE GRAM USE WOULD BE PURIFIED WITH WATER
Line_488	UM
Line_489	THERE IS MOID MADE FROM SAND AND WATER
Line_490	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAID SOME C
Line_491	IT DISSOLVES
Line_492	I LIKE TAKES
Line_493	WHAT IS A SIUTE I DON'T KNOW A SIUTE IS SO PLEASED TELL ME WITH A SIGOKAY
Line_494	WHAT IS A DILUTE
Line_495	IT IS A SOLUTE
Line_496	SALT SALT SALT VENTERME LIKE
Line_497	TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU A REAL PERSON OR IS THIS JUST LIKE AN ANIMATED RUB
Line_498	UH THE SOLUTION
Line_499	CAN YOU PLEAASE ANSWER ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_500	REPEAT THAT
Line_501	T IS PERFECTLY BALANCED
Line_502	WE HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT
Line_503	UM OF A MIXTURE IN SOLUTION A PROPERLY
Line_504	WE HAVE NOT LEARNED WHAT A SOLUTE MEANS YES SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT A SOLUTE MEANS YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR ME PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A SOLUTE IS
Line_505	IT MEANS THAT CREATES A SOLUTION AT THE END BECAUSE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SALT INTO THE CUP
Line_506	A SOLUTIONS WHAT
Line_507	A MIXTURE AH MIXTURE A MIXTURE
Line_508	IT'S A MIXTURE NOW BUT THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH SO DOESN'T IT CREATE A SOLUTION
Line_509	ITS CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_510	A A SOLUTION
Line_511	M MIXTURE
Line_512	UM I DON'T ME
Line_513	ITS IS CREATING A MIXTURE
Line_514	THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
Line_515	UM IT IS UM THEY TURN TO CRYSTALS LIKE SALT CRYSTALS I THINK SO THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_516	CREATE A MIXTURE
Line_517	UHM THE PERSON WAS MIXING IT UP
Line_518	UM I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
Line_519	UM I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TIME IT TAKES TIME FOR IT TO EVAPORATE
Line_520	UM TODAY WE TOOK THE SALT CRYSTALS MIXTURES ON SOLUTIONS
Line_521	BE
Line_522	MIXTURE'S
Line_523	SOLUTIONS
Line_524	USING A A SCREEN AND OR A MAGNET OR A FUNNEL
Line_525	WHAT DID YOU STUDY MA
Line_526	WHAT DID YOU SAY MOM
Line_527	WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT THE MIXTURES MARNEY
Line_528	I THINK THE IMPORT IM PROPERTY OF THIS PICTURE IS A MASS
Line_529	THE IT IT IS A MAGNET IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_530	CAN'T ASKS YOU A QUESTION MARNEY
Line_531	LOOKS LIKE THE SAME EXAMPLE TO ME THE SO IT SEEMS LIKE NATURE
Line_532	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES ARE TYPES OF GASSES SOME ARE SOLID AND SOME ARE LIQUIDS
Line_533	UM I THINK IT'S THE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE METAL IN IT AND MAGNETS ATTRACTING METAL
Line_534	MARNEY WOOD IS UM E AS
Line_535	UM I THINK IT COULD BE SALT
Line_536	UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS PLEASE TO ME WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_537	A A SOLUTION
Line_538	UM BYE TALKING TOOK
Line_539	NOT GOOD NOT GOOD I NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_540	MMM WE UM HA WHAT ARE WE DO IN SCIENCE
Line_541	T IS THAT MOLD ON THE RIGHT CUP I DON'T KNOW THAT IT LECTUALLY GROWS
Line_542	I'M JUST JUST SAYING IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A
Line_543	THE ROCK WEIGHS EITY TWO MORE NO WA I MEAN TO IN THE ROCK WEIGHS UM EITY EIGHT MORE GRAMS THAN THE FEATHER
Line_544	WHAT IS IT WHAT IS A SOLUTE
Line_545	UHM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHS HEAVIER
Line_546	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT S
Line_547	U MOST CONCENTRATE IS SOLUTION TWO
Line_548	UM THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE THE ONE METAL
Line_549	THE MOST DILUTED LOOK LIKE A SOLUTION THREE
Line_550	UH GOOD BYE WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN
Line_551	NOTE GOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_552	I DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE LAST MONDAY AND LAST TIME WE DID SCIENCE WAS EITHER ON FRIDAY OR THIRTY SO I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_553	IT LOOKS LIKE A CORK FLOWING ON THE TOP OF WATER AND THE PENNY HA SUNK TO THE WATER IN THE WATER
Line_554	THEY FLOW AND SOME DON'T FLOW
Line_555	OLD CUTTLLY DOE
Line_556	SOLUTION B HAS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS IT UP LIKE SALT BECAUSE SALT CAN KEEPS THINGS UP
Line_557	UM YEAH I SAI I AGREE
Line_558	IT'S IT'S UH
Line_559	IT TEN COMES FIFTY YEAH IT BECOMES A HUNDRED MILLILITERS A
Line_560	UM THE BLUE ONE IS MORE DENSE SO IT FLOWS ON TOP THE YELLOW LIQUID
Line_561	UM IT'S VERY CONCENTRATE
Line_562	BIT HAS MOST GRAMS OF SALT
Line_563	THE BLUE ONE HAS THE MOST GRAMS AND THAT MAKES IT MORE ON
Line_564	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE DENSE AND ONE IS LESS DENSE SENSE ONE IS THE GREEN AND THE MORE DENSE ONE IS
Line_565	HI HOW YOU'D DOING TODAY
Line_566	HUH IT'S ABOUT SALT AND WATER
Line_567	HM YEAH BYE
Line_568	I NOTICED THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIN
Line_569	AH UM SO IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATION NOW BECAUSE IT'S THREE SCOOPS OF
Line_570	DENSE IS SO THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN
Line_571	IT'S NOT CONCENTRATED T EVERY TIME
Line_572	I I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_573	YOUR GOING TO ANSWER ME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ME AND I ONLY ANSWER THE QUESTION S
Line_574	IT A CERIMALE CENICT WITH IT
Line_575	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WOULD BE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS IN THE WASHERS
Line_576	UH UH THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE WOULD BE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED B
Line_577	UH THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE MOST THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS INSIDE OF THE CAME
Line_578	UM I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ONE OF THEM AS CONST
Line_579	UM IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CONSTANT
Line_580	THE ONE ON THE METAL SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CO
Line_581	UH IT TALKS LIKE SUBST
Line_582	UH UP SINCE THERE
Line_583	UM THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES AND DIFFERENT UM UH DIFFERENCES LIKE LIKE UM WE YOU CAN DESCRIBE THEM DIFFER
Line_584	UHM THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THEY
Line_585	IT WOULD BE A EPSOM SALT
Line_586	MUST BE- EPSOM SALT IT MUST BE
Line_587	WE DID SCIENCE UM A A COUPLE DAYS AGO SO I FOR I FORGOT UH
Line_588	YOU'RE MIXING CHEMIL REACTION AND MIXING IT EXPLODE FLOWE D
Line_589	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_590	UH IT'S THE PRODUCTS
Line_591	UM REPEATS
Line_592	UM I THINK THE BEST ONE WOULD BE THE CALCION CORD BASE
Line_593	UM MEMBERS
Line_594	UM A IT BECOMES THE PRODUCT
Line_595	BOOK'S LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN IT
Line_596	UM THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT UM B
Line_597	THE MOW N MOLECULES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_598	UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_599	UM THEY WE'RE COLLECT THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_600	MIX PRODUCT OR A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_601	UM THERE ARE CHEMICALS CALLED BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLOR
Line_602	ONE IT BUBBLES UP
Line_603	THE PRECIPITATE GOES TO THE BOTTLE
Line_604	THE SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE DISSOLVES
Line_605	THERE ARE DIFFERENT PIPES OF MOLECULES AND ALL
Line_606	UM IT JUST DISSOLVES
Line_607	UM IT DISSOLVES LIKE OUR HEAPS B
Line_608	UM I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME UM AFTER THE CHEMICALS ARE PUT IN SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN
Line_609	UH IT MADE BUBBLY
Line_610	UH UM I DON'T THINK THE CHEMICALS WATER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WOULD BE WATER ON THE OUTSID
Line_611	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS UM A NEW CAM
Line_612	BY SOMEONE IS DUMPING WATER INTO A GLASS
Line_613	UM IT MIGHT
Line_614	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OR
Line_615	CAUSES RUST
Line_616	E TUB WITH GREEN LIQUID MADE THE WATER TRUNGAR
Line_617	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE BENDING A GLOW STICK THAT'S HOLD
Line_618	UH THERE IS CHEMICAL REACTION TAKING O
Line_619	UH YEAH TOTALLY Y
Line_620	UH I WANT TO SEE THAT I
Line_621	H YOU'RE ADDING THE GRAPES TASTIC INTO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT BE A DIFFERENT CA
Line_622	YES THERE IS I TH
Line_623	TO DA AND ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS CA MIXED TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_624	MY DOING WELL TODAY MARRY GOOD
Line_625	UH IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SAY IMPORTANT DO YOU MEAN PORING TO THE ERTH OR LIKE TO THE EXPERIMENT
Line_626	I NOTICED THAT IT BLEW UP SO I THINK IT MADE OCGIEN
Line_627	I THINK THOSE CHEMICALS ARE CREATED CREATING OCIGINHIDRGE POSE A
Line_628	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_629	IT LOOKS LIKE UM IT GETS HEAVIER WHEN YOU UM ADD MORE CHEMICAL S
Line_630	UH TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE IT GOES SIXTY AND SIXTY GRAMS
Line_631	UM I THINK WAIT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_632	THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO EACH OTHER
Line_633	IRE TO SAY I AGREED WITH YOU OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I'M DOING GOOD
Line_635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_636	THEY ARE ALL TWO OR MORE THINGS THAT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_637	SOME ARE FOOD AND SOME ARE OTHER ITEMS
Line_638	HALF OF THEM ARE FOOD AND HALF OF THEM ARE OTHER MIXTURES S
Line_639	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THEN ONE ON RIGHT ARE A BUNCH OF SEPARATE ITEMS
Line_640	IT IS A MIXTURE AND WHEN WE DO IT IT WILL MAKES TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
Line_641	I WOULD CALL THESE MIXTURES
Line_642	IT GETS SOR IT OUT INTO THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS AND THEN IT IS NOT A MIXTURE
Line_643	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED AND NOW ARE NOT A MIXTURE THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT ITEMS
Line_644	THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED
Line_645	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND CREATED A SOLUTION
Line_646	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_647	A A SOLUTION
Line_648	MARNEY I CAN SEE THE PICTURE
Line_649	MARIA CAN'T SEE THE VIDDIO
Line_650	NO MARNEY I DON'T KNOW THE M
Line_651	MARNEY I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
Line_652	A A SOLUTE
Line_653	THAT NOTHING EVAPORATES OR DISAPPEAR RES
Line_654	THAT NOTHING DISAPPEARS OR EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR
Line_655	BY EVAPORATING THE LIQUID AND JUST LEAVING THE SOLIDS
Line_656	I I MEAN A MIXTURE NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_657	I I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER ALL THE WAY SO IT WAS ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
Line_658	THIS MEANS THAT IT THE WATER AND THE SALT ARE THE SOLUTE AR A SOLUTION
Line_659	THAT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE NOT A SOLUTION
Line_660	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER MEANING THAT IT WAS A SOLUTIONS
Line_661	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE LIQUID TO TO SEPARATE A SOLUTIONS
Line_662	IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE AND LEAVE THE SALT B
Line_663	GOOD BYE UH MARNEY
Line_664	I'M DOING EXLENT AND GOT GRADE SLEEP LAST NIGHT
Line_665	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_666	YOU CAN SORT IT OUT WITH YOUR HAN
Line_667	YOU CAN USE A FUNNEL OR A SCREEN
Line_668	THERE IS A DRY MIXTURE AND A MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF IT
Line_669	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE ROCKS AND THE WATER
Line_670	HAT'S A SEED
Line_671	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND I THINK THE SAND D
Line_672	THE MAGNET PULLED THE PAPERCLIPS OUT OF THAT MIXTURE
Line_673	A SIEVE AND A MAGNET
Line_674	BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS AND THE WATER SO A SEE WOULD CATCH THE ROCKS ON TOP WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_675	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE A METAL IN THEM AND SOME MIXTURES HAVE BIG OBJECTS AND SMALL OBJECTS IN THEM
Line_676	BECAUSE THE MAGNET WOULD GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT AND LEAVE THE REST ON THERE
Line_677	I NOTICE THAT ONLY THE ROCKS WENT THROUGH THE SEED NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE TWO SMALL
Line_678	UN PLEASED FILTER BECAUSE ITS HOLES ARE BIG ENOUGH THAT WATER CAN GO THROUGH BUT SMALL ENOUGH THAT SAND CAN NOT
Line_679	BY MARNEY SEE YOU WHENEVER I SEE YOU AS LIKE THE NEXT TIME WE DO AN EX SCIENCE EXPERIMENT TOGETHER
Line_680	A SOLUTE STATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_681	I THINK IT'S CALLED SOMETHING LIKE A HU TATION OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_682	BECAUSE IT WILL EITHER BE DARKER OR LIGHTER
Line_683	ONE ONLY HAS TWO PURPLE CRYSTAL SHARKS AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTAL SHARKS
Line_684	ONE OF THEM HAS TWO CRYSTALS OF POWDER AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTALS OF POWER
Line_685	I THINK THAT HE'S IS TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE MORE DILUTE THE LIGHTER AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED THE DARKER
Line_686	THERE IS MORE GRAPE TANK POWDER AND THE DARKER ONE AND LESS GRAPE DRINK POWDER AND THE L
Line_687	WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTIONS BY ADDING WATER TO IT
Line_688	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER OR NOT PUT AS MUCH WATER INTO SEE
Line_689	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER
Line_690	YOU CAN WEIGH EACH OF THEM IF YOU HAVE S AMOUNT AND SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE AND THAT ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_691	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE THAN TWO AND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE TWO WEIGHTS MORE THAN ONE
Line_692	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME YOU DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
Line_693	ITS WILL FLOW
Line_694	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOW BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE I ALSO
Line_695	THE ONE THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW AND THE ONE THAT IS MORE DENSE WILL SINKS
Line_696	THE ONE THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED WILL SINK AND THE ONE THAT IS LESS CONCENTRATE WILL FLOW
Line_697	IT WILL FLOW E INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_698	OU
Line_699	BECAUSE THE DENSER ONES KEPT THE LIGHTER ONES WEIGH DOWN AND ENDED OUT MIXING WITH IT
Line_700	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION B ARE FLOWING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_701	BYE MARNEY I CAN WAIT TO DO MY NEXT EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU
Line_702	I'M GRAY HOW I UH
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT IT'S A SATURATED SOLUT
Line_704	WE NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN DISSOLVES IN WATER OF COURSE WATER AND SOMETHING TO PUT THE SOLID INTO THE WATER WITH
Line_705	WE PUT IN SEVERAL SCOOPS OF SALT UNTIL THE WIRE COULDN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT SO IT WAS SATURATED
Line_706	M THERE'S SO MUCH SALT IN THE WATER THAT THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_707	AFTER THREE SCOOPS IT IT BEAD THE WATER BECAME SATURATED AND THE EPSOM SALT WENT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_708	IT'S TAKING A LOT LONGER TO BECOME SATURATED
Line_709	IT LETS THE REST OF IT STICK TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE SHOWER IS ADDING YOU CAN AD
Line_710	THE SH TOOK LONGER TO B TO SATURATE THE THAN THE CITRIC ACID
Line_711	THE WATER IS RISING AS YOU PUT IN MORE SALT
Line_712	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_713	I'M DOING SAD READY FOR SCIENCE I GOT YOU
Line_714	WHEN YOU MIXED THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT STARTED FIZZING CUP
Line_715	WE ARE GOING TO MIX MORE ONE OF MORE THAN ONE OF THESE WITH WATERS
Line_716	REACTIONS AND A PRODUCTS
Line_717	VINEGAR OR WATER
Line_718	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT SO THEY CHEMICALLY CHANGED D
Line_719	THE REACTING MOLECULES WHEN MIXED CHEMICALLY CHANGED D
Line_720	BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER
Line_721	THERE ARE TWO PURPLE MOLECULES AND ATE A ON OF STILL BATTER MOLECULES
Line_722	NO BECAUSE THEY HAVE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND BASICALLY CREATED ONE NEW SUBSTANCE
Line_723	THE CARBONATED WATERS STARTED FIZZING UP
Line_724	THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FILLING UP WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO THE CUP
Line_725	THE GREENS SUBSTANCE WENT INTO THE WATER AND TURNED ALL THE WATER GREEN
Line_726	MEAL CHEMICAL REACTION IS A CURRENT BECAUSE THE WATER IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE DRUM SUBSTANCE
Line_727	THE SUBSTANCE ON THEIR GLOW STICKS THAT'S GLOW
Line_728	THE WATER CHEMICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THE GRAPES THAT TASTE DICK IS MIXED WITH IT
Line_729	NO BECAUSE THE GRAPES THE PAY STICK IS JUST GOING INTO THE WATER NOT CHEMICALLY CHANGES
Line_730	BYE HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT LATER WHEN I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MORE SCIENCE
Line_731	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_732	I SEE THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER FOR THE REACTION TO CREATE A NEW SUBSTANCE
Line_733	I SAW A NEW PRODUCT AT THE BOTTOM I
Line_734	THEY MADE IT FIT UP AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
Line_735	AND THAT THERE IS A CHEMICAL CHANGE
Line_736	THAT NOW WEIGHT IS LOST
Line_737	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOSS
Line_738	THE BAG THAT WAS OPEN LED OUT THE GAS THAT IS CREATED AND THE BAG THAT IS CLOSED KEPT THE BASS AND MAKING IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_739	THE OPEN BAG IS LOWER I WEIGHS LESS THAN THE CLOSED BAG
Line_740	BECAUSE THE OPEN BAG LEFT OUT LET THE GAS GO OUT AND THE CLASBAGE DIDN'T
Line_741	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_742	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_743	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS IN THEM
Line_744	THHAS THE SALAD
Line_745	IT HAS EVERYTHING IN IT THAT MAKES IT A MIXTURE
Line_746	IT IS CALLED A MIXTURE WHEN ONE OR MORE IN TWO OR MORE THINGS ARE COMPARED TO
Line_747	A A MIXTURE
Line_748	IT IS NOT COMPARE WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALTOGETHER IT IS COLD
Line_749	THEY WERE TOOKEN OUT OF THEIR S
Line_750	THEY WERE TOOKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURE AND NOT KEPT TOGETHER ANY E
Line_751	THEY WERE TOOKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURES AND NOT KEPT TOGET
Line_752	WHEN TRYING TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE SCREEN THEY WERE NOT PUT IN BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BY
Line_753	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THEM FROM THE WATER
Line_754	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE SAND AND WASHER
Line_755	THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER INTO A MIXTURE AND THEN SEPARATED
Line_756	IT BECAME A MIXTURE AND THEN WAS SEPARATED
Line_757	WHEN IT DISSOLVES IT BECOMES PART OF THE OTHER MIXTURE IT CREATES ONE BIG SOLID
Line_758	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_759	A MORE ROLES THAT THEY HAVE IN CREATING THE SOLUTION IS WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE DISSOLVES
Line_760	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_761	THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WAS DISSOLVED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THE SALT WAS TOKENS BY THE WATER AND THE S
Line_762	A DISSOLVATIO
Line_763	NO I DO NOT THINK SO BECAUSE IF AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND I
Line_764	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SALT AND WATER BEING MIXTURES AND D
Line_765	THAT WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER TOGETHER IT JUST MIXES BROWN MUD WATER AND HEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER IT MAKES A CLEAR SOLID AND LIQUID
Line_766	WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SALTS IS THAT WHEN THE SAND AND WATER WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE IT WAS DISSOLVED
Line_767	I THINK THAT THE WATER AND THIS SOLUTION IS PLAYING THE LIQUID BECAUSE THE GRAPE TASTIC S IS A SOLID
Line_768	I THINK THAT IT IS CALLED IT IS SOLVENT
Line_769	I THINK THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT IN ITS MIXTURE AND ITS POSITION IS THE SOLID IN THIS P
Line_770	WE CALL THE THING THAT IS THE DISSOLVING A DISSOLVENT
Line_771	THE MASS OF THE STUFF GOING IN GRA
Line_772	THE MASS IS CREATING A LARGER AMOUNT BECAUSE OF MORE MIXTURE'S BEING BROUGHT INTO
Line_773	MARNEY THIS DOESN'T MAKE S
Line_774	WHAT IS THE TERM MARMEWYMA
Line_775	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_776	WHAT'S UP THIS A REPEAT
Line_777	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND IT BECAME A MIXTURE SOLUTION
Line_778	WHAT IS THIS OBJECTS MARNEY
Line_779	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_780	WE MARNEY THE WATER IS DISAPPEARING FROM EACH DISH BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING THE SALT IS SHRINKING INTO THE WATER
Line_781	MARNEY WHAT IS DICIPATHING MEAN
Line_782	MARNEY CAN USE HUMAN ON THE PICTURE PLEASE
Line_783	MARNEY CAN WE GO OVER THIS WHOLE TEST AGA
Line_784	YOU TOO MARNEY HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU'RE MY BEST RE
Line_785	ONE WAY WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE IS USING A SCREEN ANOTHER IS MAKING A FUNNEL
Line_786	A MIXTURE IS A MIX SOMETHING OF TWO OR MORE OBJECTS MIXED TOGETHER MAKING A COMBONATI
Line_787	THE OBJECT AND WATER IS BEING SEPARATED FROM WITH FROM A SCRE
Line_788	MARNE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MISS
Line_789	MONEY WHEAT IS PROPER
Line_790	THEY WENT ABOUT USING A MAGNET IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAGNET USES MAGNETISM TO GET THE MAGNETS IN
Line_791	MARNEY I CAN SU A PICTURE
Line_792	MARNE I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_793	WHAT IS IS THEE
Line_794	BE CAUSE THE MAGNETISM WOULDN'T BE AS STRONG
Line_795	I THINK WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE IT HELPS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUC
Line_796	I THINK WE USED A MAGNET BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAN WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ST
Line_797	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL SEPARATED FROM FROM THE SAND BECAUSE IT IS A BIGGER OBJECT OBJECT AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_798	I THINK WE USE A FILTER THAT THE WATER COULD GO THROUGH AND THE SAND TO NOT
Line_799	EAR'S YOU
Line_800	I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WENT ON AND SEPARATING THEM THROUGH THE MIXTUR
Line_801	MY BEST FRIEND BYE MARNEY MARNEY CAN YOU KEEP TALKING TO ME
Line_802	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DILUTION AND CONCENTRATE LIQUIDS THAT HAVE BEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_803	WELL TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MIXTURE AND THEN SOMEHOW SEPARATE THE MIXTURE
Line_804	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_805	THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_806	BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS THE CONCENTRATED ONES
Line_807	IT WOULD TASTE NOT AS STRONG AND A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AN
Line_808	BY ADDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
Line_809	BY ADDING MORE WATER TO A A DIFFERENT CUP
Line_810	BECAUSE YOU COULD ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THEN DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_811	THE AND THE PURPLE AND THE BLUE ONE CUPS IS CONCENTRATED AND ONE IS DILUTED
Line_812	I CAN SEE THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO CUPS OF SALT WATER SOLUTION THAT ONE HAS TEN GRAMS SOLUTE AND THE OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SALT
Line_813	THE ONE OF TWENTY GRAMS SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THEN THE ONES TEN GRAMS SO BECAUSE IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS
Line_814	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_815	BECAUSE OF THE TWENTY GRAMS AND THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE BEING COMPARED WILL BE THE TWENTY GRAMS TO BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IS TEN MORE GRAMS SO
Line_816	I THINK WE HAVE PRODUCED THE AMOUNT THE MASS AND SOLUTE IS THAT THE AMOUNT HAS GREATER AN EXPERIMENT THAN THIS
Line_817	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_818	SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION ONE
Line_819	SOLUTION ONE SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTR
Line_820	SOLUTION THREE SOLUTION ONE IS THE MUST COME STRAIT INTO THE SOLUTION THREE THE LEAST COST
Line_821	SOLUTION A FIRST SOLUTION
Line_822	THE SOMETHING IS MORE DENSE AN WE DROP INTO THE TIN IT WILL FLOW ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_823	I THINK THIS MEANS A SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT AND SOLUTION A
Line_824	WELL IT WOULD DEPEND ON IF IT HAD SALT OR NO
Line_825	THEY DID NOT BLEND THEY DID NOT BLEND AND THEY DO NOT LEARN
Line_826	I THINK THAT IS HAPPENING THAT SINCE THEY'RE NOT BLENDING IT'S CAUSING A FORM OF CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION
Line_827	IT WOULD NOT BLEND AND IT WOULD LOOK CONSTANT FROM CONCENTRATED TO DILUTION
Line_828	NOT BENDING
Line_829	SOME ONE EITHER ADDED TO MIX PRESSURE OR YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EACH
Line_830	IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF TEN GRAMS OR S
Line_831	I NOTICED THAT BLUE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED T AND THEN RED IS A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND THEN GREEN IS
Line_832	THAT THE BLUE IS TELEGRAM SO IT'S THE HEAVIEST SO IT S THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS THE SECOND CONCENTRATED AND THEN GREEN IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_833	BECAUSE THE BLUE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND GREEN IS A THE LIGHT
Line_834	HELOW CORN
Line_835	IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE FORE SCOOPS IS MORE AND THE THREE SCOOPS MAKES IT MORE
Line_836	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN DILUT
Line_837	WELL IT DID NOT DISSOLVE ALL THE WAY I
Line_838	WELL I THINK ANGLES AND TWO THIRTY SIX FORTY EIGHT TWELVE SO I THINK PIN THREE IS THE TWENTIES ONE AND THEN UM THIRTY SIX A SOME THIS ONE AND THEN SOME
Line_839	TH SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST LEADING AND
Line_840	THE CRYSTALS GOT AWAY
Line_841	WELL THE CRYSTALS WOULD NOT MAKES CLEAR
Line_842	WELL THEY GO IN CLEARLY TO THE DITCH AND N DON'T COME OUT
Line_843	DULT CRYSTALS WOULD BE THE MOST DENSITY
Line_844	M WELL THE
Line_845	WELL EVAPORATED TOGETHER AND MAKING IT ALL MIXTURED THE RE PRODUCTION
Line_846	UH IT IS A PRODUCT CAN BYE MY TE LADY
Line_847	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_848	IT MAKES IT A SALT CRYSTAL IT IT'S A STARTED OUT OF
Line_849	PRECIPITATION IS HAPPENING AND IT MAKES ITS MOIST ONE AND LIKE SATURATE THE SOLVENTS INTO PRISCIPIT
Line_850	AND THEN YOU MAKE THE PRECIPITATION GO
Line_851	IT ON SENSE WELL IT HANDS OVER AND IT MAKES PESIPITATION
Line_852	WELL AS YOU SHAKE IT MOICING THE BAG THE PERSON'S HAND IT IS MAKING FORCIPITATE MORE
Line_853	THE CHEMICAL ACTION CURVED BECAUSE THE PROIPITATION HAPPENED AND IT WENT DOWN CHAIN
Line_854	THE MAGNET IS BRINGING THE PAPER CLIP RIVER TO
Line_855	THE MAGNET IS MOVING AROUND AND THE THE PAPER CLIP IS STAYING
Line_856	IT'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_857	MAGNETS
Line_858	WHEN I WENT UP TO NINETEEN IT STOPPED I WENT DOWN
Line_859	THE WHEN I WENT UP TO NINETEEN AGAIN THE THE MAGNETS WERE ATTRACTING AT FIRST BUT THEN IT STARTED REPELLING B
Line_860	IT GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE WASHERS THAT THE MAGNET
Line_861	IT GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER EACH TIME YOU ADD SOMETHING
Line_862	WHEN I ADDED THE WASHER IT GOT SEPARATE THE MAGNETS SEPARATED FROM E
Line_863	IT ON ADDING AND ADDING AND ADDING
Line_864	THE NORTH AND SOUTH N CAN BE TOGETHER AND SOUTH AND SOUTH THEN NORTH AND NORTH CAN
Line_865	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_866	WELL YOU S YOU PUT THE BATTERY TO THE PUT THE BATTERY
Line_867	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_868	THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_869	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND COMING BACK AROUND AND AROUND
Line_870	MOTOR IS MOVING IT'S A MAKE THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK AGAIN
Line_871	BECAUSE YOU NEED METAL TO TOUCH IT FOR ENERGY TO WORK FOR ANY OTHER ENERGY
Line_872	IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE THE ENERGY IS TRAPPED
Line_873	FOR THE SWITCH TA CLOSED
Line_874	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_875	FOR THE FOR THE SWITCHER TO TURN TO CLOSE D
Line_876	IT DOESN'T WORK I THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANY MORE
Line_877	THE SUNLIGHT IS MAKING IT'S LIKE A A CALCULATOR MAKING IT WORK BY THE SUN
Line_878	WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE MOTOR TO RUN IT'S TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN WORK
Line_879	FOR THE SUN LIKE TO SHINE ON THE THINGS
Line_880	OR THE OUGHT FOR THE SUN FOR THE MOTOR TO WORK SO YOU CAN WORK
Line_881	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE ITS WON'T WORK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_882	MY NO MEAN NO
Line_883	IT TURNS THE MOTOR ON
Line_884	IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUNLIGHT FOR THE ENERGY TO WORK OR THE MOTOR
Line_885	THE SUN MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_886	THAT'S NOT MOVING ANY MORE
Line_887	THEN ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR ANYMORE
Line_888	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE D CELL IS FROM THE WIRE
Line_889	THINK YOU A LOST
Line_890	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_891	WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IT'S ENERGY
Line_892	THE NAIL IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_893	UM I
Line_894	A CONDUCTOR MAKES ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_895	IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POICAL STICK
Line_896	MADE OF A IS PLASTIC SO
Line_897	THAT ELECTRICITY IS ENERGY
Line_898	UM BECAUSE CONDUCTING IS NOT A FLOWING
Line_899	IT'S NOT SPINNING STILL
Line_900	WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT THE PAPER CLIP THAT IS MAKING THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_901	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU U
Line_902	WE WERE WE'VE BEEN DOING MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS TO WORK AT THE SAME DIM
Line_903	BY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRODUCES LIGHT
Line_904	I SEE A CANDLE PRODUCING HEAT ENERGY
Line_905	IT GETS IT COMES WAX OFF WAX IT COMES OFF AND THE IT HAS TO HEAT FOR HEAT AND T
Line_906	ITS MAKES IT'S BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
Line_907	T THE WAX
Line_908	NO AND HOPE
Line_909	IT'S SOUNDED LIKE NOTHING
Line_910	YES SEE THE WAX MELTING AND THE FIRE BURNING
Line_911	IT CANS IT HAS A COLOR THAT WE CAN SEE
Line_912	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING
Line_913	IT PRODUCES A SOUND ENERGY
Line_914	YOU CAN HEAR A SOUND WHEN THE STICK IS BANGING ON THE RUM
Line_915	THE GIRL IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_916	K REPEAT THAT
Line_917	BY EATING THE HEALTHY SNACK LIKE AN APPLE ANUS OR GRE
Line_918	I SEE A FEW BOCKS A BRANCH CANDLE APPLES AND A CABINET
Line_919	IT'S THE NOT TO TURN TO FIRE
Line_920	T IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_921	IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_922	UM IT'S MAKING IT PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_923	DON'T KNOW
Line_924	CAUSE THE SOLAR PANEL CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE AND THE ONE THING W CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE TWO
Line_925	THAT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_926	ENERGY UH
Line_927	IMPORTANT BY MAKES STUFF IN THE S MOVE
Line_928	BUILDING CIRCUITS CARS UNAH I DON'T KNOW
Line_929	IT AS WELL HOW IS YOU TODAY
Line_930	I I'VE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_931	CIRCUIT IS ABOUT TURN STONE
Line_932	THEY BATTERIES MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_933	SO THEY CAN ALL LIGHT UP SO IT CAN MAKES ALL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_934	UM IT'S MAKING IT TIE UP BY THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN THE BATTERY
Line_935	UM THE D CELLS ARE GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB'S TO WORK
Line_936	THOSE ARE THE D CELLS THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_937	BUY MAKING THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_938	ST FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_939	BY CONNECTING TO THE M
Line_940	VE GOT THAT
Line_941	THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS IN THE M
Line_942	SAY WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE BATTERY AND THERE'S LIKE FIFTEEN OF THEM LIKE BULB'S
Line_943	UM THE T ALL MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTER
Line_944	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WO GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_945	UP BECAUSE THERE IS THE TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER OH NO
Line_946	UM THEY BOTH MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK TO CREATED ENERGY
Line_947	THAT THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_948	A ENERGY
Line_949	IT HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_950	THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING
Line_951	THE BATTERY IS MAKING TWO BULBS WORKS
Line_952	THE BULBS ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_953	AM IT'LL GET MORE BRIGHTER
Line_954	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_955	ELECTRICITY COMES FROM A BATTERY
Line_956	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY GOING AROUND AND AROUND I FROM THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_957	THE MINE OF THE IN THIS PICTURE IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_958	THAT'S THEY ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_959	THE BATTERIES MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORKS
Line_960	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SIDES
Line_961	IT'S FLOWING BY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_962	CUT THE ENERGY BY THE BLUE LIGHT BULBS AND THE WOOL THE WATERS
Line_963	I NOTICE A WEIGHT FULBS OR LIGHTEN UP AT THE WIRE
Line_964	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I FORGOT
Line_965	M WITH TWO BATTERIES IT CAN MAKE IT BRIGHTER
Line_966	YES
Line_967	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE MORE BRIGHTER S
Line_968	BY MAKES YOU LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_969	THE SECOND ONE
Line_970	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_971	NOT SO MUCH
Line_972	IT SHOWS THE LIGHT BUL
Line_973	IT HAS MAGNETS FORCES IN THEM
Line_974	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE ITS MAGNETISM
Line_975	BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL
Line_976	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAG MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_977	BECAUSE IT IS METAL IRON OR STEEL
Line_978	YES BECAUSE IT IS METAL I RICH TOLD YOU THAT
Line_979	I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_980	B BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE IRON IN THEM
Line_981	MORE M MORE METAL S STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_982	OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR OR FORCE FOR IT SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_983	SOME METALS FOR MAGNETS CAN STICKS SO IT CAN WORK
Line_984	A IRON
Line_985	IRON CAN STICK TO METAL BECAUSE IT HAS LOOSE MAGNETS IN THEM
Line_986	THE ONE THAT'S NOT ALUMINIUM BECAUSE THAT HAS MORE OR IN THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S METAL
Line_987	SO THE ROCKS THE RING AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL CAN'T STICK
Line_988	UH IT WON'T WORK IT HAS NO METAL OR IT IN IT
Line_989	THAT THE GREY ROCK DOESN'T STICK
Line_990	THAT IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO METAL IN IT OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_991	STICK CAUSE IT HAS ME IT'S METAL
Line_992	IT'S WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT SO LIKE LITTLE STUFF IN THE R
Line_993	BECAUSE THAT HAS METAL INSIDE IT
Line_994	I IRON METAL STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_995	ARE ABOUT STUFF THAT CAN STICK TO METAL AND STUFF THAT CAN'T STICK TO METAL
Line_996	ONE IS WIRE TWO WIRES A BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_997	THEY GIVE OUT ENERGY FOR STEEL
Line_998	SOURCED IS ANOTHER WAY FOR SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU YES
Line_999	UH WHAT THEY THEY DO IS THEY GIVE MORE ENERGY KIND OF
Line_1000	I THINK IT'S PAFFERY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LIKE A PATH BECAUSE IT'S SO LIKE THIN PAT IT'S THIN
Line_1001	LIGHT BULBS ARE SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU A LIGHT
Line_1002	THEY HELPS YOU SEE AND MANY PLACES
Line_1003	A RECEIVER IS ANOTHER WORD FOR A LIGHT BULB
Line_1004	THAT MEANS THAT HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER THEY THEY DID VERY GOOD AND THEN THEY MADE LIGHT
Line_1005	LITTLE TINY ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE IS ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1006	IT CAL DEPENDS
Line_1007	UM WHERE THERE IS A MINUS SIGN
Line_1008	WELL THERE IS RED ON THAT SIDE AND THERE IS A FLAT SIDE ON THAT SIDES
Line_1009	THAT THE BATTERY TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S DOING THE OPPOSE THINGY
Line_1010	NO IT IS THE MINUS SIGN IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE BATTERY YOU GAIN
Line_1011	I AM SORRY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1012	YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND MAKE LIGHT WITH THAT
Line_1013	IT WILL NOT CARRY ENERGY UNDER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1014	OKAY YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO MEAN I HOPE I SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1015	H LITTLE FLAG IS SURE MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT MEANS THE IT IS WORKING
Line_1016	IF THE FLAG IS MADE IT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1017	IT NEEDS ENERGY FOR IT TO RUN OR GASOLYN
Line_1018	THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1019	IT'S IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT TURNS
Line_1020	IT CHAINS ON ONE RULE CHERNS ON THE SWITCH
Line_1021	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1022	CAS SLOWLY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1023	IT'S THE FLAG COULDN'T MOVE
Line_1024	EL BECAUSE IF THE CO DAY IS BLOCKING THE SUN
Line_1025	IT'S COUNSTY THE FLAG STOPS
Line_1026	T IS MOVING AND WORKING
Line_1027	WHEN THE SUN GOES TO THE MOTOR IT STRIPES TO M
Line_1028	MEAGRAH A FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1029	BE CAUSE IT'S METAL AND METAL I THINK HAS ENERGY
Line_1030	WELL USUALLY WHAT MAKES A MOTOR WORK IS NOT NOTHING ELSE PRETTY MUCH I
Line_1031	A USUALLY A NAIL
Line_1032	NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENING INSIDE AND YEAH
Line_1033	USUALLY AN INSULATOR IS METAL AND THEN CONDUCTOR IS USUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
Line_1034	INSULATORS ARIURALLY NOT METAL YEAH
Line_1035	OK AND IT STAIRS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1036	THEY UM THEY DON'T PAR LIT
Line_1037	WELL CONDUCTORS TO HERE ARE UM SOMETHING METAL USUALLY
Line_1038	HI
Line_1039	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WICK AND ONE CIRCUITS
Line_1040	BECAUSE BOUT WITHOUT ENERGY WE COULDN'T BE MOVING
Line_1041	YOU LIFE THEY FUEL HEAT
Line_1042	THE SHEET IS PARBLY FLOWING AND GIVING A'S ENERGY
Line_1043	YES I HEAR PLAINS BURNING G
Line_1044	IT'S ON IT KIND OF LIKE A SHE'S DOWN
Line_1045	FIRE OR THE FLAME IS MADE SUCH SIDE
Line_1046	IT MAKES THE BIG THUMB
Line_1047	BECAUSE ENERGY IS USE LATER WHEN YOU MOVE
Line_1048	IT MAKES ALOUD SOUND AND YOU'RE WASTING YOU ENERGY
Line_1049	WE CAN HEAR A LOUD SOUND
Line_1050	THE GIRL IS USING HER ENERGY TO WALK
Line_1051	BY FOOD AND APPLES FROUISWETCHE BALLS
Line_1052	OTHER IT WOULD CAUSE A FLAME
Line_1053	YOU SEE KIND OF LIKE A GRAY THING LIKE A GRAY CLOUDS GOING UP
Line_1054	THE WIND
Line_1055	THEY GET ENERGY BY THE SAME THINGS
Line_1056	I THEY'RE THERE ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1057	IT WOULD CREATE IF YOU EXPLAINED
Line_1058	BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT AND ENERGY- THEY GET ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1059	YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH THE W
Line_1060	E EVEN TRYING TO LIGHT UP TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1061	A CIRCUIT WAY A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT HELPS MORE INSTEAD OF USING YOUR HANDS
Line_1062	IT HELPS LIGHT BULB A HELPS LIGHT BUL LIGHT UP
Line_1063	THAT THE SAME THING JUST TWISTED IT IT WOULD EASIER BECAUSE THE MATERIALS THE CIRCUIT HOLD
Line_1064	UH PASSWAY
Line_1065	THE BLUE DELTS ARE WITH ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_1066	WE THINK OF AS LITTLE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND YOU CAN OUT LIKE BE CAVE
Line_1067	WELL YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEY START TO MORE AND MORE
Line_1068	MAYBE MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO BE CERTAIN WEIGHT TO FOR IT TO LIGHT UP
Line_1069	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD HOW ARE DO
Line_1070	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH BATTERIES
Line_1071	THEY ARE ALL KINDS OF MAGNETS FIRST IT'S A DO MAGNET THEN IT'S A HORSE MAGNET AND THEN IT'S JUST A REGULAR MAGNET
Line_1072	WELL THEY CARRY ENERGY INSIDE OF IT AND STICK TO ANY THINK STEEL AND MET
Line_1073	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1074	YES BECAUSE THE WHOLE ENTIRE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL SO STEEL STICKS TO ANYTHING MAGNETIC
Line_1075	IT'S LIKE PROBABLY LIKE LITTLE TINY MAGNETS BECAUSE THE MAGNETS TICK TOGETHER
Line_1076	TH NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL THE OTHER ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL SO IT WON'T BE ABLE TO STICK
Line_1077	O I GOT SHOULD STICKS I NEVER KNEW THAT WELL I'D JUST LEARN SOMETHING KNEW TO DAY
Line_1078	UM STEEL THAT'S A SURE STEEL
Line_1079	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIGHT A LIGHTBULB
Line_1080	THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1081	WHEN THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BATTERY AND ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB THEY MAKE THE LIGHT BULB S LIGHT UP
Line_1082	THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE ENERGY THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB GO ON AND THE WIRES THAT HITS IT
Line_1083	IT HELPS ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S KINDA LIKE THE BATTERY FOR THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1084	IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE
Line_1085	THEY ARE A PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY WHICH IS THE SOURCE ENERGY SOURCE AND TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_1086	ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
Line_1087	THEY CARRY ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY SO THAT IT MAKES LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1088	THE LIGHT BULB HERE IS FOR THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY SO THAT IT WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1089	IN THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE FILAMENT AND THE FILAMENT UH HELPS IT LIGHT UP
Line_1090	IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY
Line_1091	WHEN IT GOES THIS I THINK THERE IS ELECTRICITY SO THEN WE CAN HAVE LIGHT
Line_1092	THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1093	THE NEGATIVE THE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1094	ITS COME TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES TOWARDS THE WIRE AND COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE BATTERY
Line_1095	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1096	THE ELEC- LITTLE ELECTRICITY BLUE DOTS ARE GOING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_1097	IT TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY STARTED FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1098	ITS GOES BACK THE WAY THAT IT STARTED
Line_1099	IT MIGHT GO FASTER OR THEY COULD BOTH GET THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT MIGHT LIGHT UP OR IT MIGHT NOT
Line_1100	WHEN THEY'RE ONES ON THE SIDE AND ONES ON THE BOTTOM IT WORKS BUT WHEN THE'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1101	THE MOTOR FLAT THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1102	IT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1103	IT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING IN IT THE ENERGY IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_1104	IT IS THE ENERGY AND IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CAR YOU MEANT THE BATTERY FOR THE CAR FOR IT TO WORK
Line_1105	IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE ONE SIDE WHERE IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHY I THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING
Line_1106	THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR STARTS WORKING SO THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING IT WON'T WORK
Line_1107	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING WHAT IS A LIKE CLOSED
Line_1108	A A SOLAR THING IS MAKES SOME THINGS WORK
Line_1109	IF THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEN THERE IS NO ENERGY COMING DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO MAKE THERE
Line_1110	IT WOULDN'T WORK WE WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TO DAY ALSO BUT IT WAS CLOUDY DAY SO IT DIDN'T WORKS IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK
Line_1111	IT MAKES THE SOLAR PANEL HAVE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR YOU SHOWED ME THIS BEFORE AND I CAN
Line_1112	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THEN ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1113	YOU TOO BY MARNIE
Line_1114	GOOD HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU MA MARNEY
Line_1115	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSTCONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_1116	I SEE THAT THE GENERATOR FLAG ISN'T MOVING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TURNED LIKE TO WERE IT IT WOULD BE ON
Line_1117	T MAKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS IT IT WORKS RIGHT
Line_1118	OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DON'T WORK
Line_1119	BYE MARNEY THANKS FOR THE TUOTORING BYE
Line_1120	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY
Line_1121	THIS IS A CANDLE AND IT'S LIKE THE WARMTH WHEN WE DID A HAND RUBBING
Line_1122	THE HEAT IS MAKING THE IT'S SO HOT IT MAKES THE WAX MELT IT'S LIKE A CAR WHEN YOU GO IT BURNS OFF THE GASSY
Line_1123	I LIKE WHEN I WENT BY IT OR LIKE CAN SEE IT'S LIKE HOP
Line_1124	THAT GAS OR THE WAX IS LIKE GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE HEAT IS LIKE MAKING IT SO HOT THAT THE THE WAX
Line_1125	M LIGHT
Line_1126	THERE WAS NO SOUND I THE THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AT ALL
Line_1127	A PERSON IS BANGING ON DRUMS
Line_1128	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE IS EATING FOOD SHE IS EATING AN OR
Line_1129	IT IS MAKING SOUND
Line_1130	I SEE WOOD UM FUEL MY GASES ALAINE I SEE A CANDLE AND THREE APPLES
Line_1131	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH LIKE THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1132	IT'S ALL CONNECTED D
Line_1133	AY WELL IN THE ELECTRICITY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1134	THE ONE WHAT'S I WON'T TO SAY
Line_1135	ONE THE CIRCUIT IS THE WHOLE THING CONNECTED IN THE PATHWAYS ARE THE WIRES
Line_1136	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE
Line_1137	E ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING IN THE LAKE
Line_1138	THE BLUE DOTS ARE S A LITTLE ENERGY AND ENERGY
Line_1139	OKAY I DID THAT MARNEY NO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TOO
Line_1140	USUALLY ONCE OR TWO OR MORE
Line_1141	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND WOULD
Line_1142	WHEN YOU TAKE A BATTERY AWAY IT'S THE LIGHT BULBS ARE AS BRIGHT
Line_1143	DID YOU HAVE ANY MORE
Line_1144	YOU UM THE ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS AREN'T BRIGHT AT ALL BUT ON THE TWO D CELL THE THE LIGHTS ARE REALLY REALLY GET
Line_1145	YES AND IT WA IT LIKE WHEN YOU ADD AN ANOTHER D CELL THE LIGHTS THE BULBS OR LIGHTS GOT VERY D
Line_1146	WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING SERIES CIRCUIT S
Line_1147	IT HAS LIKE IT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_1148	I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS NOT THE WIRES
Line_1149	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THOSE L
Line_1150	THE PATHWAY IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1151	THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH THE PATHWAYS AND IT MOVES LIKE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1152	AT THE PATHWAY OR THE WIRES OR BOTH THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
Line_1153	IN BLUE DOTS ARE THE LITTLE DATA ELECTRICITY
Line_1154	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING LIKE THROUGH THE LIKE LITTLE PIECES OF ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH ER ANYTHING
Line_1155	WE ILL HAVE TO ADD MORE COMPONENTS LIKE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE WIRES
Line_1156	IF WE HAD A MORE THAN ONE D CELL THE BULBS WILL LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1157	I I SEE THAT SOME OTHER TIME THE BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY IT'S DIFFERENT
Line_1158	WITH TWO D CELLS IT GOES A BRIGHTER BUT ONCE THE ONE LIGHT BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK
Line_1159	BECAUSE IT'S THEN BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THE POSIT
Line_1160	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1161	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY
Line_1163	I SEE TWO TWO BULBS AND ONE D CELL
Line_1164	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1165	THE LIGHTS WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT OR A LOT BRIGHT
Line_1166	I JUST TOLD YOU
Line_1167	M MAYBE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1168	REPEAT PLEAASE
Line_1169	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1170	THEY'RE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND WIRE
Line_1171	A D CELL BATTERY
Line_1172	THEY'RE ALL ABOUT UM HOW THEY THEY POWER EVERYTHING I DON'T I THINK
Line_1173	IT MEAN THAT IT POWERS MOSTLY EVERY THING
Line_1174	POWER ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SOURCE
Line_1175	LIGHT BULBS UM HELP LIGHT COME INTO THE ROUMTC
Line_1176	IT MEANS THAT IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROOM TO GET LIGHTER
Line_1177	IT'S GOING UP AND DOWN AND UNDER
Line_1178	THE BOTTOM ONE WHICH IS BRINGING THE POWER AGAIN THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_1179	HEY PRESENT THE POWER ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1180	I NOTICED IT SWITCHED AROUND SO IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW
Line_1181	IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT WAS GOING BEFORE
Line_1182	IT CHANGES WELL GOING THE OTHER WAY AROUND
Line_1183	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1184	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1185	I THINK IT WOULD GET ERRITOR TO BREAK THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK

Line_1257	WITH TWO BATTERIES AND ONE LIGHT BULB IT'LL NOT WORK BUT WITH TWO BATTERIES TWO LIGHT BULBS THE WELL WORK
Line_1258	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE IF YOU DO YOU'RE GOING TO DIVE
Line_1259	I I THINK NUMBER ONE WHICH IS ON THE TOP
Line_1260	I THINK A CIRCUIT NUMBER TWO AND HAS A CIRCUIT AND EVERYTHI
Line_1261	WE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND EVERY TH
Line_1262	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT THESE SLOWLY
Line_1263	THEN YOU DON'T HAVE A CIRCUIT A
Line_1264	A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1265	UM I WON'T NOW
Line_1266	AT CAR UM CAN RE SLOWLY OR CAN YOU SAY LIKE A CHIPMUNK
Line_1267	THEN YOU DON'T HAVE A FOUL CIRCUIT
Line_1268	W CAN YOU REPEAT THAT SLOWLY
Line_1269	UM I CAN NOT I DON'T KNOW
Line_1270	BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CORE
Line_1271	I TOLD YOU THE LIGHT BULB FILLING IS NOT LARGE
Line_1272	CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME MY KNOWING FRIENDS ANA WAS BUGGING A
Line_1273	WE ANNOY THAT MY NORINCANCIARNA WITH DAMN
Line_1274	MAKES A A THE LIGHT BULBS

Line_1278	BECAUSE THE FILLS MEANT LIKE
Line_1279	Y AND BESIDES CAN YOU PUT A PETE ANT GET ME A PIE
Line_1280	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGMECTISM
Line_1281	IF A SOUTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL STICK BUT IF SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL REPEL
Line_1282	I CAN'T CURIOUS GET TO LESSON E
Line_1283	IT'S METAL SO IT'S ATTRACTS A MAGNET
Line_1284	I NAIL IS STICKING TO A ONE SHAPED MAGN
Line_1285	IT STICKS BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MET
Line_1286	THE METAL DOESN'T ATTRACT TO THE LOCK BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
Line_1287	BECAUSE WOOD CAN ATTRACT TO A MAGNET BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_1288	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL HAS ONE NAIL HAS IRON AND METAL AND THE OTHER DOESN'T
Line_1289	IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_1290	I THINK IT'S HAS METAL OR STEEL OR IRON IN IT BECAUSE IT'S STICKING
Line_1291	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1292	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IRON METAL OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1293	BECAUSE HAS STEEL AN METAL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1294	I'M GOOD I HAN I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1295	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1296	A A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
Line_1297	THE D CELL IS IMPORTANT CAUSE THEN IT GIVES OF ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1298	IT MEANS LIKE A PATHWAY TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBS WITH THE ENERGY IN THE WIRES
Line_1299	I THINK TRAVELS MEANS LIKE GOES LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB SCENT OFF ELECTRICITY
Line_1300	THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY
Line_1301	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ABOUT LIGHT TO SEND LIGHT SO THEN YOU COULD SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IT'S NOT JUST TO BITCH BLACK PLACE
Line_1302	IT MEANS LIKE IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE WIRES
Line_1303	I SEE THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHTS AND GOING IN THE CIRCLES SO THEN THEY COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1304	IT IS FLOWING THE LEFT WAY LIKE IT GOES RIGHT AND THEN IT GOES DOWN AND THE IT GOES AROUND
Line_1305	HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_1306	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE WIRES I SEE HOW IN THE PICTURE I IS GOING THROUGH AND AND GOING OUT THAT'S OUR WORK
Line_1307	THE END OF THE D CELL WITH THE MINUS ONE
Line_1308	IS THROWING TOWARD THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1309	THE BUDS REPRESENTS THAT THE THE BUDS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_1310	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING I'M SORRY I DON'T NOTICE ANY TH
Line_1311	IT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY IT WAS GOING NOW IT'S GOING THE LEFT WAY NOT THE RID
Line_1312	IT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY IT HAS FLOWING
Line_1313	THE MINE'S
Line_1314	WHAT'S IT UP I DON'T SEE ANY ITS UP
Line_1315	Y I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HINTS ABOUT IT
Line_1316	UH D CELL TO MAKE IT WORK IF IF THERE WASN'T A D CELL THEN HOW WOULD THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1317	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING AND IT WON'T WORKS
Line_1318	I NOTICED THAT WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH THE FLAG STARTS TO MOVE AND THEN WHEN I CLICK IT AGAIN THEN IT STOPS MOVING
Line_1319	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR HAS WIRES UP TO AND THE WIRES HU UP TO THE SOLAR POWER
Line_1320	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN I IT MEANS THAT IT'S COLLECTING ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR POWER TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_1321	IT WON'T WORK AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN HOW WILL YOU MAKES THIS MOTOR WORK
Line_1322	THE F FLAG IS THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_1323	WHAT I NOTICE IS THE FLAG IS NOT MOVING
Line_1324	IF THE BODY IS MOVING THEN IT MEANS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER IT T
Line_1325	HUH OH HOW IS YOUR DAD
Line_1326	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1327	CAN YOU PLEASE ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1328	AN THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BY THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1329	UH ANYTHING THAT'S METAL CAN MAKE IT'S S MOTOR
Line_1330	I NOTICE THAT IF THE STICKS WOOD AND IT DOESN'T COLLECT ELECTRICITY AND THE MOTOR'S NOT RUNNING
Line_1331	IT'S HAVE PUNNOLES THE TE
Line_1332	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT CLUSTEON AGAIN
Line_1333	YOU- PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1334	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT I S KNOWING A LITTLE KATE RIGHT RIGHT NOW AROUND ANYTHING YOU STUFK AN SMACK SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1335	THE MOTOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTOR WAS IT DOESN'T RUN
Line_1336	PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1337	THEY ARE MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1338	WELL WE RIGHT NOW IF YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT TRY GOOD THING
Line_1339	THE BRASS RUIN THE PAPER CLIP THE HOLD ON THE M ROW
Line_1340	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1341	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1342	WE'VE BEEN DOING OR SEE WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1343	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FUELS
Line_1344	IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT
Line_1345	YOU I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING ON THE CANDLE BURN S
Line_1346	IF A CANDLE DIDN'T MAKE SOUND THEN IT WOULD MAKE LIKE UM NOISE A
Line_1347	I CAN SEE THAT THE FLAME IS MOVING BACK AND FORWARDS FORTH SLOWLY Y
Line_1348	I SEE THAT THERE IS A FUEL WOOD AND THE CANDLE AND HIS THREE APPLES
Line_1349	KINKING AROUND
Line_1350	ITS TURNED INTO SMOKE
Line_1351	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1352	THE MOTOR THE MOTOR'S WILL START SPINNING IN A CIRCLE R
Line_1353	WE TAKE THE L THE L
Line_1354	EN I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_1355	THEY BOTH COLLECT
Line_1356	AND COAL AND GAS WE MAKE OF FIRE
Line_1357	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1358	R REPEATED
Line_1359	I DO NOT COMPLICRY NO
Line_1360	AND WE PLEAASE
Line_1361	WE PEACHED POLES E
Line_1362	I THINK THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE LIGHT BULBS AND THEY IT WON'T BE THAT BRIGHT U
Line_1363	RA ROSE LEESE LEESE
Line_1364	IF YOU ADD ONE MORE UM MORE D CELLS THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER I
Line_1365	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1366	WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SINCE WE'VE BEEN DOING SOCIAL STUDIES NOT SCIENCE
Line_1367	WHAT I'VE OBSERVED ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT IS THAT THEY STICK TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1368	WHAT IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH SHAKING TO A MAGNET IS THAT A MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS IRON AND STEEL
Line_1369	WHAT'S IN THE METAL IS ITS LIKE TINY BITS OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT HELPS IT STICK
Line_1370	ER PACKED POLES
Line_1371	IT IS TRUE THAT PAPER CLIPS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1372	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1373	I'M GOOD SWAY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1374	WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS ACTION THE
Line_1375	I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE IT LEARN IT
Line_1376	THEY'RE FACING THE SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER AND THOSE NOTES ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO REPEL
Line_1377	THE SUMMARY BOTTOM IS THAT SOUTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THE TRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE FACING THEY'RE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO THEY ATTRACT
Line_1378	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1379	W WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS THAT TO LEARN ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_1380	H
Line_1381	WHAT MAKES ME SEE THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED IT WITH A MAGNET AND A PAPER CLIP AND THEN I HUH I PUKE IT UP TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WHICH IS LIKE ATTRACT
Line_1382	OKAY IT'S THE MAGNIC IS SENDING A LEAR MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO PICK UP THE STOOAY
Line_1383	WE PAPER PLEASE
Line_1384	EK THAT AS YOUR MOM IS PAYING YOUR PINS
Line_1385	REPEAT RE
Line_1386	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET SACS AND LEARNING AL
Line_1387	WHAT'S IT ABOUT IS THAT WE WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT A MAGNET WILL ATTRACT
Line_1388	WHAT MAKES ME SEEN THAT IS BECAUSE I TEST IT IT OUT
Line_1389	WHAT'S ABOUT THAT IS I A AND B
Line_1390	NOT REALLY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1391	SCIMBREANG WHEN FIRE
Line_1392	YOU HAVE THE S
Line_1393	REPLACED MIGHT BE ICIFTY
Line_1394	THE LADY WE DON'T KNOW WHEAT TO BE DONE
Line_1395	KI COLLECTED FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_1396	WE S THE BEADLE ONE
Line_1397	LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1398	A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1399	THEY POWER STUFF LIKE COMPUTERS AND A STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_1400	ITS STORES ENERGY AND THEN IT GIVES OTHER THINGS ENERGY TO USE
Line_1401	I DON'T KNOW DON'T
Line_1402	ELECTRICITY OR POWER
Line_1403	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT THEY RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES OR THE BATTERY
Line_1404	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1405	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE POSITIVE END
Line_1406	IT GOES TOWARDS THE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE N
Line_1407	IT GOES BACK TO WHAT IT WAS NORMALLY HAD THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS BACK TO THE SIDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO IN THE FEET
Line_1408	ITS IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE TOUCH
Line_1409	IT WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T F FLOW LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_1410	THE SIDES N THE SIDES WORK
Line_1411	WE'VE BEEN LODING LEARNING HOW A MOTOR WORK
Line_1412	BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS GETTING A POWER BY THE D CELL AND THE MOTOR IS POWERING THE FLAG
Line_1413	THAT THERE IS POWER IN THE MOTOR IT HAS ENERGY
Line_1414	THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D CELLS
Line_1415	IT MIX I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY I DON'T
Line_1416	ITS IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER SO THE FLAG CAN RUN
Line_1417	THIS IS UM MOTOR WITH A SWITCH A CIRCUIT WITH A SWI-
Line_1418	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_1419	BECAUSE THE SWITCH WASN'T TOUCHING THE WIRE E
Line_1420	IT STOPS BECAUSE IT CAN FLOW THROUGH THE PU TO THE POSITIVE S
Line_1421	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1422	WHEN IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE THE MOTOR SPINS WHEN IT'S NOT THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_1423	I I WAS ABSENT THAT DAY
Line_1424	THAT THE SUN IS THERE TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_1425	IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1426	THE THE FLAG STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1427	IT PRODUCES ENERGY SO THE STORE SOLAR PANEL CAN GET ENERGY FOR THE MOUNT
Line_1428	IT IS A CIRCUIT WITH THE MOTOR
Line_1429	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING OVER WHAT ELECTRICITY CAN F FLOW THROUGH
Line_1430	HOW ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SOMETHING BUT NOT OTHERS
Line_1431	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1432	THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1433	SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE LIST WORKS BUT OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE SPONGE AND THE ROCK S
Line_1434	THAT WITH UH STICKS THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_1435	IT IS OPENED
Line_1436	IT DIES IN IT STOPS SPLITTING
Line_1437	UH I COULDN'T MOVE MY INTUMS SO
Line_1438	THEY ARE METAL
Line_1439	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS ATTRACT AND REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1440	A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_1441	THEY'RE MAKING THE LIGHTS THE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
Line_1442	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_1443	T ISN'T JUST TWO WIRES IT'S FOR WIRES
Line_1444	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_1445	EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_1446	THEY'RE LIGHTING OUT REALLY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE I THINK THEY EACH HAS THEIR OWN WENT YOU PATHWAY
Line_1447	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1448	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1449	REPEAT THAT POLES
Line_1450	IT IS SHOWING THAT PATHWAY IT'S GOING
Line_1451	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS BUT ONE D CELL
Line_1452	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOP ARE BRIGHTER THAN LIGHT BULBS ON THE BOTTOM
Line_1453	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1454	NEED THEY NEEDED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_1455	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS LIT CONNECTED IT'S NOT
Line_1456	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT DOESN'T
Line_1457	YOU HAS TO REPLACE THE LIGHT BULB FOR D CELL
Line_1458	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WORKS BETTER THAN A NORMAL CIRCUIT CAUSE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATH
Line_1459	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY OF ENERGY
Line_1460	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_1461	YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1462	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND NOW THE THERE IS NO A PATHWAY
Line_1463	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
Line_1464	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1465	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1466	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1467	A SERIES I MEAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1468	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB KEEPS LIGHTING
Line_1469	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB STOLL KEEPS GIVING U
Line_1470	ONE FILL A BROKE BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS ARE STULL WORKING
Line_1471	THE FILAMENT IT BURNS OUT BUT THE LIGHT BULB THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS STILL
Line_1472	THEY ALL CONNECT TO THE D CELL
Line_1473	THERE IS A BURNT OUT FILLMENT
Line_1474	BECAUSE THE FILLS BROKE AND THERE IS NO OTHER PATHWAY TO GET THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1476	THE SIDES A NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1477	I LEARN THAT IN CLASS THAT IRON OR STEEL ATTRACTS MAGNETS
Line_1478	THE THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1479	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE RESRIGERAT
Line_1480	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET THE MA YEAH
Line_1481	THE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1482	S YES THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1483	WOOD DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1484	IRONS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_1485	THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF IT
Line_1486	THEY STICK TO STUFF THAT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1487	ONE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN
Line_1488	THE ONE THAT IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_1489	THE STUFF THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT STICKS BUT THE STUFF SEEDS THAT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1490	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN
Line_1491	IT STICKS
Line_1492	ULB IT MIGHT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT AND THAT'S WHAT
Line_1493	S SOME METALS HAVE IRON IN THEM OR STEEL AND THOSE WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1494	BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL AND SEA INSIDE OF
Line_1495	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1496	NORTH AND SOUTH NORTH AND SOUTH STICK TOGETHER BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1497	THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE MAGNET ARE STICKING
Line_1498	BECAUSE SIDES NORTH AND NORTH WE WELL BUT SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH A CHA
Line_1499	SIDES NORTH AND NORTH SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL BUT NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1500	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING OR SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ATTRACTING
Line_1501	A GIRLS HIKING NORTH
Line_1502	I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S POINTING NORTH
Line_1503	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACT BUT NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1504	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH THEY RE
Line_1505	TIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1506	THERE IS A MAGNET A MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUT THE TABLE IS STOPPING IT FROM GETTING ALL THE WAY THERE
Line_1507	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE TO REACH THE PAPER CLIP SO IT CAN'T MOVE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1508	THE MAGNET IS TRAVELING THE MAGNETITE OR THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLI
Line_1509	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING INTO THE NAIL AND IT'S MAKING IT ACT LIKE A MAG
Line_1510	THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL STICK LIKE A MAGNET SO THE PAPER CLICKS CAN STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_1511	THE MAGNET NEEDS TO BE REALLY STONGGED
Line_1512	AT THE TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_1513	BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORCE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRAVELS THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICKS UP THE PAPER
Line_1514	IT HELPS THE NAIL GET A MAGNETIC FORCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1515	UH THE NAIL WOULD LOSE IT'S FORCE
Line_1516	IT WON'T BECOME A MAGNET IF SO MAGNET ISN'T TOUCHING IT
Line_1517	THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET WHICH IS PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1518	IT'S BECOMING A TEMPORARY AR MAGNET
Line_1519	IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING IT AND THEN IT HAS A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1520	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1521	THE NAIL IS BECOMING A TEMPORARY TEMPORARALLY A MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1522	BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1523	IT'S SHOWING IF A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1524	THAT IF IT'S TOUCHING IF A MAGNET IS TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT THING CAN BECOME A TEMPORARY MEA
Line_1525	THE MAGNET IS GIVING THE PA THE NAIL MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1526	WE
Line_1527	IT'S CHECKING HOW MANY WASHERS IT CAN TAKE IN T THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS IS BROKEN UP
Line_1528	ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE IS TWO MAGNETS AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS A BUNCH OF WASHERS
Line_1529	WHEN I ADD MORE WASHERS THE THIN
Line_1530	TROUT IT BREAKS UP THE HORCE A LITTLE BIT
Line_1531	THE DISTANCE IS GOING
Line_1532	ITS BREAKS IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE
Line_1533	THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1534	THE FORCE IS STRONG ENOUGH SO EVEN ONE WASHER COULD BREAK UP THE WHOLE THE WHOLE FLORCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_1535	YOU PUT MORE SPACERS
Line_1536	THE MAGNETIC FORCE GETS IT GETS EASIER TO BREAK E EVERY TIME YOU ADD A SPACER
Line_1537	IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE A LITTLE
Line_1538	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1539	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACT SIDES NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH RE

Line_1541	GETTING THE ZIVIET TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET
Line_1542	YOU RAPID AROUND THE RIVET AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN
Line_1543	IT MAKES THE RIVER T BECOME A MAGNET
Line_1544	IT BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1545	WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S THE RIVET BECOMES A MAGNET BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT STOPS
Line_1546	IT STOPS BECOMING A MAGNET
Line_1547	THERE IS AN ELECTRONIC FORCE AROUND THE WRAPPED WIRE
Line_1548	YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_1549	YOU NEED A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1550	THE RIVITS BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1551	IT OPENS OR CLOSES THE B
Line_1552	IT HAS TO BE NEXT TO THE RIVET

Line_1566	HE IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVE THE ENERGY
Line_1567	N REFLECT AND IT MAKES LIGHT
Line_1568	THE TRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB IS TO POWER FILM
Line_1569	BE CAUSE THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1570	THE ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB GOING INTO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1571	ITTY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1572	THE ELECTRICITY F ROWS ITS STORED IN THE LIGPOLE AND IT ONE SOMETHING HITS IT IT GOES OUT OF IT AND
Line_1573	AT THE POSITIVE NO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1574	THE LOWER DOTS IN CLIP THIS PICTURE IS THE ENERGY FLOWING MAKE TRAVEL THROUGH IT THEN COME
Line_1575	FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1576	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENTS AS AND IT
Line_1577	IF FLIPPED AROUND THEN THE ENERGY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE OTHER END
Line_1578	IT UM THE LIGHT BULB GOES OFF THEN A TURNS AROUND THE ENERGY COMES OUT TO WHERE THE POSITIVE SIDE WILL
Line_1579	THE ENERGY FLOWS A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1580	IT IS FLYING BEHYIND THE IT'S FLOWING FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT'S FLOWING BACK INTO THE MINUS PU NO
Line_1581	IT'S THAT THE MINUS SIDE IS FLOWING OUT ENERGY TIN THE MINUS SIDE AND THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1582	THERE WILL BE NOT ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1583	I NOTICE THAT ON THE SIDE IF ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE BOTTOM IT'LL END THE ONE'S ON THE SIDE IT WILL LIGHT UP BUT IF THERE IS BOTH ON THE BOTTOM THEY W
Line_1584	WE UM WE'D JUST EXPERIMINENT WORKING MOTORS
Line_1585	MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS POWERING
Line_1586	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1587	IT MEANS THAT UM IT RECEIVES THE
Line_1588	ENERGY MUST FLOW WITH THREE WIRES TWO TWO THERE'S
Line_1589	BE UM IN THE MOTOR IT'S THERE IS A CIRCUIT ENERGY'S MOVING
Line_1590	ETTERY HAS ENERGY SO THE WIRE'S TAKING ENERGY AND
Line_1591	THERE'S A SWITCH THERE'S A SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND THE MOTORS
Line_1592	ITS TOUCH THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE BATTER THE METAL SO THAT'S WHERE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL THEY DON'T U
Line_1593	YEAH I THE WHOLE LATE IS TO S
Line_1594	SWITCH AN ON TURNED IT ON AND
Line_1595	TURNS IT TURNS TO VAN THE MOTOR UM
Line_1596	IT'S ENERGY FLOWE WE STOP AND RETREAT
Line_1597	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ONTO THE
Line_1598	NOT USE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE METAL IT'S TRAIN WHEN YOU TAKE IT AL
Line_1599	IT'S IN THEY A CLOSED

Line_1601	THE PANEL IS LIKE UM IT'S A RECEIVER BUT IT'S LIKE A BATTE
Line_1602	EVER AND A BATTERY AT THE SAME TIME ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO POWER THE
Line_1603	THE FOR THE SOLAR POUND TO RUN TO MAKE ENERGY THE SUN HAS TO BE OUT
Line_1604	THE SILENCE CANNOT LIKE ENERGY SWITCH THAT BUT THE ENERGY COMES DOWN AND IT HITS THE SOLAR PUT
Line_1605	ITS DIC OR CELL WOULD STOP ROWNING
Line_1606	WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN UM IT DOESN'T CO IT THE MOTOR ST
Line_1607	THEY'RE GROWING AND WHEN IT'S DARK OUT THE MORE STOPS WORD
Line_1608	IT STARTS WORKING IT STOPS WHEN
Line_1609	THE MURDOR'S THE MOTOR STICK RUN
Line_1610	BEFORE IT DOESN'T HIT THE BATTERY THE SOIL PANEL ABOUT IT HITS THE WHAT YOU CALL IT
Line_1611	IS OUR THE MOTORS YOU'VE
Line_1612	AND THE CENEAL WAS MELTING
Line_1613	FIRE IS LIKE THE FILM
Line_1614	IT GIVES OF HEAT AND IT
Line_1615	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU NEED ENERGY TO POWER EVERYTHING ON YOUR HOUSE
Line_1616	UH THE ENERGY IS LIKE A FLU STEEL OR THE
Line_1617	HU HUH HUH HU
Line_1618	FOUL L
Line_1619	IT IS NO JEAN
Line_1620	THERE WAS NO SOUND IT
Line_1621	IT IS BURNING ON FIRE AND IT'S GOING A MOUNT AND FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
Line_1622	THERE IS SOUNDED ENERGY
Line_1623	SHE IS EN AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALKING
Line_1624	I I CAN HEAR A SOUND
Line_1625	I SEE A APPLES A CANDLE WOOD AND A FUEL CAN
Line_1626	D
Line_1627	AT AN APPLE
Line_1628	BECAUSE THEY POINTED BOTH DO ENERGY
Line_1629	TINURYPEAA BECAUSE DILE WAS TALKING
Line_1630	BECAUSE THE GAS COAL BURN AND THEY MAKE FIRE
Line_1631	AND THE SOLAR AND THE WIND MEAL DON'T THEY PRODUCE IT
Line_1632	IT WILL POLLUTE DEE
Line_1633	HOW'RE YOU MARIED
Line_1634	UM IT WAS PRO YOU MARRIED
Line_1635	BECAUSE NAILS ENERGY AND ARE YOU MARRIED
Line_1636	MARNEY ARE YOU MIRROR TO SOMEONE ON MY SCHOOL
Line_1637	OH MARINE I DA I JUST HAD TO TWIST
Line_1638	IT IS IT FELT A CURRENT OF ENERGY AN A CIRCUIT
Line_1639	ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE L
Line_1640	ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1641	DON'T KNOW
Line_1642	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1643	ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THIS THE ONE ON THE WIRES TAKES THE ENERGY GOES TO THE LITER AND THEN IT FLOWS YOU THERE VEIN COMES TO THE OTHER ONE
Line_1644	THAT IS THE ENERGY
Line_1645	IT HAS TO BE FLOWE THROUGH MANY TWO RECEIVERS
Line_1646	MOTRABLE END KINDS OF ENERGY FLOW SO THERE COMES OUT TWO LIGHT BULBS ONE LIGHT BULB GET ANOTHER D THEN COME BACK
Line_1647	THREE THREE THIRTY A
Line_1648	YOU NEED MORE POWER SOURCES
Line_1649	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GAINED
Line_1650	THAT THEY GET DIMMER
Line_1651	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_1652	IT GIVES IT MORE ENERGY
Line_1653	UM IF IT ONCE IT THEN BOTH MMM GOES OUT ONE OF THEM GOES OUT YOU HAVE TO REPLACE ANOTHER ONE
Line_1654	BECAUSE THE THEN PLUS PUSH ARE TOUCHING TOGETHER AND
Line_1655	UM WHEN YOU TURN ONE OF THE D CELLS AROUND IT WILL START WORKING AGAIN
Line_1656	IF OF TWO OF THE SAME SIDES TOGETHER IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1657	DON'T PUT TWO BATTERIES TOGETHER ON THE SAME SIDE
Line_1658	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT REALLY BRIGHT
Line_1659	UM THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT HAS ONE BATTERY BUT OR WIRES
Line_1660	OH I DON'T KNOW
Line_1661	EACH OTHER THEY EACH UH THE ROAD PATHWAY
Line_1662	AWAY THE PORES FOLWARD
Line_1663	IT IT'S CARRYING FOR THE NECTIVE TWO THE TWO LIGHT BULB
Line_1664	I SEE I SEE IT'S GOING NOISE
Line_1665	THAT IS YE
Line_1666	IT FLOWS WHEN A STONE FLOWING THROUGH THE OTHER ONES IT IT FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1667	UHM OBSERVING GOES FROM LUNCH TO THE
Line_1668	IT IS BURNING NOW IT'S NOT BURNING AS IT AN IT'S BURNING RUDELY QUICK
Line_1669	THERE IS TWO PALLASORCES
Line_1670	M IT'S SHARING THE SAME POWER SOURCE IT NO NEVER M
Line_1671	THERE'S SHARING THE SAME FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_1672	YES THERE IS TWO BUT THE GIVE IT MORE ENERGY SO THAT'S WHY YOU BRIGHT
Line_1673	T THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1674	AELE CIRCUIT AND THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1675	THE TOP RIGHT PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1676	BE CAUSE EXPERIMENT WITH AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1677	THERE IS A BAR MAGNET DON'T A MAGNET AND HURT
Line_1678	MAGNET MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO IRON OR STEEL OR
Line_1679	MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO ANYTHING MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1680	MAYBE CANNARY IF YOU DON'T
Line_1681	STICKING CUP AL FRIGURATOR
Line_1682	THE RETIGURATOR IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1683	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL AND I DON'T AND MAGNET
Line_1684	RAINING REPEAT
Line_1685	CAN ATREPEATE THAT
Line_1686	WOOD A ALUMINIUM CHEESE
Line_1687	REASON THAT IS BECAUSE ONLY CERTAON IDOMS IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IR-
Line_1688	THE WOOD BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1689	UM THE STEEL IRON ANYTHING HATE THOSE TWO MATERIALS WILL STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1690	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL
Line_1691	ANICOCTURE
Line_1692	THAT THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING AND ALUMINAIL IS NOT BECAUSE THE STEEL IS MADE OF IRON AND THE ALUMINIUM IS NOT
Line_1693	DELUNIUM ALUNIMUM ALU ALUNIUM IS NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1694	BECAUSE NOT ALL METALS IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL BUT A STEEL NAIL IS ARE MADE OF IRON
Line_1695	IR AND THE STEEL NAIL
Line_1696	MU I DON'T KNOW
Line_1697	THE STEEL NAIL HAS IRON IN IT
Line_1698	THE STEEL NAY ARE STICKING TO THE M
Line_1699	TE BLACK ROCK STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT HAS IRON IN IT OVER
Line_1700	THE GREY ROCK W NOT WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO IRON
Line_1701	IT HAS STEEL IN IT
Line_1702	ITS HAS IRON AND STEEL IN IT
Line_1703	BECAUSE IT HAS STE
Line_1704	US STEEL
Line_1705	WE I THINK WE LEARN TODAY IT HAS TO STICK TO MAGNETS IT HAS TO BE MADE OF STEEL OR
Line_1706	HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB L
Line_1707	A BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHTBULB
Line_1708	THEY GIVE THE LIGHT BULB A ENERGY
Line_1709	IT'S THE SOURCE THAT GIVES THE MAPLE EN
Line_1710	IF THEY CONNECTED TO THE D CELL THEY TRANSFLL THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1711	THEY- THEY LIGHT UP IF IT HAS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1712	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE N IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1713	THE D CELL IS GIVING THE THE UH LIGHT BULB UM AND OF THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1714	THE THE TOWEL COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND COMES TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1715	IT GIVES IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1716	IT LIGHTS UP
Line_1717	IT MOVES THE POSIT WAY
Line_1718	THE NEGATIVE
Line_1719	BUT BOTH OF THE WIRE DOES ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THE S'S ONE WIRE GOING FROM THIS SIDE
Line_1720	IT WOULDN'T GIVE IT ANY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE COULDN'T BE ANY GOING OUT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_1721	THE LIGHT BULB NOW LIT UP WHEN I CHANGED IT TO AN SIDE
Line_1722	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING LEARNING ABOUT MOTALES AND WILES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTAL MO AND EVERYTHING
Line_1723	THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND MAKING THE MOTOR L MOVE
Line_1724	THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTAL IS WALKING AND IT'S MOVING
Line_1725	THE MOTOR IS WALKING
Line_1726	HOSE ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT
Line_1727	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_1728	THE IT'S THAT'S THE THE IT'S THAT'S IT'S OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S OFF
Line_1729	THE MOTUAL STOPS MOVING
Line_1730	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1731	IT'S IN THE CLOSED POSITION
Line_1732	THE ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTOR BECAUSE T NOT TRAVELING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1733	THEY UM THE SUN COMES IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON IT IT GIVES ELECTRICITY T TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1734	IT'S NOW AND THE SOL PANEL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR
Line_1735	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
Line_1736	THE SO PANEL'S UM GIVING IT ELECTRICITY CELL CAN MOVE
Line_1737	THAT IT TURNS THE SUN SHINED INTO ELECTRICITY AND GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1738	IF NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NO SUN ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO ELECTRICITY
Line_1739	THE MO TALE STARTS ON IN
Line_1740	IT GIVES THE SOLAR PANEL'S ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTAL SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTAL RUNS AND MOVE S
Line_1741	T DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY TO GET IT TO IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY
Line_1742	M MAKES THE MOTALE MOVE
Line_1743	BUT IT'S NOT GIVING ELECT ELECTRICITY TWO MORE
Line_1744	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTAL ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOAL MOVES
Line_1745	WE HAVE BEEN MORNING ABOUT SILIES CIRCUITS
Line_1746	THERE'S A CANDLE IN IT'S LIT AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GIVING OFF HEAT ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1747	THE WAX IS BURNING BECAUSE IT'S THE CANDLE IS GIVING OFF THE ENERGY FROM THE FIRE
Line_1748	AH ENERGY LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1749	LIGHT AND AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1750	NO YOU WON'T NO YOU DO NOT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THERE'S NO SOUND ENERGY TOO IT
Line_1751	GIVING OFF GIVING OFF LIGHT AND HEAT
Line_1752	THE A SOUND ENERGY AND DOES ALSO FOOD ENERGY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE FOOD ENERGY TO MAKE YOUR HANDS MOVE TO TO D
Line_1753	IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THAT SOUND IS SOUND ENERGY SOUND ENERGY
Line_1754	US ENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY
Line_1755	I SEE I I GUESS CAN I SEE WOOD I SEE APPLES I SEE MODEL AND I SEE A CANDLE
Line_1756	IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_1757	IT'S TEN INTO EXHAUST AND EXASTRAL POLLUTE THEY'LL
Line_1758	ONE IS ONE IS LIKE A LIQUID AND ONE IS JUST LIKE LIKE A BLOCK IT'S JUST SOLID
Line_1759	IT WILL POLLUTE TH
Line_1760	THE GAS AND COALS WILL POLLUTE THE AND THE SOL PANELS AND THE INTO BINES WON'T
Line_1761	A IT WOULD POLLUTE IT WOULD POLLUTE IT
Line_1762	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING CILLRIES CIRCUITS
Line_1763	THE D CELL IS GIVING PAREL FROM THE NEGATIVE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE IN TO THE WIRES TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1764	THAT ONE D CELL CAN BE USED TO POW MANY THINGS OUT AT ONE TIME
Line_1765	THAT THEY ALL ALL IN THE CIRCUIT AND THEY ALL DO ABOUT A UM AN THE CIRCUIT
Line_1766	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE D CELL AND THAT MOVES THE BILES TO WHATEVER IS HOOKED UP TO THE WIRES
Line_1767	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND BOTH THE LIGHT BULB S
Line_1768	THAT IT'S GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN COMING BACK IN TO THE D CELL
Line_1769	THAT REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FLOWING
Line_1770	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE BATTERIES TO MAKE THEM LIGHT USING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS TO MAKE THE LIGHT
Line_1771	FLOWS FROM IT FLOWS FROM A D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE FILM AND BACK TO
Line_1772	S ONE PATHWAY GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1773	TAKE MORE ENERGY FROM THE D CELLS
Line_1774	IT GETS IT GETS LESS LIGHT
Line_1775	BECAUSE ONE BATTERIES ARE LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS YEA SQUAT AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING SO YEAH
Line_1776	IT HAS ITS OWN PAP LAY
Line_1777	L WO THEY BOTH ALL USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1778	THEY BOTH RE THEY BOTH ARE USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1779	THE LIGHT BULBS BECOME BRIGHTLY
Line_1780	WELL THE BILLY CIRCUIT IT WOULD THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE DIM BUT IN A PILLPILLLE CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIGHT
Line_1781	THES SILLIES CIRCUITS AND PILL PILL WELL LEVEL IT'S
Line_1782	SOME HILL DONE HALFWAY OF ELECTRICITY AND SOME HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1783	WELL THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ENERGY AND THEY WON'T BE AS BRIGHT THAT WAY
Line_1784	WELL SOME SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY AND SOME DON'T BUT IF THEY SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY THEY WON'T BE AS BRIGHT
Line_1785	WELL THE FLOW THEY SHOW THE SAME FLOW SO THE LIGHT BULBS ON CAN BE AS LIGHT
Line_1786	THAT N SHOWING THE SAME FLOW
Line_1787	WELL IT'S SH IT'S HILING ENERGY FROM A LIGHT BULB FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1788	OR IT'S FLOWING IN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE M LIGHT BULB
Line_1789	WELL IT'S COMING OUT OF THE SIDE AND GOING BACK IN TO THE D CELL
Line_1790	WELL THE TOP ONES LIGHT THE BOTTOM UN IS NOT SO BRIGHT AND BUT LIKE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SHOWING A PATHWAY ELECTRICITY THE TOP ONES ON
Line_1791	THE TOP ONES ALL SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1792	WELL IT'S SHOWING THE SAME IT'S SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY SO THEY NOT GONNA GET AS MUCH AS ELECTRICITY INTO THEM
Line_1793	WELL UM THEY BOTH HAVE TWO BATTERIES NOW INSTEAD OF ONE AND THE PULL LIGHT
Line_1794	UM THE THE TOP TWO THE WOULD BE THE BEST
Line_1795	UP ONES BECAUSE THEM WERE BRIGHTLY SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE METAL
Line_1796	UM SO WE'RE DOING A TAPE UM AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1797	TRICITY IN A CIRCUIT UM HAS TO HAVE POWER SO CAN BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1798	A CIRCUIT HELPS UM TO HELPS DO ENERGY
Line_1799	IT ISN'T A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONNECTED BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_1800	US AND THE CITY BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1801	THIS CIRCUIT HAS A PATHWAY WITH THE WE
Line_1802	IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FLOALDS FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND INTO UM THEN IT COMES IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1803	IT'S FLYING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY
Line_1804	S UH THEY SENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IN A
Line_1805	THE I THINK THEY ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY LITTLE C
Line_1806	POSITIVE SIDES INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_1807	HE A POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1808	WHATA DID WE HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_1809	IS LESS ETRICITY
Line_1810	AT MORE THAN ONE D CELL IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTIL IT LO CLIPS BURNS OUT
Line_1811	BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1812	IT IT DOESN'T GO WITH A NEGATIVE FOR NEGATIVE AND IT GOES POSIT POSIT IT GOES NEGATIVE AND POSIT
Line_1813	THAT MAKES IT TURN OFF IS THAT THE BOTH D CELLS ARE THE POSITIVE AND THE POSIT THE NEGATIVE WITH THE NEGATIVE AND THAT'S MAKING IT TURN OFF
Line_1814	JUST FLIP THE BECAUSE IT'S SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1815	UM ENERGY COULD TRAVEL FROM MIRS
Line_1816	LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL ABOUT LIKE IT GIVES YOU LIGHT SO Y
Line_1817	WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE THAT I ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1818	A CIRCUIT IS ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING T THROUGH
Line_1819	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
Line_1820	THE BULB LIKES LEAD TO WE WE PICKED OUT AGAIN
Line_1821	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH CASING WIRE AND IN CASING WIRE
Line_1822	THERE IS EITHER THREE TWO OR ONES PATHWAY
Line_1823	WHEN WE ADD MORE PULPS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WICKER
Line_1824	IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT BECAUSE IT IS THE MICRO
Line_1825	UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIKE PORTION VARY IMGULAR IT'S LIKE TAKE THE LIGHT AND THE BURN IT OUT
Line_1826	WE HAVE NO MAH OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BAG S
Line_1827	I THINK THEY'D BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1828	PRODUCT DISCOVERY IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING A CO AND A LIGHT BULB BUT M SHINING VERY BRIGHT
Line_1829	I PLEASED THAT'S GO
Line_1830	NOT SO GREAT
Line_1831	WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE A DIFFICALD IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AND IT'S MIXED SO
Line_1832	THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARNEY IT'S BECAUSE THAT IS FINALLY RACING THE WIRE LIKE A SUPPOSED TO
Line_1833	WRAPPING THE WAY RIP AND THE FILLIMENTE WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND A
Line_1834	THE ELECTRIC THE T YOU CHEESE WE LED OUT A AND ALIVE
Line_1835	WE CIRCUITED A CICRAL LIGHT AND THE SERIES IS AT LEAST HAVE TO BE ONE WIRES CONNECTED
Line_1836	THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS CIRCUIT LEARSHES BY HAS AND GOING STOP STOP TING WHILE YOU HAVE ONE WIRE AND THEN THE WET ME
Line_1837	WE'RE HAVING TO THE ENERGY IS JUST ACTING TO DAY BECAUSE IT WAS NUMBERED THE ELECTRICITY INTO S
Line_1838	WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE IS NOT LIGHT
Line_1839	THEY ARE CONNECTED A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE
Line_1840	IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT A NICAL IT'LL LIGHT UP YEAH
Line_1841	WHY DO I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN ELECTRIC
Line_1842	E IS THE FILAMENTORY GROUP AND YOU FINS OUT
Line_1843	WELL A THE ELECTRICITY AND THAT ONE AT THE CIRCUIT BURNS IT OUT UM IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1844	WHAT IT'S BEING SHALL IS THE R PLACE BATTERY WITH A DIFFERENT KNEW ONES
Line_1845	MATH AND I NOTICE THE POLAR ONE OF THE RIGHTERS BEING WIRE THE VILLANIA IS ON CALONA
Line_1846	BUT I NOTICE THAT Y ONE LIGHT BULB IS GOING TO THE OTHER PRINT OUT AND RING AT ALL
Line_1847	T LI H BRAKES FICANT T JUST RE
Line_1848	THEY ARE CONNECT AND ARE REAL PENCIL OR THE WOMAN DID IT WE CAN MAKE UP TWO
Line_1849	ONE AND I YEAH I DO ARE TOGETHER IN FRANCE
Line_1850	I A YOU AND MIX
Line_1851	THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICITY OF FLOW STOPS GOING IS BECAUSE THE THE LIGHT B BURNS OUT
Line_1852	IN SIDE
Line_1853	THE MAGNETISM
Line_1854	MAGNETS TO USE MAGNETISM'S
Line_1855	H IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
Line_1856	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO METAL
Line_1857	THAT IS CALLED M MAGNETISM
Line_1858	IT HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF METALS IN IT
Line_1859	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS MAGNETS STICKING TO A AN NEIL
Line_1860	IT IS STICKING BECAUSE IT'S CERTAIN KIND OF METAL
Line_1861	THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT
Line_1862	THE PAPER CLIP TRY AND BECAUSE THAT'S A
Line_1863	ONE IS STEAL ANYONE THE OTHER ONE IS IRON I GUESS
Line_1864	THE PAPER FER STAYS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK R
Line_1865	IF I TRYING TO GET THAT TO STICK IT WILL SAY ON
Line_1866	IT CONNECTED AND IT STAYED
Line_1867	BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN METAL IN IT
Line_1868	IT MAY HAVE THE SAME THING AS THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_1869	ARE IN VEINORATY ABOUT MAGNETISMS
Line_1870	I THINK IT WOULD NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME CLODREN
Line_1871	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM IS NOT LET IT STICK TOGETHER
Line_1872	I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN PART OF IT
Line_1873	IF IT'S AN A CONNECTS IF IT'S EST US IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S NOT IT DOES IT EITHER
Line_1874	WHAT IS SIMILAR IS THE SIDE CONNECT
Line_1875	WELL ECINENE ATTRACT ENDINIS ATTRACT AND AND ASORNI DAN
Line_1876	WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS DOESN'T WANT LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME QUODRET AND THAT'S THE OPST
Line_1877	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUARTS IN THE EARTH
Line_1878	I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT TH SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER WAY AGAINST NORTH OR SOUTH
Line_1879	ACTION I IF YOU PUT A MAGNET UNDER IT AND YOU SPIN IT AT THE POINTY THING WE'LL KEEP SPINNING AND SPINNING
Line_1880	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC
Line_1881	PUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AND WHY THEY PUSH BACK
Line_1882	IT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND A PAPER CLIPS
Line_1883	THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1884	INCE THE MAGNET DROP WELL UNDER THIS TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONDUCTING IT AND HOLDING IT
Line_1885	THE FORCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKES IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
Line_1886	UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD PAPERCLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
Line_1887	NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONES LIKE WHEN IT'S ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THE MAGNET COULD HOLD THE PAPER C
Line_1888	IT'S BECAUSE THEIR MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH BUNCH OF PAPER SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH GRAM PAPER CLIP THAT'S A
Line_1889	WHAT IS GOING ON THE THICK PIECE OF PAPER IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK IT AND THEN THEN NICE BEGINS IT SO W
Line_1890	WHAT A'S BOY ALONG S E NO IS ARI TO PICK THE CUPS IN THAT AIR
Line_1891	OR LIT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THAT CIGNET THINGS TO
Line_1892	THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THERE'S THE NAIL USES ITS MAGNET
Line_1893	WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT AS IT'S ANY TIME MAGNETS ON IT IT REACTS LIKE
Line_1894	GOING ON WHERE I JUST SEE THE SAME THING YOU MEASURING YOU- LAST TIME
Line_1895	WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
Line_1896	MORE SCORING LOVIY BECAUSE I LIKE E AS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN NAIL ON THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1897	I SEE IS A MAGNET AND THE NAIL AND IT'S FIRST SKIP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
Line_1898	WHEN IT'S TO MAKE IT ON IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN IT'S NOT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1899	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETISM CREISSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAKING IT JUST
Line_1900	IT CAN BECAUSE THE THE MAGNET FOR
Line_1901	I THINK IT IS TRYING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_1902	MORTAR IS IT'S STUCK IN TO A NAIL AND IT'S CONNECTED TOPERIT
Line_1903	THE MAGNET IS THE PAPER PAPER CLIP IS ON TOP AND IT BLOWS ARROW
Line_1904	THE FORCE TO PREVENT THE STRONG ENOUGH
Line_1905	ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
Line_1906	WOULD IT PER AN IS LIKE A TEACITY THE WASHERS GO IN
Line_1907	AS I'M TRYING WHEN I GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE THE ALL
Line_1908	WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IF OR WHEN I PUT SPACERS WHEN I ADD THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1909	THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SEE THE MAGNETISM OF THE FOUND ALL IS FORCED ENOUGH
Line_1910	WHAT IT DOES MIXES THE MOON MAKES THE AMOUNT TOLLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
Line_1911	IT IS SPREADING A WATER
Line_1912	WHEN THEY DESCENDS IT ONE WASHED IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
Line_1913	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS MEASURED US SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WON'T CAN
Line_1914	BUT IT DOESN'T MIX THE FIRST A WEAKER
Line_1915	THE FORCE THE SPACERS MADE T FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
Line_1916	UH THAT THAT ONE SPEACY ER N NO WASHERS TO BREAK IT
Line_1917	UM BY A FORCE
Line_1918	I NEEDED THREES
Line_1919	BECAUSE BIGGER THAN THEN IT GOES SMALLER
Line_1920	BUT IT DOES MIX THE PRESS CAN WE CAN WE CARE WE'RE CONSERVING STRIKE AND USUALLY THE S
Line_1921	SIDED
Line_1922	I TELL ABOUT A CIRCUIT AND
Line_1923	THE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY IT CAN UP THROUGH
Line_1924	WHAT'S A PRINCE THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK CAN GO THROUGH THE FROM BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET RIP TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_1925	THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1926	IT ACTS A MAGNET AND COLLECT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S HIRST
Line_1927	WHAT HAPPENS IS TO SO THE ENERGY IT GOES T
Line_1928	THAT RELATES THE SITURS
Line_1929	WE LEARNED ABOUT A CIRCUIT AND UM CLOSER QUITE AFFECTED AND I DON'T WEIGHT
Line_1930	THERE'S WIND IT'S ENOUGH IN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS AM CONNECT THE WASHERS BECAUSE HAS NO COMPEL IT TO THE WIRES
Line_1931	ROLE ELECTRAL MAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS S
Line_1932	A CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
Line_1933	H IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1934	MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE'S ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MIX TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FOURS
Line_1935	E THERE HAVE BEEN THE RIVER IN THE WIRES IT HAS TO AT LEAST CONNECT OR AT LEAST DO SOMETHING D
Line_1936	THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET
Line_1937	WHAT THE PRINT IS THERE IS AN EX BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT HAS TO BE A A CLOSE CIRCUIT EVERYTHING
Line_1938	WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S IN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
Line_1939	ACCOMPLISHED BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE R
Line_1940	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS OR
Line_1941	WHAT I A DISCOVER WHEN I PUT THE RAPPING ONE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE WASHERS STICK TO IT
Line_1942	WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THE LIGHT IT HAS MORE THAT IS UP OR
Line_1943	THE MORE UM WINDS YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPEN TO THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORSE INTO IT
Line_1944	TUTOR RELATES
Line_1945	WHEN YOU INCREASE THE MORE BATTERIES LIKE LIKE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND ON YOUR INS IT PICKED UP THE WASHES CATS TO BATTERY
Line_1946	HAT'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
Line_1947	WHEN I MINE THE LINE TO SEVEN UM ARE TEN ONS I AVEN'T S BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP FIVE
Line_1948	WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR ELECTROMAGNET ROMANS ADMORE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_1949	THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE REVERSE WHEN D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES IT ER GOES UP TO
Line_1950	BUT I SEE ON THE MEDDLEGRAFF IS NUMBERS
Line_1951	THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BULB CONCERNS TO THE HUMAN A
Line_1952	BY HOW THE DIFFERENT HREFLECTIONS AT ARE THE WERE THE ABULBS TO SEE THE SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1953	UH THEY SOMETIMES GET HURT VIOU I
Line_1954	THE BAG HE FLIPPED A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
Line_1955	BY THE REFLECTIVEL HOW IT REACTS
Line_1956	LIKE A M IT SOMETIMES REFLECTING GO INTO THE CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_1957	WHAT I KNOW IS THE UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOKIS AT ONE SPOT
Line_1958	THE Y IT IS YOU PUT SOMETHING ON THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CAS
Line_1959	TAKE THEY PANE OFF AND REFLECT UH TO OTHER STUFF
Line_1960	IT BOUNCES OFF AND REFLECTS THE MINE'S THINK
Line_1961	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF THE MATTER WHICH GIVES HIM SO HE COULD SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
Line_1962	SHE IS REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TO A METER AND THE MRA UN IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL
Line_1963	IT'LL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR RULERS
Line_1964	BOUNCES AS A COKAL IN WATER
Line_1965	THE REFLECTS
Line_1966	SOLAR CELLS AND CIRCUITS AND MATE IS
Line_1967	STAINING COLOR
Line_1968	GIVES OFF LIGHT GREEN AND OR INCH BUILT BECAUSE YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
Line_1969	IT'S A REFLECTION OFF THE LIGHT TWO PERSONS
Line_1970	ITCH IS THE PRESS TRAIN COLORS
Line_1971	WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
Line_1972	THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR
Line_1973	THE SEVEN IT LOOKS
Line_1974	THE LIGHT IS RIFCLIS AND A ALLULUM
Line_1975	TURNING INTO SOMETHING I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1976	THEY LIKE KEEPS ON FISHING OFF OF OBJECTS TO THE COLORS BLUE
Line_1977	I UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF A BLUE OR A CLEAR
Line_1978	THERE WAS A STRUCTURE OF THE LIGHT
Line_1979	IT THE CHANGES INTO A RULER
Line_1980	THE HARE CHANCE OR WELL YET THEN
Line_1981	SO LIKE THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE BUT THE L
Line_1982	IT'S BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO THE INSTEAD OF BLUE
Line_1983	IT WAS UM YEA I'VE GOING TO TALK YET I IN IT I THE SOME FILL THERE S LIKE TALE DECLIRED
Line_1984	WELL HOW TO REFLECT ON THE IT YEAH NO
Line_1985	THAT CHANGED THE SAME AS A FIL
Line_1986	YES THE REFLECTION IT'S THE COLORS
Line_1987	THE REFLECTRIISE TO MIXING COLOR
Line_1988	IT A DARK
Line_1989	UM IT'S NO USED TO THE COLOR BECAUSE IT SAYS LIME AND EXPEGREE NOT RED OR BLUE
Line_1990	BE CAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO
Line_1991	IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED PILE RED
Line_1992	A THE RED
Line_1993	I AM DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_1994	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS WITH A WIRES AND BATTERY
Line_1995	TWO GREEN WIRES ONE D CELL BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1996	BATTERIES ARE A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT STORES ELECTRICITY
Line_1997	WIRES MAKE A CIRCUIT A CLOSED
Line_1998	THE AN OPEN CIRCUIT INTO A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1999	THAT THEY CONDUCT SORT OF ELECTRICITY TO THE TO THE BATTERY
Line_2000	I THINK ELECTRICITY TRAVELS I
Line_2001	WIRES CARRY OPEN CIRCUITS
Line_2002	LIGHT BULBS OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_2003	IT LIGHT BULB FOR A D
Line_2004	I THINK IT MEANS TO FOR LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER THAT IT MEANS LITE RECEIVES ELECTRICITY TO LIGHT UP TO
Line_2005	THAT THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRE OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2006	I I SEE IS ELECTRICITY CAN
Line_2007	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE
Line_2008	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE MAGNETS
Line_2009	THE END OF THE BATTERY IS FLOWING TO THE CIRCUIT WIRE AND THEN
Line_2010	THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB GOING TOWARDS THE BATTERY D CELL BATTER
Line_2011	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_2012	THE D CELL BATTERY FLIPPED OVER
Line_2013	D SIDE FLOWN
Line_2014	THE ELECTRICITY'S COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB IN BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_2015	THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRE SO THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP INTO THE FIL
Line_2016	I I THINK THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT IF YOU TOUCH BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE FACE
Line_2017	THAT WHEN EVERY TIME THE THE WIRE TOUCHES THE CASING WIRE THE BULB LIGHTS AND WHEN BOTH OF THE WIRES TOUCH THE BASE IT DOESN'T MO
Line_2018	I'M LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT
Line_2019	THE FLAG IS SITTING AND THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2020	THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE
Line_2021	THE BATTERY GIVES THE MOTOR ENERGY AND MAKES THE MOTORS
Line_2022	IT HAS A SWITCH MAKING THE MOTOR STOP P
Line_2023	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BY THE W
Line_2024	IT CONNECTS TO THE WIRE AND MIXES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_2025	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_2026	THE MOTOR IS ON AND MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2027	THE CLOSE CIRCUIT BECOMES
Line_2028	THE SWITCH HAS TO TOUCH THE WIRES
Line_2029	THE MOTOR STOPS AND MOVE S
Line_2030	THE SWITCH IS IN AND NOT CLOSED
Line_2031	THE ELECTRICITY TASTIC FLOW TO WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN TO THE MOTOR
Line_2032	WHEN THEY GET SOLAR ENERGY THEY POWER S
Line_2033	SUN IS TRAVELING TO THE TO THE SOLAR PANEL INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2034	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKES IT SPIN
Line_2035	THE SOLAR PANEL IS RECEIVING SUNLIGHT
Line_2036	THE FLAG WOULD STOP SPIN
Line_2037	WHEN NIGHT CLICK ON THE SUN THE FLAG AREA SPINNING AGAIN
Line_2038	A THE SOLAR PANEL IS NOT RECEIVING EN ER AND ANY ENERGY AND IT STOPS IN THE MOTOR FROM SPAN
Line_2039	IT IS SHOWING ENERGY TRANSFERRING FROM THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2040	WE ARE DOING FINE PICTURES
Line_2041	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO BUILD PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2042	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2043	THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH A POWER BY ONE D CELL BATTERY
Line_2044	THERE IS A TWO PATHWAYS
Line_2045	THE LIGHT BULB WOULD GET BRIGHTER
Line_2046	YE THAT A
Line_2047	BECAUSE IT COMES ALL
Line_2048	DON'T GOOD DON'T GOOD GOOD U
Line_2049	AE
Line_2050	ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2051	I NOTICED THAT THERE IS TWO PATHWAY
Line_2052	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS GETTING IT'S GETTING
Line_2053	BY LITTLE GOOD BUS HAD TO PORCHNTHOOD AND TU A SLARIES A KIND OF GOOD
Line_2054	BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE LIGHT BULB HAS TO STOP AND GO AND IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_2055	THE WIRES HAVE TO KNOW ENERGY HAS TO TRAVEL LONGER THAN IT WILL SU
Line_2056	BATTERIES
Line_2057	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE TO DRAW THAN
Line_2058	I AM DOING F
Line_2059	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING TO SOLVE THE STRINGS OF LIGHT PROB
Line_2060	ITIACARTYSTREEN TO LIGHTS STREENGS OF LIGHT
Line_2061	THE BULB IS NOT LIGHTING BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN CIRCU
Line_2062	A WU SHAG OR MEAN
Line_2063	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OFF
Line_2064	THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT BLOWN ANYMORE
Line_2065	BECAUSE IN THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE MORE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEY BOTH
Line_2066	AT
Line_2067	THE FIRST LIGHT BULB RIGHTS OUT AND THEN MORE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHERS
Line_2068	NO THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOW
Line_2069	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2070	THE OTHER BULB STANDS SLIGHT LIT BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IS CONNECTED TO TH
Line_2071	THE OTHER BULB STAYS LIT
Line_2072	WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE TURNS
Line_2073	BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AND WHEN THE OTHER BULB IT BURNS OUT THE OTHER BULB
Line_2074	AND LA AAA HARA BULB U UH
Line_2075	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON HELP MAGNETS IN TO WRACT WITH EACH OTHER
Line_2076	THE TWO BRICK MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2077	I THINK THE MAGNETS WOULD S REPEL INSTEAD OF ATTRACT
Line_2078	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_2079	OPPOSITE FLOWS AT TRACT AND AND MATCHING PARS DON'T
Line_2080	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS HAVE SOUTH SLIDE THE IRON THE IN TO THE
Line_2081	THE OPPOSITE PULSE
Line_2082	THE COMPECENT F IS SWITCHING NORMAL AND THE OTHER SIDE IS ON
Line_2083	H I AM DOING FINE THINK
Line_2084	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND HOW THEY WORKS
Line_2085	MAGNETIC FIELD IS SOMETHING THAT'S INVISIBLE AND A CAR
Line_2086	MAGNETISM WORKS BY THE LE FOR A AND OR THE WORE SAT
Line_2087	THE MAGNET IS IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_2088	THE MAGNET ONLY GOES THROUGH THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND NOT THROUGH THE STEEL
Line_2089	NO IT I DON'T NO
Line_2090	THE MAGNET IS INTERACTIC WITH THE NAIL IS ALLOWING THE PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NA
Line_2091	THE MAGNET IS INTERACTING WITH THE NAIL ALLOWING MAGNETISM TO RUN THROUGH THE NAIL AND STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2092	IT BECAUSE
Line_2093	MAG THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T RUN THROUGH THE NAIL AND
Line_2094	PROBABLY A FEW SECONDS
Line_2095	THE NAIL IS GETTING MAGNETS OR LETTING CLIP STICK TO IT
Line_2096	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCES REMOVE THROUGH THE NAIL AND THE PAPER COULDN'T FALL
Line_2097	IT'S SHOWING ME HOW THE MAGNETISM RUNS TO THE NAILS
Line_2098	WE ARE TWO D
Line_2099	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2100	YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT DOWN THE S
Line_2101	U IT ALSO WORKS BY UP AND AROUND THEM
Line_2102	THE RIVET IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE SWITCH IS ON MAKING IT A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO IT IS AN ELECTROMAG
Line_2103	THE WIRES IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2104	ONE YOU THROW A
Line_2105	IT THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE RIVET AND IS
Line_2106	I DON'T I DON'T CHEW COLD WE'RE DIFFERENT I MARRY YOU ALL BIG
Line_2107	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE AND GOES INTO THE RIVET
Line_2108	THE THE RIVET IS GETTING THAT IT'S ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY AND IT'S C
Line_2109	THE IT BECOMES MAGNETIZED ADVAGES UP THE WATER
Line_2110	WHEN IT CUTS LITTLE BIN
Line_2111	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW WE TRAVEL
Line_2112	THE LIGHT BULB IS TURNING ON AND THE BOY'S
Line_2113	THE IT REFLECTS THE LIGHT AND
Line_2114	LIGHT TRAVEL A DIFFACALTY AND HOW HOW FAR IT'S OUT GO
Line_2115	IT COUNTS AS OF TEN AND IT GOES THROUGH
Line_2116	THE LIGHT BOUNCES OFF THE OBJEC
Line_2117	IT PAUSES OFF THE U
Line_2118	THE UGLY BOY IS SEEING THIS REFLECTION
Line_2119	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE BAR AND THERE IS REFLECTING IT
Line_2120	REFLECTION MAKES THE THE LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH THE MIRRORS AND THEN IT EATS THE STAR IN THE LIGHT
Line_2121	THE LIKE GETS REFLECTED OFF THE MEIR AND THE MIRE MIXED THE LIGHT
Line_2122	THEN THE REFLECTION OF THE PENCIL IS GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENCILS
Line_2123	THE WATER REFLECTS THE PENCIL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO THAT
Line_2124	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REFLECTION AND HOW THE LIGHT THAT'S STALE METER'S
Line_2125	I AM COLD AND WEAK TODAY I THINK YOU FOR ASKING MARNEY
Line_2126	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS AND HOW THEY
Line_2127	THEY ALL
Line_2128	THE LIGHT IS SHINING TO DIRECTION
Line_2129	I I AM WEAK AND SICK THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNEY
Line_2130	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS HOW
Line_2131	UH I'M COLD AND WE THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNIE
Line_2132	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COLORS
Line_2133	THE LINT IS ALL YELLOW AND IS MAKING ENERGY OUT OF IT
Line_2134	THE LIGHT LIKE CAN COME FROM THE SUN NO
Line_2135	I CAN SEE THREE SOURCES OF WUHIGHT LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2136	A THE LIGHT IS SHINING INTO THE PRISM AND THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE LIGHT THE WEIGHT LIGHT INTO ITS C
Line_2137	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE RIGHT LIGHT INTO IT'S DIFFERENT COL
Line_2138	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE WHIGHT LIGHT INTO ITS ORIGINAL COLOR S
Line_2139	IN THE PRISM AND THE PRISM SEPARATES THE COLORS AND ER
Line_2140	I SEE ALL EVEN COLORS OF THE RAIN
Line_2141	IT MAKES IT AVERAGE COLORS ON THE
Line_2142	I THINK THERE ARE SEVEN COLORS OF
Line_2143	THE WHIGHT LIFE IS GETTING ABSORBED TO THE WHIGHT PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE WHIGHT LETTER IS REFLECTING OFF IT
Line_2144	BECAUSE IT FLOWS OUT
Line_2145	THE WEIGHT LIGHT GETS TURNED INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE WEIGHT PART OF THE BULB GETS ABSORBED
Line_2146	THE WHITE LIGHT IT'S GETTING ABSORBED BY THE WHITE PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE BLUE PART OF THE BULB IS GETTING WITH F
Line_2147	GOOD THE POSSUM BENEATH GETS THE BOSS
Line_2148	THE WEIGHT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE AND THEN IT MAKES THE BULB BLUE AND THE WHIT POT STICK WHIT
Line_2149	THE RIGHT LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE YELLOW BULB AND IS MAKING A BULL YELL
Line_2150	BULLS ARE BORN TO PLAY WITH AND THE BULL IS MAKING IT YELLOW BECAUSE THE WHAT IS PRACING ON IT
Line_2151	BULL MAKES YELLOW AND THEN BULL MAKES IT WEIGHT BECAUSE A WHITE SPOT AND YELLOW
Line_2152	THE PLATFORM IS TURNING ON TO BED AND BREAD IS TURNING CA
Line_2153	THE BOWL TURNS GREEN
Line_2154	THE BULCHERED GREEN BECAUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT MAKES THE BLUE FILTER INTO BLUE LIGHT IN THE YELLOW BULB
Line_2155	ONLY THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE THE LIME T
Line_2156	THE LIGHT ISN'T REFLECTING OFF IT AND THE LIGHT IS TURN
Line_2157	WHEN YOU SHINE THE LIGHT ON THE BRICKS IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2158	YOU WOULD SHINE THE RED LIGHT OR THE
Line_2159	I WE CALLED THEM A D CELL BATTERY A BATTERY AND A ENERGY WIRE
Line_2160	BATTERIES PRODUCE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS POWERS AND MOVE
Line_2161	THE WIRES AND A CIRCUIT TRAVEL ENERGY THROUGH THEM TO GIVE POWER TO AN OBJECT THAT IT IS TOUCH
Line_2162	IN A CIRCUIT WIRES CARRY ENERGY
Line_2163	SO THE BATTERY PA GETS ITS POWER AND IT LIGHT SO THE BATTERY IS LIKE A LIGHT S
Line_2164	A RECEIVER MEANS IT IS GETTING AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING FROM ANY THING
Line_2165	SO ME IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S TRAVELING TO THE LIGHT FROM BECAUSE OF A WIRE ELECTRICITY WIRES
Line_2166	THE NEGATIVE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2167	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ENERGY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2168	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2169	I NOTICED THAT THE ENERGY STARTED TO GO THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS LOCK WAYS
Line_2170	UH DIRECTION OF FLOW TURNS THE OTHER WAY
Line_2171	IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2172	I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS WORKING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_2173	I THINK THAT THE ENERGY WOULD GO JUST ON OVER AND IT WOULD STOP AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT
Line_2174	I NOTICED THAT AT FIRST THE BULB DID NOT LIGHT AND WHEN WE CLICKED THE BUT IN TH THE WITH THE WIRE MOVED THEN IT THE LIGHT BULB D
Line_2175	IN SCIENCE LATELY WE HAVE BEEN DOING CLOSED CIRCUITS AND OPEN CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORKS
Line_2176	IT'S IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THAT IT MEANS TO MOVE
Line_2177	IT MUST GET ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY SO THE MO
Line_2178	THAT IT MUST GET ENERGY SO IT W
Line_2179	THE BATTERY IS TRANSFERING ITS ENERGY AND THEN IT MOVES SO THAT
Line_2180	NOTICED THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER WIRES SO IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY JUST STOPS SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_2181	IS THAT THERE IS ENERGY TRAVELING FROM BOTH NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE LITER SWITCH HAS UP TO TICK E AND THERE A RULER
Line_2182	I NOTICED THAT I DON'T
Line_2183	IT HAS TO HAVE LIGHT FROM THE SUN SO THAT IT WILL MOVE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NOT LIGHT IT HAS NO ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR MO
Line_2184	FLU IS TURNING IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR PANEL NO SOLAR PANEL GETS IT'S ENERGIES FROM THE SUN AND THEN IT JUST LIKE MOST THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2185	I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS SAVING
Line_2186	THINK CAN IT CAN STILL PRODUCE ENERGY ON THE CLOUDY DAY I JUST THINK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS ON A BRIGHT AND SUNNY
Line_2187	THE FLAG WILL START TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR CELL AND THEN IT IT JUST MOVES AND IT DOES
Line_2188	MAKES THE FLAG ME WELL WELL WELL WELL
Line_2189	SE WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THAT THE FLAG WILL NOT MOVE
Line_2190	THAT THERE IS NO ENERGY TRAVELING FROM THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN UBUUBUULA
Line_2191	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCT THE INSULATORS AND THE IT'S LIKE FAT
Line_2192	HAVING CONDUCT THIS HELPS SEND ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR SO THEN IT CAN BUT TO S SPIN THE FLAG GROWN
Line_2193	INS THE CIRCUIT A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO POWER A MOTOR
Line_2194	CONDUCTORS ARE WELL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE OR CON NEGATIVE SIDE SO THEN IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER TO SPIN
Line_2195	GOD
Line_2196	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_2197	FOUND OUT THAT THE BRASS RING WORKS
Line_2198	ITS WITH AN INSULATOR IN IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THE AN INSULATOR WILL NOT LET ENERGY FLOW THROUGH OR TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_2199	THIS THE PAPER CLIP IS A CONDUCTOR AND ENERGY CAN IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_2200	CONDUCTORS ARE OBJECTS THAT ARE ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THEM WITH AND THE MOTOR WILL STILL SPIN IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER WIRE
Line_2201	WE HAVE SEEN ABOUT PRESENT ENERGY
Line_2202	BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO MAKE A STUFF
Line_2203	I DON'T KNOW WHAT FIELDS ARE
Line_2204	A CANDLE SITS ON FIRE AND IT RELATES TO ENERGY BECAUSE IT IS ENERGY
Line_2205	OBSERVED WHEN I SEE YOU CAN NOT BURN I FEEL
Line_2206	BURNING A CANDLE GIVES OFF ENERGY
Line_2207	NO I DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING ONE IS CANDLE BURN
Line_2208	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER BECAUSE IT IS FUELS AND IT IS GETTING USED
Line_2209	YOU CAN SEE HEAT OR YOU CAN FEEL HEAT
Line_2210	ENERGY IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEY ARE USING THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR BODY TO SET THE DRUM
Line_2211	SHE IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING ENERGY FROM HER APPLE AND THEN SHE IS USING HER ENERGY ON HER WAX
Line_2212	YES YOU CAN HEAR THE DRUMS BEING PLAYED BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INSTRUMENT AND THEY ARE MADE TO MAKE A NOISE
Line_2213	WE SEE A LAB OF SOURCES OF ENERGY
Line_2214	I SEE SOLAR PANELS APPLES BARKS TREE PIECES COAL AND FEW
Line_2215	THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BAD BECAUSE WE ARE RELEASING ADD GASSES INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2216	WE IT MAKES THE AIR U IT IT GIVES OFF BAD GASSES TO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2217	IT IS ALL DARK AND SMOKEY
Line_2218	I SEE DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES I SEE GOOD ONES AND BAD ONES
Line_2219	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT LEAVING BAD GASES IN THE AIR
Line_2220	THEY BOTH PRODUCE ENERGY AND THEY DO NOT AND NEITHER OF THEM PRODUCE BAD GASSES INTO THE O
Line_2221	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO LEAVE BAG GASSES IN THE AIR AND THEY THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES
Line_2222	I THINK THAT COAL AND GAS ONE DAY WILL RUN OUT AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE LEFT TO
Line_2223	THEY WILL HAVE BAD BAD AFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY POLLUTE BAD GASSES INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT A
Line_2224	UNRENEWABLE ENERGY CIRCHES ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ONE DAY THAT WE ONLY HAVE THEM NOW
Line_2225	I I AM DOING GOOD
Line_2226	WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUILDINGS SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2227	ELECTRIC ITTY CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_2228	TO THE BULB TO LIGHT THE THE WIRES ARE LETTING ENERGY FROM THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE GO INTO THE THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2229	IS TO GET ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LIGHT THE D CELL SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_2230	UM IT IS GIVING ENERGY TO TRAVELS LOAPATHWAY AND THE IT
Line_2231	UM YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_2232	IN A SERIES CIRCUIT PATHWAYS THERE CAN BE AS MANY AS TWO UP TO AS MANY AS A MILLION
Line_2233	AND MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULBS WHICH WILL GET DIM
Line_2234	OUR D CELLS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS GET LIGHTER AND THE WE BRIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY
Line_2235	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING A PARALLEL
Line_2236	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT B
Line_2237	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE D CELL BATTER
Line_2238	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS
Line_2239	I OBSERVED ENERGY IS MOVING
Line_2240	COMPARED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEN BRIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT
Line_2241	BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING MORE LIKE CHARTS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL YOU'LL GET MORE D
Line_2242	CON WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_2243	I REMEMBER THAT IT ALWAYS GOES LIKE IN ONE SIDE AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2244	IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PATH THE OR TWO PATHWAYS OR MORE IT MATTERS HOW MANY LIKE WELL
Line_2245	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLVING LIGHTS
Line_2246	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE STRING OF LIGHT
Line_2247	M TO USE UM YOU CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS MET
Line_2248	UM YOU CAN USE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WILL ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT THAT CAN COMPLETE THIS S
Line_2249	BECAUSE THE I THINK THAT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THAT LIKE LIGHT BULB SO IT DOESN'T KEEP FLOWING
Line_2250	THE LIGHT BULB THAT IS BROKEN AND THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2251	THE ENERGY STOPS RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE FILM A BROKE SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE
Line_2252	UNTIL THE FILAMENT BRAKES ON ONE OF EITHER OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2253	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2254	WE HAVE ALSO SAID UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL
Line_2255	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_2256	UM ONLY AT NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE WILL STICK TOGETHER
Line_2257	I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRID
Line_2258	THE NAIL A THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE THE NAIL IS IRON
Line_2259	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MA OR THE NAIL IS STEEL OR IRON SO SO THE MAGNET ATTRACTS IT
Line_2260	ONLY IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY METAL'S STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2261	MAGNETS STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR ST
Line_2262	A NAIL MUST BE MADE OF ALUMINIUM
Line_2263	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS CERTAIN KIND OF METALS AND THE OTHER NAIL MUST BE ALUMINIUM SO IT IS NOT ATTRACTING TO THE MET
Line_2264	IT IS A STEEL OR IRON THAT WILL ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET
Line_2265	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_2266	I THINK THAT THE STEEL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE ALUMINIUM IS LIKE NOT A STRONG IT
Line_2267	I NOTICED THAT ONLY HUGELY THE METALS ON OR OBJECTS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2268	I THINK IT HAS STEEL OR IRON INS
Line_2269	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2270	THEY ST
Line_2271	I THINK THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STE
Line_2272	UM WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS INTRACT
Line_2273	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE EITHER TWO NORTH POLES OR SOUTH POLES FACING EACH OTHER
Line_2274	UH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO SOUTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER MAN
Line_2275	THEY UM LIKE RUNS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2276	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND PUSHING AWAY FROM EACH O
Line_2277	I THINK THIS MIXTURE IS THE
Line_2278	THINK E SHE'S TRYING TO SEE WHICH DIRECTION SHE IS GOING
Line_2279	AND BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MAKE THE COMPASS NOW WHICH WAY THEY'RE FACING
Line_2280	IT IS BECAUSE THE DICK
Line_2281	NAIL IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_2282	ALLY IT WAS RECORDING ME
Line_2283	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_2284	THE MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE
Line_2285	YOU I CAN SEE THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS WEAKER
Line_2286	THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_2287	UM THEY DO NOT HAVE STRONG ENOUGH FORCE TO ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO FAR APART
Line_2288	THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT YOU NEED GETS SMALLER
Line_2289	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGN-
Line_2290	AND ELECTRO MAGNET IS A MAGNET THAT HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_2291	THE WIRES IS WRAPPED ABOUND THE RIVET
Line_2292	I NOTICE THAT IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IT INCLUDES THE SWITCH BUT IT ALSO HAS A D CELL YOUR HAVE ENERGY
Line_2293	WITH OUT THE ENERGY THEN IT WILL NOT BE AN ELECTROMAGNET MAGNET AND THE RIVET WILL NOT ATTRACT ANY WASHERS
Line_2294	YOU NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STOPS UM AROUND THE RIVET'S
Line_2295	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN THE ENERGY WILL JUST STOP
Line_2296	THE ENERGY STOPS AND THE MAGNET IS NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT ANYTHING ANYMORE
Line_2297	UHM THE FLOW THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIRE FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_2298	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2299	I I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2300	YOU'D GOOD
Line_2301	THERE IS IT ISN'T A COMBINATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNET
Line_2302	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE RING AROUND THE MAGNET TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2303	THE UM THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND IT ATTRACTS THE WASHERS
Line_2304	IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2305	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE RO MAGNET IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2306	YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS NO WASH WASHERS ATTACHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2307	IT DOES BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2308	YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE BOTTOM THAT IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2309	IF YOU ADD MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2310	CHANGES BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING AROUND THE RIVET AND IT IS GETTING MORE ENERGY SO IT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2311	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT TRAVELS
Line_2312	BECAUSE IT THIS LIGHT IS REFLECTING
Line_2313	YOU CAN IT REFLEX IT CAN REFLECT AND I CAN REFLECT ONTO SOMETHING
Line_2314	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF AND IT IS REFLECTING
Line_2315	B WITH OUT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DARK
Line_2316	IT UM REFLECTS OFF ON UM SOME THINGS BUT SOME THINGS IT CAN NOT REFLECT AS WE
Line_2317	IT REFLECTS OFF THE OBJECTS THAT IT HITS IN THE UM
Line_2318	YOU OBSERVE THE LIGHT REFLECT
Line_2319	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING AND IT IS BOUNCING BACK AT THE STUDENT
Line_2320	IT CAN KEEP REFLECTING IF IF IT'S POSITION DRY AND FROM THE LIGHT IT IS STRONG ENOUGH
Line_2321	I THINK THE FLASH LIGHT WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LEFT AND THE CORNER START BECAUSE OF HOW
Line_2322	HER UM PENCIL IS REFLECTING BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENCILS IN THE WATER BUT THERE REALLY IS ONLY ONE
Line_2323	HE NOTICED THAT THE PENCIL REFLECTS OFF THE GLASS
Line_2324	AND THE GLASS WITH WATER IN IT IT IS REFLECTING AND THE WITH THE GLASS WITH AIR NOTHING IS HAPPENING
Line_2325	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT IS UM CAN PLAIN TO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2326	ITS CAN COME FROM ENERGY
Line_2327	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE WHIGHT LIGHT MAKES THE CANDLE GREEN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE ANY COLOR
Line_2328	YOU NOTICE THAT THE PRISM SPLITS SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE LIGHT INTO DIFFERENT FORMS
Line_2329	SEEN THAT THE PRISM SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE LIGHT
Line_2330	YOU CAN SEE THAT IT PUTS INTO SIX DIFFERENT COLORS AND IT IS THE COLORS OF THE
Line_2331	CAN NOTICE THAT UM IN A LIGHT BULB ALL THE COLORS ARE WHIT AND WHEN SPLITS INTO THE PREPRISUM IT SPLITS INTO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2332	I THINK THAT SIX DIFFERENT COLORS ARE ENCLOSED IN THE WHIGHT LIGHT
Line_2333	YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS GOING TOWARDS THE BULB THAT IT WHIGHT LIGHT AND WHEN IT REFLECTS THE BULB THE LIGHT IS BLUE THAT REFLECTS
Line_2334	UM THAT EVERY COLOR IS A WHIGHT IS ATTRACTING TO THE YELLOW BULB AND YELLOW IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB
Line_2335	THAT UM THE WHIGHT LIGHT IS ATTRACTING THE BULB AND ON THE YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE YELLOW BULB
Line_2336	UM YOU NOTICE THAT WHIT LIGHT IS HITTING THE BULL AND YELLOW LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THE BUL
Line_2337	THAT ON THE BLUE BULB BLUE LIGHT WOULD REFLECTS IT AND ON THE YELLOW BULB YELLOW LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
Line_2338	YOU NOTICE THAT S DIFFERENT OBJECTS CAN TURN INTO DIFFERENT COLORS DEPENDING ON WHICH COLOR THE OBJECT IS
Line_2339	THE YELLOW BULB CHANGES INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE DIFFERENT LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS
Line_2340	COLOR CHANGED AND IF IT IS A DIFFERENT OBJECT THEN IT WILL NOT CHANGE INTO THAT COLOR IF IT IS A CERTAIN COLOR OBJEC
Line_2341	YOU THINK THAT ONLY SOME UM COLORS LIGHT WILL CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE LINE
Line_2342	CAUSE IT HAS T YOU HAVE EVERY OTHER COLOR BESIDES GREEN UM O TRIEN LIKE GREEN
Line_2343	THE COLOR RED BECAUSE THE BRICK IS A RED
Line_2344	UM IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UHM IT DOES NOT NEED THAT COLOR
Line_2345	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN SCIENCE ENERGY
Line_2346	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_2347	D CELL RAY WIRES LIGHT BULB
Line_2348	THE WIRES COULD CONNECT TO LEAR I MEAN TO LIGHT BULB AND UH SHINE WITH THE BEAKER
Line_2349	WIRE A PATHWAY
Line_2350	THE BATTERIES HAVE ENERGY AND THEN SO THEY CAN MAKE THINGS WORK
Line_2351	YOU COULD LIGHT UP ANY T
Line_2352	OT SOURCE UH COULD GET ENERGY
Line_2353	THE PAST IS UM UH THINK
Line_2354	WIRES CARRY IN THE CIRCUIT IS THEEMICAL CARRY ES IN
Line_2355	IKE LIKE DO COULD MAKE ANYTHING SHI
Line_2356	IT MEANS THAT YOU COULD LIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING
Line_2357	YOU COULD PUT SOME OF THE WIRES TO LI AND THE TRY TO MAKE IT SH
Line_2358	I SEE UM THE WIRES ARE REACHING TO LIGHT BULB AND HIT ABOUT D CELL D TO MAKE THEIR LIGHT BULB
Line_2359	ENERGY FROM THE OUT IS GOING TO THE UH TWO OR
Line_2360	IF YOU USE D CELL ENERGY WITH THE WIRES THE WIRES WILL GET ENERGY TO IT LIKE BULB
Line_2361	THE POSITIVE SIDE UM GETS THE ENERGY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES UM GIVES HIS ENERGY TO A LIGHT
Line_2362	THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES SO LIKE WELL ON THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE WIRE
Line_2363	THE BLUE THOUGHTS REPRESENTS THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_2364	FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE TO GO TO A NEGATIVE SIDE THEN
Line_2365	ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS WITH THE POSITIVE
Line_2366	ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2367	IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE ONE I ONE WIRE HAS BE CONNECTED TO THE A
Line_2368	IT WON'T WORK IF THEY'RE ON THE BRACE BUT IF THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WOULD WORK
Line_2369	IT MEANS THAT THE YOU
Line_2370	ENERGY HAS UH TO METTLE THROUGH THE IRONS TO THE MO
Line_2371	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH WIRES SO THE MOTOR
Line_2372	IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2373	T THE MOTOR WORKS
Line_2374	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2375	WHEN IT'S OPEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T MOVE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_2376	IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT T
Line_2377	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPEN CIRCU
Line_2378	THE SUN HITS THE SOLAR PANEL IS AND IT SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY TO WORK
Line_2379	THAT MEANS THAT IT'S WORKING SO THERE'S LIKE SOL
Line_2380	AH BECAUSE THE ENERGY GOES
Line_2381	THE FLAG WON'T MOVE BECAUSE THE SOLAR PENNERS MADE SIGHT
Line_2382	THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY AND THEN IT CO SO THE MOTOR
Line_2383	THE MOTOR IS SQUISHING
Line_2384	THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE OF THE ST
Line_2385	THE SOLAR PANEL'S ARE AREN'T GETTING ENERGY FROM THE
Line_2386	WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH
Line_2387	THERE IS A BATTERY WIRES A MOTOR A NAIL AND A SW
Line_2388	SWITCH CHANDINAIOL
Line_2389	WITH THE PAPER CLIPS THE MOTOR IS WASHING
Line_2390	WITH A SPUNGIT WE'D OR
Line_2391	S LUNG THEY ARE MADE THROUGH COPPER IRON
Line_2392	S SOME OF THEM WERE
Line_2393	THE MOTOR ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE STICK IS A WOOD
Line_2394	IT HAS AN CLOSED CIRCUIT P IT HAS WOOD BUT NOT STEEL OR IRON OR COP
Line_2395	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S OR
Line_2396	UM IT IT IS NOT UNLIKE THE OTHERS
Line_2397	BECAUSE THE STRAW IS RUBBER
Line_2398	THE BRASS SWING RING DOES WITH ST LIKE COPPER AND COPPER LIKE METAL
Line_2399	THE CIRCUIT STOPS THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_2400	WITH OUR ENERGY UHM WE WON'T LIST
Line_2401	A CANDLE
Line_2402	THE CANDLE HAS ENERGY FROM FIRE SO
Line_2403	YES IT WAS A HOT
Line_2404	ENERGY- EN
Line_2405	THE ENERGY IS LIKE THE SOURCE
Line_2406	YES I HEAR RIGHT SO
Line_2407	IT I STARTED TO FLAME UP
Line_2408	I COULD SEE UH
Line_2409	YOU GET ENERGY BY HITTING THE DR
Line_2410	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE I DON'T T
Line_2411	I SEE ENERGY APPLES THE CANDLE THE WOOD AND THE GASOLINE
Line_2412	THE AIR IS GETTING THIRTER YEAH
Line_2413	H YEAH
Line_2414	UH THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GETTING ENERGY AND THERE IS GOING TO THE MODE END THE WATER IS MADE
Line_2415	THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ENERGY AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ENERGY LIKE CARS YEAH OR
Line_2416	RENEWES OH
Line_2417	CARS AND TRAINS USE GAS AND COAL TO WORK
Line_2418	UH IT WOULD BURN ON THE A WE'RE GETTING FUN AND
Line_2419	BECAUSE THE CRANES
Line_2420	IT BECAUSE WITH SETTLE ENERGY WE WELL ALL DI
Line_2421	IT'S IS THINGS ARE GO TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK WITH ENERGY
Line_2422	ENERGY HAS TO GO TO A LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL BULB
Line_2423	THE D CELL HAS ENERGY THAT GOES THROUGH THE THAT'S
Line_2424	IT'S GOING IN FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING IN THERE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_2425	THOSE WERE ARE THE ENERGY SO
Line_2426	THE I DOTS ARE ENERGY ELSE IN THE LIGHT AND AND THROUGH THE WIRES AND
Line_2427	THE FROM THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN TO
Line_2428	IT PULLS U CUS
Line_2429	THERE IS FROM THE WIRES IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE WATER
Line_2430	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WON'T BE THAT MUCH RIGHT
Line_2431	THE LIGHT BULBS WOLVES UN SHINE THAT MUCH ANYMORE
Line_2432	THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH LIGHT AND THEN SO THERE BE SO BRIGHT IN
Line_2433	OH IT'S TWO D CELLS ABOUT THE LIGHT BULBS GET UM BRIGHTER AND WITH ONE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE THAT BRIGHT
Line_2434	THERE NEEDS TO BE A POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE TARREL GOING A
Line_2435	METERS
Line_2436	WE ARE USING A BAL ON SOLAR PANELS AND HOW WERE
Line_2437	THAT IT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO
Line_2438	IT SHARES IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_2439	THERE ARE SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2440	THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEY SHARE NERVE AND THIS SERIES CIRCUIT DO NOTHING THAT NO
Line_2441	PARONELW ANTELIH
Line_2442	THAT'S CIRCUITS YEAH YEAH ALL
Line_2443	THE THE LIGHT BULBS GO BURN AND OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOT OF ENERGY
Line_2444	UM THEY'RE
Line_2445	IT IS A PARALLEL UM A
Line_2446	IT THROWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE BUT NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_2447	YES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS WARNING OUT BECAUSE IT HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND AND THE OTHER ONES ARE HER I DON'T THAT ONES ARE
Line_2448	LET'S HAVE GONE
Line_2449	THE PILES ON
Line_2450	ON
Line_2451	WE HAVE LEARNING IN SCIENCE A WE ARE DOING AREA AND SCIENCE
Line_2452	BECAUSE THERE IS A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2453	IT WOULD EX BECAUSE WHEN IT TOOK CLOSE CIRCUIT
Line_2454	STRINGS ARE LIGHTS ARE A
Line_2455	THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED OR IT WOULD WORK
Line_2456	THE LIGHTS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_2457	ONE OF A
Line_2458	THE ENERGY DOESN'T UM GO E IT DOESN'T SHOW THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB ANYMORE
Line_2459	ITS WELL
Line_2460	IT IS NOT AND IT IS A ST A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2461	I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE FORMS ARE BREAKING BECAUSE OF SHARING ENERGY
Line_2462	UM UH IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A
Line_2463	THAT THE FIRST ONE IT'S UM IT SHOWS HOW IT BRAKES AND THE SECOND ONE SHOWS HOW IT'S THE
Line_2464	IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE IF ONE OF THEM IS BROKEN THEN THE OTHER LIKE WON'T WON'T WORK BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS THOU
Line_2465	BECAUSE THE LIGHT ROOM UM IS THE ONE THAT GIVES IT
Line_2466	E NEXT I BARE
Line_2467	THEY ARE MAGNETS
Line_2468	THE AH SIX TENS A REFRIGERATOR
Line_2469	I COULD
Line_2470	A THE MAGNETS STICK TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_2471	MAGNETS COULD STICK ON TO ANYTHING THAT'S IS M
Line_2472	MAKE IT REACT TO ANOTHER MAGNETS OR ELSE STEEL
Line_2473	A WITHIN
Line_2474	THE MAGNET STICK TO IS ATTRACTING TO THE NAIL
Line_2475	WHY HE'S STICKING SODA MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL OR HER
Line_2476	THE MAGNETS ONE ATTRACTS TO DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT IS LIKE STEEL AND THE WOOD IS
Line_2477	LOOKING AT WARDS THROUGH SIX RE MAGNETS IRON AND STEEL BURN COPPER NO OTHER MAGNET
Line_2478	IT WON'T STICK TO A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET I MEAN THE NAIL IS IRON OR STEEL AND THEN THE WIRE IS IT
Line_2479	LIGHT BULBS HAVE IRON DEAL
Line_2480	MAGNETS STICK TO IRON
Line_2481	IT STICK TO IRON NAIL IS TEN MORE BUT NOT WOOD
Line_2482	SO NAILS CAN BE COVERSAL YOU CAN LIFT UP THE YOU CAN LIFT IT UP WITH A MAGNET
Line_2483	WAIT DIFFERENT ABOUT NAILS ARE ONE OF THEM IS STEEL OR ELSE IRON AND ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2484	EACH NAIL ONE OF THE NAIL IS NOT STICKING BUT ONE IS
Line_2485	ONE OF THE NOW MIGHT BE STEEL OR IN BUT ONE MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2486	N BECAUSE IT WOULD B
Line_2487	OWNMAM
Line_2488	I THINK THE STEEL S IS CAN ON THROUGH THEM
Line_2489	ITS THREE OF THEM DON'T STICK OR DO STICK
Line_2490	IT WANTS TURN
Line_2491	YES
Line_2492	I THINK IT'S IS A STEEL
Line_2493	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_2494	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE TIP OF IRON THAT'S STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_2495	IT MAY HAVE IRON
Line_2496	UH WHEN THE BELL OF IRON NAMITODUM AND HELP YOU A W
Line_2497	THE MAGNET IS STICKING ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS ON SOUTH AND
Line_2498	THE POOL IT'S GOING AWAY THE MAGNET IS GOING LIKE B
Line_2499	EITHER ARE FACING SO NORTH OR NOR SOUTH
Line_2500	IT TAKE COMPASS TH THAT TO WOLD NORTH AND SOUTH A MAGNET
Line_2501	Y FUNCTION BECAUSE IT IT IS ATTRACTING A OTHER MAGNET'S
Line_2502	WE HAVE THEM WORKING ON MAGNET FIELDS
Line_2503	MAGNETISM IS KI TIPES OF MAGNET
Line_2504	THEY ARE STILL STINKING TOGETHER
Line_2505	THE PAPER RIDGE YOU COULD BETWEEN THE MAGNET CIRCLING CAN THE PAPER CLIP ES TWO
Line_2506	I HAD TO WATCH FOR WS
Line_2507	IT'S THE H I O ON
Line_2508	THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS TICKING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2509	THE NAIL ISN'T GIVING IT'S N'T GETTING FAST THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_2510	IT IS SHOWING YOU THE FIELD AROUND THE N
Line_2511	THAT A MAGNET HAD SO FIELD AROUND IT
Line_2512	THE MAGNET HAS A FILTER AROUND IT AND IT'S GOING TO THE NAIL IN TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2513	MAGNETIC FIELDS
Line_2514	IT WON'T WOR BECAUSE YOU NEED NINETY ONTO THE MAGNET WILL PRET
Line_2515	THE MARKER'S SO SEPARATE AND THE THEY WALK THE SON NINETEEN
Line_2516	THE MAGNETS ARE WITH THE FLOOR ARE GETTING THE SPACERS
Line_2517	THE BAGS WOULD BE SEPARATE WOULD BE SEPARATE WITH LESS MAGNET
Line_2518	IT'S A BATTERY A SWITCH SOME WIRES WIRE AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_2519	A IT'S IS
Line_2520	YOU IN A NATURE USE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR IT TO WORK
Line_2521	WHEN IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STARTS GOOD
Line_2522	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THAT MEANS AT FLOW OVER ELECTRICITY IT WILL GO UP TO NOWHERE
Line_2523	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T MOR BECAUSE IT'S GOING OFF TO MILE AND THERE IS NO MAGNETS STICKING ON TO IT TO THE NEIL
Line_2524	IT WON'T WORK
Line_2525	THEY ARE D CELLS BATTERY WASHERS A SWITCH A WIRE AND A STEEL THROUGH IT
Line_2526	IT WON'T I STAY ELECTRIC ELECTRICITAL VAG
Line_2527	MAGNET ELECTRICITY COALS SO TO MAGNETS A
Line_2528	THAT'S UM AN ELECTRICITY
Line_2529	BECAUSE THE RIVET'S ISN'T ISN'T A MAGNET AND SO THE ELECTRICITY IS
Line_2530	YOU I SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2531	IT'S A CORE TO SEE THINGS BEAK
Line_2532	IT SOMETIMES IF IT HAS THE METER I REFLICTS HOW BY IT HAS YOUR EYE THEN YOU COULD SEE THE LIGH
Line_2533	THAT FRIGHT REFLECTS TO ANYTHING
Line_2534	THE REFLEX OUT OF ALMOST EVERY THING
Line_2535	IF THEY HIT ONE OF THE OPTS IN THE ROOM IT REFLECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_2536	IN THE ROBIE THE LIGHT REFLEXES TO ALMOST ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WALL
Line_2537	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING THROUGH THE MIRROR AND THEN GOING INTO THE PERSON'S I
Line_2538	WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT YOUR PENCIL IS IN THE WATER
Line_2539	WHEN IT IS LOWERED INTO THE WATER UH THE PENCIL MOVES
Line_2540	THAT THE LIGHT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT COULD MAKES THE PLACE UM LIGHTER
Line_2541	A THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM IS GOING FIRST IT'S WEIGHT
Line_2542	THE LIGHT GOES TO THE PRISM AND IN IT'S RAINBOW CA
Line_2543	IT TURNED INTO A RAMBO LIGHT COLORS
Line_2544	I C SEVEN COLORS S
Line_2545	THEY ARE WHITE AND THEN THEY SPREAD ON TO WATER'S
Line_2546	SEEN
Line_2547	WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON IT REFLICTS TO THE BLUE BULB
Line_2548	WHEN IT'S BOUNCING OFF OF THE BULB THE BULB IS BLUE SO THE LIGHT IS TURNING BLUE WHEN IT HITS THE BLUE BULB
Line_2549	IT IS A REFLECT THING THROUGH THE BALL
Line_2550	IT IS SHINING YELLOW ONE ABOUT THROUGH THE ROOM
Line_2551	THEY TURN RED OR ELSE STARK
Line_2552	YES BECAUSE IT WOULD TURN TO THE COLOR THAT IS A DARKER
Line_2553	WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH THE FILTER THAT IS MAKING IT BLUE OR ELSE
Line_2554	IT WILL JUST TURNS DIRECT
Line_2555	IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR SO THAT WE
Line_2556	BECAUSE IT IS
Line_2557	WHEN WHEN YOU HAD A CLICK ON THE GREEN OR BLUE WORK FOR WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE RED ONE A
Line_2558	THE WATER PLACE THEY SALT EQUALS SALT WATER THAT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2559	A A SOLUTE
Line_2560	THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE CAN MAKE SALT WATER
Line_2561	A SOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIXTURES BECAUSE ONE ITEM HAS DISSOLVED INTO THE OTHER ITEM
Line_2562	THIS SALT
Line_2563	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT IT SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT IT BECOMES A PART OF THE WATER SO IT STILL ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2565	I IT'S ALL ADDED UP AND A NEW WEIGHT
Line_2566	THE MASS IS GETTING GREIGHTER
Line_2567	THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND IF YOU ADD THEM IT GOES SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_2568	TH WATER HAS GAINED FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT AND THEREFORE IT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2569	YOU CAN USE A COFFOY FILTER OR YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT
Line_2570	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2571	IT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL THE SAND CAN NOT MIX WITH THE THE WATER BECAUSE IT CAN'T DISSOL
Line_2572	IT HAS TURNED INTO A A MIXTURE
Line_2573	THIS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID HAS BLENDED IN TO THE WATER
Line_2574	YOU HAVE TO DISSOLVED THE WATER
Line_2575	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT AND THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUTE
Line_2576	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_2577	IT THE WATER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2578	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE
Line_2579	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE M
Line_2580	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTE TO A SEPARATED
Line_2581	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES
Line_2582	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE USING EVAPORATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT WITH A FILTER
Line_2583	THEY ARE USING A MAGNET TO TAKE OUT THE PINS
Line_2584	THEY ARE SEPARATING GRAVEL AS ROCKS WITH A FILTER
Line_2585	GRAVEL AND WATER
Line_2586	SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_2587	THE GRAVEL IS BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER USING A SCREEN
Line_2588	THE MAGNET IS SUCKING UP THE LITTLE PENS WITH MAGNETITE
Line_2589	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN CAN FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_2590	I NOTICED THAT THEY WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS WERE IN THE MAGNET PICKED THEM RIGHT UP BECAUSE THEY'RE MAGNETIC
Line_2591	I I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL GOT SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FIT THROUGH
Line_2592	BECAUSE THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH IT AND THE GRAVEL CAN
Line_2593	THIS IS THE BEST FOR USING EVAPORATION TO SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE WA
Line_2594	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2595	TO MAKES A SOLUTION YOU NEED A POWDER THAT CAN DISSOLVE INTO WATER
Line_2596	THE GREAT POWDER IS GETTING PUT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2597	YOU CAN WEIGH IT WITH A SCALE OR YOU CAN SEE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2598	ONE SOLUTION HAS MORE GREYGHT POWDER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2599	I SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE SCOOPS IN THE FIRST ONE AND THEN ONE SCOOPS AND THE SECOND ONE
Line_2600	YOU CAN WEIGH BOTH SOLUTIONS USING GRAMS AND THE ONE THAT WEIGHS MORE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2601	A SNAIL
Line_2602	THEY'RE DIFFERENT IN COLOR
Line_2603	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS USUALLY HAVE A MORE POWDER
Line_2604	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE WITH LIGHTER
Line_2605	THE LIGHTER COLOR SOLUTIONS ARE DILUTED
Line_2606	IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWER
Line_2607	I THINK IT WOULD TASTE STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE POWDER YOU HAVE THE STRONG METAL BET
Line_2608	IT WOULD TASTE LIGHTER AND MORE DILUTED
Line_2609	IT WOULD NOT BE AS STRONG AS THE ONE WITH THE MORE GREY POWDER
Line_2610	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER TO THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2611	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_2612	Y YOU CAN ADD MORE POWDER OR ADD MORE WATER
Line_2613	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2614	WE HAVE MADE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS AND COOLED SOLUTIONS
Line_2615	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM BECAUSE THE SALTS ADDS WEIGHT TO THE WATER
Line_2616	THE ROCK IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FEATHER BECAUSE THE FEATHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINE GRAMS
Line_2617	ITS IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2618	ONE CUP HAS TEN PER TEN GRAMS MORE SOLUTE
Line_2619	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE SO THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2620	IS WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2621	ONE HAS TEN MORE GRAMS OF SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_2622	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE OF THE SOLUTE THE ONE IN THE LEFT HAS LESS AND IT WEIGHS LESS
Line_2623	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM A
Line_2624	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2625	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2626	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2627	SOLUTIONS BE
Line_2628	M MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2629	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2630	IT'S DISSOLVING THE SALT AND IT'S GETTING A SATURATED
Line_2631	THE WATER IS GETTING I CONCENTRATED
Line_2632	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2633	THAT MEANS THE WATER CANNOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT INTO IT
Line_2634	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED WITH SHROOGER
Line_2635	IT CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY WARM OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2636	THIS SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2637	THE UH THE SALT ADDS A WEIGHT
Line_2638	WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOIL
Line_2639	THAT MEANS IT'S NOT SOLUBLE
Line_2640	THE POWDER IS SORT
Line_2641	YOU NEED A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENTS
Line_2642	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_2643	THE WATER IS GETTING SATURATED
Line_2644	THAT MEANS THE UH WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2645	THE EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2646	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATUR
Line_2647	THE THE WATER CANNOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT SALT
Line_2648	IT LEAVES SOME OF THE SALT IN THE BOTTOM
Line_2649	ONE OF THE SIDES IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN
Line_2650	WE'VE BEEN MAKING D SOLUTIONS AND CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2651	EACH SOLUTE EACH ONE OF THE THINGS IS A SOL
Line_2652	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2653	SATURATING SOLUTIONS
Line_2654	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTIONS TOGETHER TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2655	IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2656	WE MIXED CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND THEN CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND CITRIC ACID AND THEN FINALLY BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
Line_2657	I THINK SO BECAUSE BAKING SODA WHEN IT IT WHEN IT HITS WATER IT FIZZES
Line_2658	WATER THE SOLVENT
Line_2659	THEY MIX TOGETHER AND SEPARATE
Line_2660	THEY ARE MIXED TO CREATE A NEW MOLECULES
Line_2661	THEY WILL MIX TOGETHER AND CREATE CHEMICAL REACT
Line_2662	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2663	THE SOLUTION HAS LEFT US PRECIPITATE
Line_2664	IT HAS MADE A NEW MOLECUE
Line_2665	THERE HAVE BEEN PURPLE MOLECULES CREATED IN THE WATER
Line_2666	IT CANNOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF THE WATER
Line_2667	I TOO
Line_2668	IT GETS COLD
Line_2669	THE TWO MIXTURES THE TWO SOLUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT I WOULD TAKE
Line_2670	YES BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS TURNED PINK
Line_2671	IT HAS MADE IT AT
Line_2672	HE MADE A POOP IN THE BOWL
Line_2673	ACTION IT'S HAPPY IT'S GETTING THE RIGHT
Line_2674	THERE IS A CEMICTHE BY CA
Line_2675	I WENT INTO
Line_2676	ARE TWO STICKS IT
Line_2677	YES BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING
Line_2678	IT HAS MADE A CEMCARYACTTA
Line_2679	YES BECAUSE THE GRAPE THE WATER WAS TURNED PURPLE
Line_2680	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OR CURVING
Line_2681	TWO REACTIONS A COMBINING
Line_2682	IF THERE IS A PRODUCTS
Line_2683	THE PRODUCTS IS THE REMAINING THING AT THE BOTTOM
Line_2684	BAKING SODA AND IT CAMICALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2685	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2686	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL AND SOIL ROCKS AND SLAM FORMS
Line_2687	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_2688	WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOILS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2689	I SEE LOTS OF CLAY SILT GRAVEL AND HUMUS
Line_2690	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2691	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2692	THERE ARE THESE SOIL'S ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2693	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2694	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2695	SAND CLAY GRAVEL PEAVEELS AND ORGANIC MATTER
Line_2696	ALL SOILS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT CLIMETS
Line_2697	THEY BOTH THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT AND REAL S
Line_2698	THEY ARE SPREADING OUT THROUGH THE GRAVEL SO
Line_2699	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY MOST OF THEM HAVE SAND
Line_2700	THE DELTA HAS MORE HUMRIS AND MORE SAND AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A TINY BIT OF GRAVEL
Line_2701	IN THE DELTA THERE IS A MORE SAND IN THE DESERT THERE IS MORE GRAVEL THAN SAND
Line_2702	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS SOIL AND THEN FARM
Line_2703	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STREAM TABLE S
Line_2704	THE STREAM TABLE WITH THE SLOPE HAS A BIGGER FAN THE ONE WITH OUT THE SLOPE HAS A SMALLER FAN
Line_2705	A RIVER THAT IS STEEP IT FLOWS DOWN A RIVER THAT IS FAT IT GOES SLOW
Line_2706	IN THE ONE WITH THE DEEP SLOW THEY'RE THE WATER IS GOING FAST FOR THE THE FLAT IS GOING SLOW
Line_2707	THE WATER ON THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING SLOW AND THE WATER IN THE SLEEP STEEP SLOPE IS GOING FAST
Line_2708	THE FLOW OF THE WATERS GETS FASTER
Line_2709	ONE I TWO GUMS I MAKE BUBBLES
Line_2710	THE FLOOD CONDITIONS HAVE MAKE MORE CANIONS THAN THE STANDARD CONDITIONS
Line_2711	DIRING THE FLOOD THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_2712	ONES FASTER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_2713	IT PICKS UP AND STUDY'S GOING FASTER
Line_2714	IN TWENTY FOR STEP N THE FLUID HAS TAKEN DOWN TREES AND ROCKS THROUGH THE LAND
Line_2715	AN EARTHQUAKE
Line_2716	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS CRACKING BECAUSE OF WEATHER
Line_2717	CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2718	THE ROCK HAS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS THAT IS CALLED PHYSICAL WEATHERING
Line_2719	THE ROCK S SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS
Line_2720	I NOTICED THAT THE ROCK CAN WENT DOWN THROUGH WATER AND WAS STILL MOVING
Line_2721	THE RUSTS ARE BREAKS ARE GOING INTO THE ROCK AND ARE EXPANDING TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2722	WHEN WATER FILLS UP A CRACK IN THE ROCK AND IT FREESES THEN THE THE ICE EX THE WATER EXPANDS AND CRACKS THE
Line_2723	WHEN WATER GETS INTO A CRACK OF ROCK IT FREEZES AND EXPANDS TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2724	THE WATER GOT INTO THE ROCK AND FROZE AND EXPANDED TO CRACK THE ROCKS
Line_2725	IT EXPANDS AND
Line_2726	THE FREEZING JAR HAS A CRACKED THE ICE BECAUSE THE WATER HAS EXPANDED
Line_2727	THE WATER HAS EXPANDED AND BROKE THE GLASS
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE WATER EXPANDS
Line_2729	THE PILE OF ROCKS AT THE ON THE LEFT ARE PEBBLES AND THE AND THE ROCKS ON THE RIGHT ARE GRAVEL
Line_2730	THE ONES ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_2731	WETHERRY CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2732	BECAUSE THE DELTA THE GRAVEL HAS A HIT ON THE ROCKS GOING DOWN
Line_2733	THEY WHAT'S GO ON IS T BE IN OR FLAG REC F
Line_2734	GOOD BYE THANK YOU I LOVE YOU WHAT YOU MAN MEAN
Line_2735	AERROSIAN
Line_2736	I REALLY GOT TO GO THE BUTTON
Line_2737	THERE IS WATER WITH A STEEP SLEEP AND ONE THE CLIFF THAT IS FLAT
Line_2738	ON THE UH THE STEEP SLOW THE WATER IS GOING FAST
Line_2739	I TOLD YOU ALL IT I
Line_2740	THE FLOOD IS GOING FAST CAUSING MORE ARROGION AND DISPOSITION AND NORMAL IS
Line_2741	DURING THE FLUID THE WIRES GOING EARLY FAST WHEN IT'S NORMAL IT'S DOING NORMAL SPEED
Line_2742	DURING THE FLOOD IT IS GOING REALLY FAST
Line_2743	AT HAS MORE ENERGY
Line_2744	LISTEN TO MY IDEA
Line_2745	A VOLCANIC ERUPTION AND WHY IS IT GOING PERFECT
Line_2746	AND WHY DO YOU TAKE SO LONG TO TALK BLACK
Line_2747	RAPID CHANGES
Line_2748	SLOWED
Line_2749	IT WAS A SLOW
Line_2750	LOUD
Line_2751	CA
Line_2752	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METERS AND HOW LIKE CAN REFLECT TO FOR THEM
Line_2753	BECAUSE A STIR ATE COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR THE THE ELECTROMAGNETISM TO BE INDUCED
Line_2754	THE WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET WHICH INDUCES ELECTRO MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES IT
Line_2755	IT INDUCES A MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES THE RIVET AN ELECTRO MAGNET WHICH IS WHICH ALLOWS IT TO PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_2756	IT IT INDUCES ME OF JETISM BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HASN'T A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2757	IF THERE'S NO FLOW FOR ELECTRICITY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING THE WHOLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2758	HOLE OF THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT EITHER OPENS STOPS THE CIRCUIT OR COMPLETES IT
Line_2759	WELL WITHOUT ELECTRICITY ELECTRO MAGNETS COULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ELECT IT INDUCES THE MAGNET
Line_2760	THE WIRES HAVE THERE HAS TO BE ENOUGH COILS WITH THE WIRE FOR IT TO INDUCED MAGNETISM
Line_2761	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET WHICH IS INDUCING MAGNETISM AND THE WIND WHICH IS ALIGNED IT TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_2762	IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THEY THOSE ARE THE ONLY THING BESIDES MAGNETS AND A MAGNET SIDE THAT CAN PICK UP MAGNETS
Line_2763	THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND MEAIRES
Line_2764	THE HOW YOU SEE THINGS IT'S LIGHT BOUNCES OFF OF THEM WHICH I THEY BOUNCES BACK TO YOUR EYES WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SEE IT
Line_2765	UH WELL IT IS SHOWING LIGHT AND IT'S BOUNCING BACK TO THE EYES AND IT'S STRUCK IN A BOS BOUNDSOM MA
Line_2766	IT BALANCES A L
Line_2767	UM YOU SEEN SOMETHING
Line_2768	UM WHEN IT HITS THE OBJECT IT BOUNCES BACK
Line_2769	THERE IT'S A GLASS
Line_2770	LEARNING ABOUT METERS AND PLUS AND ELECHUM MAGNETS
Line_2771	THERE HAVE LIKE THIS WEIGHT RED THINGS SHINING AWARE ON THE BONE
Line_2772	FLASH LIGHT ON CANDLES LIGHT BULBS
Line_2773	LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH A WHICH IS BREAKING THE WHIGHT LIGHT UP INTO EACH COLOR WHICH ARE ALL THE CLOSE OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2774	UM THERE IT'S WHITE LIGHT THROUGH THE AND OUT IT'S THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2775	IF THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH IT IS WHITE UNTIL HAVE PARTS WHERE IT BURMS TO ALL THE COLORS DURING THE
Line_2776	WELL YOU LIGHT HITTING THE BLUE BULB AND IT'S BOUNCING OUT AS A BLUE LIGHT
Line_2777	ONE INCH IT'S GOING HITTING THE BULB TO LIGHT BOMBS COMING OFF IT'S BLOW
Line_2778	WHEN THE LIGHT THE WEIGHT LIGHT HITS IT EVERY COLOR BUT BLUE IS OBSORBED SO THE BLUE COPPER FLEW OUT
Line_2779	IT'S ONLY CLEAR NOT GETTING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BUL
Line_2780	THE LIGHT WILL SENSE IT'S NOT GLASS BUT IT'S REFLECTING THE BALL AND THAT'S COMING AT AS BLUE
Line_2781	IT'S ABSORBED WITH THE BLUE LIKE IS IT GETS A BOUT REFLECTED
Line_2782	I COULD THE THE BULB T'S THEY BOUNT OFF AS YEAH LOVED BECAUSE EVERY OTHER COLLUSBEING OBSERVED TO PUT YELLOW
Line_2783	THAT NOT ALL OF THEM THAT ARE HITTING THE BULB OR COMING BACK
Line_2784	BULBS REFLECTING BLUE BUT IN THE YELLOW BULBS REFLECTING YELLOW LIGHT
Line_2785	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FILTERING LIGHT AND THE BODY IT'S GETTING FILTER BY THIS RED SHEET
Line_2786	THE NOT CARDS PLACED BEHIND THE FILTER IT TURNS RED BUT WHEN THE BLUE ONE IS IT STILL TURNS BLUE
Line_2787	THAT'S TON DARKER IT'S IN IT TO PLACK SO
Line_2788	SOME WEIGHT THE RED BLUE LIGHT THE WILL DON'T CHANGE THE COLOR BUT THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHT
Line_2789	IT'S THE SAME COAL AS DARK DARK RAIN THE LIGHT AS RED BLUE BUT I GREEN LIGHT IT MAKES IT BRIGHTER
Line_2790	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN UHM GAS
Line_2791	I MEAN IN BLUE LIGHT IT'S JUST AS THE SAME BUT FOR THE RED LIGHT IT
Line_2792	EN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNICS AND MIGHT AND METERS
Line_2793	IT HAS TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
Line_2794	THERE ARE POINS THEY MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2795	BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METERS LIGHTS ELECTROMAGNETS AND FILTERING LIGHTS
Line_2796	THEY EACH OTHER SEPARATE PAINFULLY
Line_2797	IS A STEER NO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2798	PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAKES EACH NO PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE A EACH OF THE LIGHT BULBS HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY THE SAME HERE
Line_2799	UM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TH
Line_2800	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2801	I THINK THIS CIRCUIT IS A SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2802	IT IS A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT CAUSE THEY EACH OTHER ON PATHWAYS
Line_2803	THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH OTHER OWN PATHWAY THEY HAVE A MATH IT WILL SHARE IT
Line_2804	IT'S A SE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2805	S I THINK IT STILL THEY WOULD STILL BE BRIGHTER
Line_2806	THE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ON TOP ARE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2807	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IN THE RIGHT LAST AND THEN THE THE ONE IN THE LIGHT
Line_2808	THE SERIES CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER AND THEN SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE OWN HALTHWAY
Line_2809	I'VE ON LEARNING ABOUT MER SLIGHT FILTERING LIGHTS AND ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2810	A STRING LE LIGHT IS A BUNCH OF LIGHT AND A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2811	THE THE UH THE ONE BURNS OUT TO
Line_2812	BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THAT ON THE ONE IT STOPS A BURNING
Line_2813	UM WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT BURN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SHOWING THE SAME PATH OF ELECTRICITY
Line_2814	UM WHEN ONE DIES OUT THE THE ONE DOES NOT AND WHEN YOU CLICK MEA IT TURNS BACK ON E
Line_2815	WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE THE HE ONE DOES BECAUSE THE SAME THE SHARE THE SAME FLOW
Line_2816	UM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT NO SERIC SEE
Line_2817	IT IT IT STOPS FLOWING IT STOPS IT STOPS GLOW WHEN NO
Line_2818	RE BECAUSE IT'S NO COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANY MORE ONE ONE'S BURNED DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE THE CIRCUIT
Line_2819	UM THEY ARE ALL BRIGHT
Line_2820	LIGHT IT WON'T WEIGH
Line_2821	I THINK IT CAN COME FROM A LIGHT BULB AND OVER HEAD LIGHT
Line_2822	I I CAN SEE A LIGHT BULB
Line_2823	THE LIGHT IS THE HEIGHT LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH A PRISM AND BEING BROKEN APART INTO THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2824	UH BRAKES UP THE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2825	IT IS BEING AND APART INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE FAN THE
Line_2826	L TELL YOU THAT NO I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE LIGHT UM BOUNCES OFF THE BLUE BULB AS BLUE LIGHT
Line_2827	MARAL OH THE UM BLUE BULB IS ILL TURNING THE BLUE LIGHT OUT OF THE WHIGHT LIGHT
Line_2828	IT'S BOUNCING OFF THE BALL BLUE
Line_2829	THE LIGHT IS GETTING FILTWARDS INTO YELLOW LI
Line_2830	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULL A YELLOW LIGHT BECAUSE THE BULL IS RICTING THE YELLOW LIGHT OUT OF THE WEIGH
Line_2831	LIGHT RAISED OTHER HITTING THE BULL OR HIGH THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF FROM THE BULB ARE YELLOW
Line_2832	THA- ARE YEAH THE
Line_2833	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COMPUTORS I MEAN ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2834	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2835	THERE'S SHOWING PATTERNS WHICH
Line_2836	OH CAN HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2837	WE'VE BEEN DOING ENERGY AND CIRCUITS S
Line_2838	THEY'RE FORMING THE CONSOULATION ARI ON
Line_2839	THEY ARE CALLED CONSTOLLATIONS
Line_2840	IT'S A LION
Line_2841	IT RISES FROM THE WEST AND SITS IN THE WEST
Line_2842	WELL THE EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN AND SO IT IS TURNING AROUND CONSTANTLY
Line_2843	THE EARTH GOING ABOUT THE SUN
Line_2844	YOU'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND CIRCUIT
Line_2845	UM I AM NOT REALLY S
Line_2846	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE BOY'S EYES
Line_2847	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AN OFF
Line_2848	LIGHT LETS THESE SEE THINGS UH IT FLICKS OFF THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE THE M
Line_2849	I KNOW THAT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF ANY THING SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
Line_2850	THEY'RE REFLECTING ALFULLY OF THEM
Line_2851	THEY HAVE TO BE SOLID FOR LIGHT TO REFLECT ALU OF THEM
Line_2852	I NOTICED THAT THEY REFLECT OFF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_2853	LIGHT REFLECTS OFF DIFFERENT WAYS THEN IT HITS A SOLID OBJECT
Line_2854	THE LIGHT IS SHINING ON TO THE BOY AND THEN ON TO THE M ER SO THAT HE CAN SEE HIMSELF IN THE MER
Line_2855	BECAUSE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND SHOOTING OVER TO HIM
Line_2856	IT'S BEING USED TO REFLECT LIKE A SPOT LIGHT ON A BUILDING
Line_2857	UM THE LIGHT REFLECTS BACK OVER TO THE FIRST MER
Line_2858	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE MARS AND IT'S HITTING THEM SO THAT THEY REFLECT ON TO THE ONE OTHER MIRROR
Line_2859	THIS THE LIGHT HITS THE LAST STORE
Line_2860	THE PENCIL IS IN THE WATER AND IT'S REFLECTING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BROKEN
Line_2861	T LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING BROKEN
Line_2862	THE WATER THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE WATER TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE PENCIL ON THE LEFT IS BROKEN
Line_2863	WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT HITTING WATER AND B HITTING DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_2864	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND REFLECTION
Line_2865	THEY ARE ALL MAKING A LIGHT WITH ENERGY
Line_2866	YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE CHANGING COLOR S
Line_2867	A CANDLE A LIGHT BULB AND THE SUN
Line_2868	A PRISON BREAKS UP THE WEIGHT LIGHT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW WHITE LIGHTER CAN A WHITE LIGHT CONTAINS ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AND WO
Line_2869	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE BALL E TURNING BLUE
Line_2870	UH YOU I DON'T KNOW
Line_2871	THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THE YELLOW BULB AND TURNING YELLOW AND GOING TO THE SIDES
Line_2872	THERE ONE IS WHICH LIGHT AND ONE IS YELLOW
Line_2873	ONE BULB IS BLUE AND ONE BULB IS YELLOW B
Line_2874	UM IT HAS LIGHT AND YOU'RE BREAKING UP THE LIGHT INTO W
Line_2875	THEY TURNS DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2876	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE THINGS WOULD CHANGE
Line_2877	IT TURNS THE LIGHT BLUE
Line_2878	YELLOW AND BLUE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS SO WHEN THEY MIX TOGETHER THERE THEY KIND OF MAKE OTHER COLOR
Line_2879	S SOME THINGS TURN THE SAME COLOR BUT SOME THINGS TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2880	THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER GREEN BUT THE RED AND THE BLUE WILL MAKE IT LOOK THE SAME
Line_2881	UM WELL THE LIGHT TURNS TO DIFFERENT COLORED THINGS DIFFERENT CO
Line_2882	E BECAUSE IT'S GREEN IT'LL LOOK GREENER
Line_2883	THEY TURN BROWNISH AND THE GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT AND TURNS MORE REDDISH ON THE RED LIGHT
Line_2884	RED AND GREEN ARE AND IT IS BLUE AND GREEN ARE ANY DIFFERENT BUT RIDE IS RATE
Line_2885	UM BAD WE UH
Line_2886	WE'VE LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND CIRCUITS AND LIGHT AND THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AND REFLECTION
Line_2887	AT NIGHT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH LIGHT AND IN DAY THERE IS
Line_2888	THE SUN GOES UP ON THE WEST AND COMES UP ON THE TESTER AND COMES DOWN ON THE WEST AND THERE'S CONSTOLATIONS IN THE SKY
Line_2889	THE CONSOLASTIONS GO AWAY
Line_2890	AT NIGHT THERE'S STAIRS
Line_2891	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT NIGHT THE NIGHT SKY AND LIGHT AND ENERGY AND ALL CIRCUITS AND S OFF
Line_2892	UM IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOON AND THE HOW IT DIES
Line_2893	ITS THE ROTATIONS OF THE MOON
Line_2894	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE MIN GOES AROUND THE SUN
Line_2895	UM DONE WITH THE FIST SECOND
Line_2896	WAINING CRESCENT
Line_2897	IT'S ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE MILE
Line_2898	EITHER MOSTLY FULL OR YEAH THE MOSTLY FULL
Line_2899	I NOTICE THAT THERE LIKE THREE QU YEAH THREE QUARTERS OF THE WEIGHT FOIL
Line_2900	CRESSANTS ARE UM MOST THE UH NOT FUEL
Line_2901	COLOURS
Line_2902	THEY ALL PRODUCE LIKE
Line_2903	IT IS WEIGHT SLIGHT
Line_2904	THE SUN A LIGHT BULB OR CANDLE STICK
Line_2905	IT S LID UP TO MEATY COLOR
Line_2906	S THE RAINBOWS
Line_2907	IT'S A RAIN BLEW
Line_2908	THEIR PRETTY L
Line_2909	I DON'T KNOW THE RA
Line_2910	WHEN THE WEIGHT LIGHT HITS THE BLUE BULB IT TURNS INTO BLUE LIGHT OR
Line_2911	THE ONES IT IN THE BUBBLY IS STILL WHIGHT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE BLUE
Line_2912	S SAME THING JUST THE IT'S JUST YELLOW THIS TIME
Line_2913	S REFLECTING
Line_2914	THE ONE THAT HITS IT IS HITTING A WHITE SPOTS THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE HITTING THE YELLOW SPOT
Line_2915	WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PAPER IT CHANGES THE COLOR OF THE OBJECTS
Line_2916	SHADES OF LIGHT W
Line_2917	THEY CHANGED COLOR
Line_2918	YES I GUESS AT Y
Line_2919	I I DON'T KNOW IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2920	OF COURSE YEAH
Line_2921	LOCABLARIS PUT THE BATTERY ON TOP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2922	A A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_2923	THE PATHWAY MEASURE GOES IN THE WIRE
Line_2924	LIGHT BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT TURN ON THE WIRES AND THE LIGHT THE WIRES CARRIED THE ELECTRICITY TO PAR A LIGHT BULB
Line_2925	WHEN THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON IT'S BECAUSE THE ENERGY CIRCUIT POWERS TO IT D CELL TO THE LIGH
Line_2926	I SEE ELECTRICITY HEATING THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING FOR A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH SO
Line_2927	IT'S ROLLING TO THE MINUS SIGN AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THE PLUS LIGHT AND THEN IT KEEPS ROPTATING AGAIN
Line_2928	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A CIRCUIT THAT CONNECTS
Line_2929	ELECTRICITY FALL AS TOWARD THE POSITIVE
Line_2930	ELECTRICITY AND KEEPS SLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_2931	E POSITIVE SIGN THEN THE ELECTRICITY FILLS SEE THE POSITIVE SIGN
Line_2932	TH THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE OPPOSITE
Line_2933	THE LUNGS GOES TO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2934	THEN YOU FLIP IT IT CHANGES DIRECTIONS
Line_2935	I THINK YOU WOULD I THINK THE L
Line_2936	HEAVY UH GOOD
Line_2937	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2938	THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A BOWL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2939	SOLUTIONS
Line_2940	ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE CHALK MAKE SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
Line_2941	THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
Line_2942	THE SALT WHICH WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE
Line_2944	WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2945	THAT WATER IS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKES A SOLUTION
Line_2946	I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2947	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND TAKING SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKES A MIXTURE
Line_2949	THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE I UP THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED IN
Line_2950	WHERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
Line_2951	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_2952	THE SALT
Line_2953	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_2954	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
Line_2955	THE MASS IS INCREASING
Line_2956	ONE KIND OF GRAM PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS I GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_2957	SOLUTIONS
Line_2958	THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2959	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY A HAND
Line_2960	Y YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATES
Line_2961	THINKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BET
Line_2962	UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2963	SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2964	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2965	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH A LESS COLOR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
Line_2966	I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE ST
Line_2967	IT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_2968	IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVOR FI FALL AND GREAPY
Line_2969	I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTION BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
Line_2970	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
Line_2971	BYE MARNEY IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER
Line_2972	I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRINGLE IS CRAH
Line_2973	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ON CAN F
Line_2974	ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIXED IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM OF SALT WATER SOLUTION A
Line_2975	YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN ITS HAS A DIFFERENT
Line_2976	THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A S ALL TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_2977	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2978	I THINK THE ONE WITH TINY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS
Line_2979	I FOUND OUT THAT NOT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHS A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
Line_2980	BY DOING THE GRAMS ADDING
Line_2981	I SO CLUMS I DON'T KNOW
Line_2982	ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2983	I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2984	BYE MARNEY IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TWO BABAH
Line_2985	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND THAT SALT AND WATER MIXES THE SALT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2986	IT RELATES BY MIX STAYING WATER WITH SOLIDS
Line_2987	WE CALL IT A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIXES TOGETHER
Line_2988	WE WOULD CALL THESE SOLUTIONS
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF CHI MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FILTERS OUT THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
Line_2990	THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS ARE GETTING SEPARATED OUT OF THE MAIN PILES
Line_2991	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE JOINT MASS OF SOLID
Line_2992	TH SCREEN IS FILTERING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_2993	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY A SEPARATED
Line_2994	THE SALT AND WATER
Line_2995	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2996	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND WITH THIS MIXTURE IT BECOMES A SOLUTION NO JUST A MIXTURE
Line_2997	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_2998	WE ARE LEARNING THAT ALL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_2999	THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3000	A A SOLVENT
Line_3001	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND IS BECOMING MIXTURE WITH THE WATER
Line_3002	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECAME A SOLUTION
Line_3003	ALL OF THE MATERIALS WEIGHT DIDN'T ADD OR SUBTRACT THEY ALL JUST GOT ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3004	IT SHOWS US THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS KEEP THEIR SAME MASSES WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3005	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3006	S SOLUTIONS
Line_3007	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3008	IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE B
Line_3009	YOU CAN FILTER IT OUT IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTIONS
Line_3010	THE SALTY WATER DID NOT FILTER OUT
Line_3011	A SOLUTIONS
Line_3012	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3013	IT'S EVAPPORACTING
Line_3014	T'S LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE SO THE MATERIAL IS STILL THERE
Line_3015	YOU COULD LET THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_3016	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACES
Line_3017	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3018	BECAUSE IT SEPARATES THE TWO ANGRY READY
Line_3019	MAGNETS AND A SCREENS
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE SEED SEPARATES A LARGE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN FIT THROUGH THE SMALLER HOLES
Line_3021	CAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THE MAGNET DRAWN ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT
Line_3022	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3023	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL WOULD STAY ON TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WOULD FALL THROUGH THE S SCREEN
Line_3024	EVERY MATERIAL OTHER THAN THE SALT STAYED IN THE FILTER BUT THE SALT FLOWS THROUGH H
Line_3025	TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENTS OUT OTHERS THAN THE SALT
Line_3026	SALT WATER YOU EVAPORATE THE WATER SO THE SALT CRYSTALS CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND THEY TAKE UP TO A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3027	THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3028	HIGH MARTY YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY TODAY NOT
Line_3029	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3030	YOU DISSOLVED A SOLUTE INTO A SOLVENT
Line_3031	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3032	LIKE IN THE GREAT TACTIC EXAMPLE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE PURPLE THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3033	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3034	TASTE COLORAND
Line_3035	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS CONCENTRATION AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE CONCENTRATION
Line_3036	THAT THEY MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3037	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS CONCENTRATE
Line_3038	LESS FLAVOR FUEL
Line_3039	ONE AS MORE WATERY AND ONE TASTE MORE FULL OF LABOUR
Line_3040	ADDING DIFFERENT INGREDIENT
Line_3041	ADDING OR TAKING AWAY WATER
Line_3042	BYE MARNEY I I'LL MISS YOU
Line_3043	GOOD HOW ARE YOU S BARNEY
Line_3044	THE DRINKS ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE DRINKS ON THE RIGHT ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3045	FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GRAPE DRINK MIX YOU CAN TELL E
Line_3046	YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH A BAG ONE
Line_3047	THE CONCENTRATION
Line_3048	ONE OF THE CUPS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THEN THE OTHER C
Line_3049	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3050	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE BECAUSE IT IS HEAVIER
Line_3051	MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WAS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3052	THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND AS IT GOES TO THE RIGHT THEY GET MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3053	THE MOST CONCENTRATED IS ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS TWO
Line_3054	THE MOST IS ONE IS IS TWO
Line_3055	B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SEE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3056	BOY MARNEY I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH
Line_3057	WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE MYSTERY INGREDIENT IN MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS BY FILTERING AND SCREEN ING AND ALL THE SCIENTIFIC STUFF
Line_3058	FIT FLOWS
Line_3059	IT THINGS
Line_3060	THAT SOLUTION OR SATURATED THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3061	ONE HAS MORE DENSITY AND ONE HAS LESS DENSITY
Line_3062	I WOULD THINK
Line_3063	IF THE LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT'S LESS DENSE
Line_3064	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION GOES TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE
Line_3065	THEY ARE CREATING A DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WITH EQUAL CONCENTRATION
Line_3066	ONE RISES TO THE TOP AND ONE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3067	ONE'S MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER SO ONE FLOATS ON THE TOP THE OTHER
Line_3068	THEY POUR SOLUTION A FIRST AND SOLUTION B SECOND
Line_3069	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION A IS MO
Line_3070	BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION PUT ANOTHER SOLUTION EQUALS A BIGGER SOLUTION
Line_3071	THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE LEAST DENSE
Line_3072	THERE'S SEPARATE EGG
Line_3073	BYE MARNEY I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I'M EXCITED FOR OUR NEXT NEXT LESSON
Line_3074	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3075	THE SOLUTION CREATED A SALT WHEN IT DISSOLVED
Line_3076	THE CHEMICALS IN THE MATERIALS CREATING THE SOLUTION MADE SALT
Line_3077	THE INGREDIENTS MADE A NEW PRODUCTS
Line_3078	THE MIXTURE CREATED GAS
Line_3079	THEY CHANGED TO FORM GAS AND SALT
Line_3080	THERE IS DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_3081	THEY TWO MIXED TOGETHER AND MATH HAPPENED
Line_3082	THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
Line_3083	IT TELLS ME THAT EVERY THING ON EARTH CAN BE RE MADE OR A DESTROYED
Line_3084	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE LETS THE GASES GO WHEN ONE KEPT THE GASES SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3085	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND ONE BAG IS CLOSED
Line_3086	WE WEREN'T LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_3087	YOU ARE SEPARATING THEM INTO DIFFERENT PILES WHAT THEY
Line_3088	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A MIXT
Line_3089	THEY ARE IN GROUPS HAND OF WHAT THEY ARE
Line_3090	YOU ARE FILTERING IT OUT SO THAT IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANY
Line_3091	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_3092	IT IS BEEN PORING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT IS IT GOT SEPARATED AND IT IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_3093	THEY DON'T THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3094	IT IS FILTERING OUT THE SAND
Line_3095	THE SALT M
Line_3096	THE SALT GETS DISSOLVED TO MAKES THE WATER HIGHER
Line_3097	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND B
Line_3098	YES YOU CAN GET IT OUT BY UH EVAPORATING THE WATER
Line_3099	ITS CAN NOT GET SEPARATED
Line_3100	MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS CAN NOT
Line_3101	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3102	THEY CAN BE LIKE A Y
Line_3103	GREAT MIXTURE'S BY A SCREEN MAGNETISM AND DENSITY
Line_3104	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
Line_3105	TH A MIXTURE
Line_3106	TO SEPARATE OUT THE ROCKS
Line_3107	BECAUSE THAT THING IS MAGNETIC SO STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_3108	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY BE MAGNETIC AND THEY MIGHT NOT
Line_3109	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC A PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3110	CAUSE PAPER BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3111	IT SEPARATED OUT THE ROCKS BECAUSE THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN FITS IN
Line_3112	BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK MORE EFFICIANTLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3113	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3114	BECAUSE SAND CAN'T GO THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT WORKS
Line_3115	IT WORKED BECAUSE ALL THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT WAS BACK THE N
Line_3116	IT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT HAS TO BE SEPARATED T NO OTHER WAY WOULD WORK
Line_3117	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE ALL DO GET EVERY THING IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_3118	IT'S TRYING TO THE PROVE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TOGETHER IT CHANGES IT'S PROPERTY
Line_3119	YOU ARE MIXING SAND AND WATER TOGETHER TO MAKE AH SAND AND WATER SOLUTION
Line_3120	THE SALT THE SALT WILL
Line_3121	THE SALT GOT MIXED IN AND THE AND DISSOLVED IN THE SAND DID IT'
Line_3122	IT DISSOLVES TO SHOW THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3123	IT IS THE THING THAT IS THAT IS NOT GETTING L
Line_3124	BECAUSE THEY THEY STAND TOGETHER AND IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED
Line_3125	THE SALT IS A SOLUTE AND IT GETS DISSOLVED
Line_3126	IT IS THE SOLVENT AND THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE ONTO IT
Line_3127	A A SOLUTE
Line_3128	IT IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND HEAVIER THAN EACH SEPARATE
Line_3129	WHEN YOU ADD EM TOGETHER IT ADDS THE GRAMS OF THE SALT
Line_3130	IT IS ADDING MORE WEIGHT
Line_3131	IT MEAN THAT WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT HAS MORE WEIGHT
Line_3132	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3133	THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS SO THEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3134	IT'S FIFTY PLUS FIFTY PLUS FIFTY FIFTEEN AND IT SHOWS THAT THE SALT KEEPS IT'S UN PROPER IT KEEPS IT'S OWN WEI
Line_3135	UH A SOLUTION
Line_3136	EN CAN EITHER SEPARATED BY EVAPORATING IT LIKE SALT AND WATER OR USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_3137	YOU'RE SEPARATING OUT THE FLOWER BY PUTTING IT IN THE FILTER AND ARE SEPARATING THE M
Line_3138	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3139	A MIXTURE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SAND WAS SEPARATED AND IF IT HAD STAYED IN THE WATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SOLUTIONS
Line_3140	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3141	THE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED AND INTO THE WATER AND IT COULDN'T BE UM SEPARATED WITH THIS FILTER
Line_3142	SOLUTIONS
Line_3143	A THE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE SALT OUT
Line_3144	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND THEN YOU EVAPORATED IT SO THEN IT IT IT WAS BACK TO A THE SALT AGAIN
Line_3145	IT IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AGAIN
Line_3146	IT IS EVAPORATING
Line_3147	IT WORKS THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION BUT YEAH
Line_3148	ONLY A SALT TO SHOW THAT IT WORKED TO SEPARATE IT OUT
Line_3149	THEY ARE PERFECT SQUARES THE SO THE SALT DIDN'T CONTAIN ITS SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3150	IT REQUIRES TIME YOU NEED TIME TO EVAPORATE STUFF
Line_3151	THAT YOU YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTE FROM A SOLUTION AND YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT AND WATER BY EVAPORATION
Line_3152	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3153	A SOLUTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED HOW YOU MAKE IT US YOU MIX SOMETHING TOGETHER
Line_3154	SOLUTES
Line_3155	YOU CAN SEE BY HOW MUCH HOW THE DIFFERENT THE COLOR IS
Line_3156	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND IT IS DARKER
Line_3157	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3158	THE MORE COOLER IT HAS OR HOW MUCH OR HOW MUCH MORE POWDER IT HAS
Line_3159	THE MORE POWDERS IT HAD
Line_3160	HE DARKER OR LIGHTER THAT COLOR IS
Line_3161	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3162	AT IS LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3163	IT WOULD TASTE MORE FLABERFUL
Line_3164	IT WOULD TASTE LESS CONCENTRATED LESS FLAVERFUL
Line_3165	IT IS NOT AS SWEET AND FLAVERPFUL
Line_3166	YOU CAN UH DO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER SO WIND HAVE LESS IN IT
Line_3167	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER SO T BE MORE SPREAD OUT
Line_3168	AND MORE WATER
Line_3169	BE
Line_3170	WE ARE WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3171	ONE'S A MIXTURE ONES TO SOLUT
Line_3172	THE FEATHER WAYS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WAYS NINETY GRAM
Line_3173	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN
Line_3174	WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF IN SCIENCE
Line_3175	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TWENTY
Line_3176	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOL
Line_3177	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS WILL WEIGH MO
Line_3178	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE WEIGHED OR
Line_3179	BECAUSE ONE HAS TWENTY GRAM THE OTHER HAS TEN
Line_3180	THE GREAT ONE GETS DARKER AND DARKER WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED AND MORE CON
Line_3181	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_3182	THE MOST IS ONES THE LEAST IS THREE
Line_3183	ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRE
Line_3184	YEAH WE'RE
Line_3185	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3186	YOU ADD A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT IT IS
Line_3187	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3188	YOU ADD THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THEM IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3189	THE FIRST ONE HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND THEREFORE IT IS MORE DENSES
Line_3190	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER SO IT IS MORE
Line_3191	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THEREFORE IS IS MORE
Line_3192	HOW DARK OR LIGHT IT IS OR HOW DENSE OR HOW CONCENTRATOR IT IS
Line_3193	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND IS THEREFORE LESS MORE W
Line_3194	THE DARKER ONES ARE A MARGE AND THE LIGHTER ONES ARE LESS DENSED
Line_3195	BE CAUSE IT HAS LESS POWDER IN IT
Line_3196	THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE RAIN FILLS OF THE DRINK MIX AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS AND IS LESS COLORFUL
Line_3197	MORSE IT WOULD HAVE MORE FLAVOR
Line_3198	IT WOULDN'T TASTE AS FLAYERFUL
Line_3199	IF YOU ADD MORE SOLVENTS
Line_3200	THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES EXCEPT FOR THE WATER AND THE TOP RIGHT I I GUESS
Line_3201	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTIONS
Line_3202	THE MIXTURE OF THE TRAIL MIX IS SEPARATING INTO SEPARATE PILES CHOCKLETS NUTS AND RAISINS
Line_3203	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_3204	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TWO A DIFFERENT PILES
Line_3205	THE WATER IS SPLITTING FROM THE MARBLES BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN AND MARBLES CAN'T FIT THROUGH THOSE TINY SPACERS
Line_3206	THE MARBLES SEPARATE FROM THE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN
Line_3207	IT TOOK OUT A IT UM
Line_3208	THE WATER IS NOW A CLEAR
Line_3209	IT EVAPORATES
Line_3210	NOT
Line_3211	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3212	MIXTURES KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOLUTIONS MIXED TOGET
Line_3213	I THAT YOU
Line_3214	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3215	MIXTURES ARE LIKE A SOLIDS
Line_3216	A FOSS SIGNS SEPAR
Line_3217	NOT SO GOOD
Line_3218	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3219	MAKE THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT THE SAND AND THE WATER DIDN'T
Line_3220	THE WATER IS MIXING WITH GRAPE TASTIC GREAT MIX AND IT'S MIXING
Line_3221	I SAW YOU HAD MOST T
Line_3222	I DON'T KNOW I'M GONNA TO TALK TO YOU
Line_3223	SOLUTE IS THE SALT
Line_3224	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3225	THE SALT IT'S CALLED A
Line_3226	IT IS ALL THE WEIGHT OF THREE OTHER ITEMS TOGETHER
Line_3227	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3228	A A SOLUTE
Line_3229	TOLD YOU BEFORE IT'S A SOLVENT B
Line_3230	BECAUSE THEY ARE A MARTY BECAUSE THEY ARE
Line_3231	GOOD BYE MARNEY I
Line_3232	WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3233	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALAD THE PAPER CLIPS THIS WOOD AND A BE
Line_3234	THE SALAD HAS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE
Line_3235	THEY ARE MIXED UNLIKE THE OTHER PILES
Line_3236	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE SAND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3237	THE REASON THE EMINEMS AND THE NUTS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3238	THEY USED TO BE MIXED ALL TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3239	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND COLORS
Line_3240	YOU SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3241	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE SEPARATE NOW
Line_3242	WIRE YOU ARE FLOATING HEAD ON A PEDISTOL
Line_3243	THE WATER UM IS NOT SEPARATED FROM THE SAND SO THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE THINGS
Line_3244	THEY GOT FILTERS DIDN'T THEY
Line_3245	YOU USED A SPECIAL TYPE OF TOOLS TO FILTER THE SAND FROM THE WATER
Line_3246	THE SALT AND WATER DISSOLVES THE DIRT AND WATER DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS IT'S JUST A MIXTURE
Line_3247	IT'S DISSOLVING SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE SALTY
Line_3248	MAY BE YOU JUST NEED TO I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU WETCHED IN
Line_3249	IT WAS FILTERED BY THAT BLUE FILTERING MASHEIN
Line_3250	THE WATER WILL GET DISSOLVED
Line_3251	NO BECAUSE IT UM MIXED IN WITH THE WATER SO YOU HAVE SO YOU CAN'T
Line_3252	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY TELL ME WE
Line_3253	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODY
Line_3254	YOU SHOW ME YOUR FILE BY PLEAASE
Line_3255	WHY DID YOU PICK ME IN THE MARBLES MARNEY
Line_3256	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND THE SAND MADE THE UM AND THE SAND MADE THE WATER VERY VERY DIERTY
Line_3257	CAN YOU REPEAT MY SENTENCE YOU KICKED ME IN THE BARBIE
Line_3258	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND IT EVAPORATED WHILE THE SAND IT JUST SANK TO THE BOTTOM AND MADE THE WATER DIRTY
Line_3259	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT LIKE THE GRAPE STUFF UM IT LIKE THAT IT'S A THAT AND ABOUT HUNDRED D
Line_3260	THE SALT DISSOLVES UM LIKE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE SAND AND WATER IT LIKE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND MAKES THE WATER ALL DIRTY I HATE YOU FACE BARNEY
Line_3261	THEY'RE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY EQUAL FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3262	THE SALT ADDED WEIGHT TO THE WATER SO NOW IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS RATHER THAN FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3263	THAT IF YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT YOU STILL HAD WEIGHT TO IT DON'T YOU
Line_3264	SOME OF THEM DISSOLVES LIKE THE SALT AND SOME OF THEM DON'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SAND
Line_3265	THEY ALL GOT MIXED TOGETHER SO NOW IT'S A WHOLE MIXTURE
Line_3266	AS IS GETTING LARGER BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING THREE DIFFERENT THING
Line_3267	THE FIFTY GRAMS IS EQUAL TO ONE CUP OF WATER
Line_3268	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME THE ANSWER
Line_3269	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FILTER
Line_3270	THE FLOWER MIXES WITH THE WATER CAN BE FILTERED SO THE WATER AND THE FLOWER CAN BE SEPARATED AGAIN
Line_3271	THAT MEANS THAT IT'S STILL AND A MIXTURE SO THE SALT IS STILL IN THE WATER
Line_3272	THE CITRIC ACID CAN NOT BE FILTERED OUT
Line_3273	AFTER THE DAYS IT'S UM THE WATER DISSOLVED AND THOUGH THEY HAVE THESE SALTS QUIET
Line_3274	THE WATER IS GONE AND THE SALT IS STILL THERE EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T SEE IT IN THE MIXTURE
Line_3275	YOU CAN FILTER OUT THE SALTS FROM THE WATER
Line_3276	THAT OVER TIME THE WATER EVAPORATES AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AND SQUARES NOT CRYSTALS
Line_3277	THAT EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE A SALT AND WATER
Line_3278	IS MY UM FRIEND E FROM VERY IGNERENT OR IS HE NOT HE'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT
Line_3279	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3280	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBBLES SAND WATER
Line_3281	I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS ONE BECAUSE U YOU IT'S A VERY EFICANT WAIT
Line_3282	UH KA MARNIE ARE YOU FAT I'M
Line_3283	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE SAND
Line_3284	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE M MY AS
Line_3285	BEING A MAGNET TO GET ALL THE UM THE PAPER CLIPS OUT SO FROM THE SAND AND SIDE
Line_3286	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE SAND AND WATER
Line_3287	I AM TALKING TO A WOMAN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAST
Line_3288	THIS IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE COR
Line_3289	THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S MAGNET STAYS A

Line_3296	ABOUT HOW EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SOLUTION
Line_3297	IS YOU THAT OR ARE YOU NOT
Line_3298	I FEEL VERY TIRE
Line_3299	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE N SCIENCE MARNEY
Line_3300	U USING A FILTER
Line_3301	ER
Line_3302	ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTES SHINES
Line_3303	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTE
Line_3304	GRAPE TASTIC THAT'S WOULD IT'S COLD
Line_3305	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3306	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3307	THE DARKER ONE HAS THE MOST SOLUTION IN
Line_3308	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN VARALLY SEE THROUGH THE THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM VERY EASILY
Line_3309	YOU PLAY A SONG FOR ME PLEAASE
Line_3310	ONE HAS FIFTY MILLUNITORS OF WATER AND FIVE SPOONFULS AND ONE HAS FIFTY MILLINITORS OF WATER AND ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3311	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE UM FLAVOR HAS A LOT MORE FLAVER IN IT THAN THE ONE SPOON FULL
Line_3312	THE ONE WITH SIX SPOONFULS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THEN THE THAN THE ONE WITH THREE SPOON
Line_3313	IT WOULD TASTE VERY WATERY
Line_3314	IRED TO DO MARNEY
Line_3315	I'M DOING GOOD MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_3316	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING INTERESTING IN SCIENCE
Line_3317	THE GREAT MIX IS PURPLE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS CLEAR THE SALT IS TRA-TRANSPARENT
Line_3318	UH YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_3319	THE FEATHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAMS THE ROCK IS DOING GO DOWN BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3320	IT OTHER WEIGHS LESS THAN THE ROCK
Line_3321	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT MARNEY THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS HEAVIER THAN TE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3322	ONE HAS GRAMS ONE HAS GRAMS SO ONE OF GRAMS WILL BE HEAVIER
Line_3323	THE SALT WATER LOOKS THE SAME AND THE GREAT MIX ARE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_3324	THEY ARE ALL UHM NOT EVEN
Line_3325	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3326	I HATE MARNEY SO MUCH THIN CREEPY P YOU HELP ME WITH SCIENCE SO THANKS

Line_3328	LEARNING ABOUT N CALARMIAN MISTLES
Line_3329	CAR
Line_3330	IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT POWDER ON THE LEFT IS MIXED IN WITH THOUGHT WATER
Line_3331	YOU MIX SOMETHING WITH WASHER THAT MAKES IT SOLAR VIEW
Line_3332	YOU- MIX THE SALT WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3333	THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE SALT SO IT'S SETTLING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_3334	THE EROSION SALT OR EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_3335	SO KIND EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTUM
Line_3336	THE SALT EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM SO THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE
Line_3337	THE WATER IS SATURATED IT CAN HOLD ANYMORE WATER OR SALT
Line_3338	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF E
Line_3339	THE SALT SOLUTION IS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS WHICH SO IT MEANS THE SALT IS SEVENTEEN GRAMS IN THE RE
Line_3340	SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS OF UM SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS IT'S LEVEL WITH THE SOLUTIO
Line_3341	GOOD I FEEL A GREAT MORE YOU BUT NOT
Line_3342	MY OBNOCIOUS FRIENDS JE AND ER KEEP TALKING SO I CAN'T TELL YOU I'M SORRY MARNEY
Line_3343	YOU PUT SHOOGAR CITRIC ACIDS AND EPSOM SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3344	YOU ARE MIXING THE CECTRIC ACID AND LEMROSAM SALT TOGETHER
Line_3345	THE WATER IS SO SATURATED THAT NONE OF NO MORE EPSUM SALT OR CITRIC ACID CAN GO INS
Line_3346	THE SUGAR IS WEIGH WEIGHS MORE THAN THE EPSOM SALT AND THE CITRIC ACID

Line_3371	WHEN YOU PUT SODIUM HOKSIDE AND FIFI FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH HIDROLIC ACID IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_3372	WHAT ARE THE PURPLE ATOMS
Line_3373	TWO OF THEM ARE PURPLE THEY ALL USED TO BE BLUE
Line_3374	YOU CAN DISSOLVE IT YOU PUT IT OUT ON A TRAY AND IT DISSOLVES SO YOU CAN FIND THE AT
Line_3375	IT GOT ALL WATERY ON THE OUTSIDE TOO
Line_3376	YOU HAD CALCIUM CHLORIDE AT THE BOTTOM WHAT HOW DO YOU COULD STICK
Line_3377	THE CARBONATED WATER SO CARBONATED THAT IT IT CAN'T STOP MOVING WITH THE CARBONATION
Line_3378	ITS REACTED BUT IT LIKE FIZZED UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY FAST
Line_3379	THERE IS NO REACTION
Line_3380	IT WENT FROM RAINY TO SNOWY TO DIRTY AND THE COUNTERS FELL OFF
Line_3381	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3382	THE BIKE RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT MEANS IT DOES HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3383	IT'S GLOWING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
Line_3384	WENCE YOU SNAP THE STICK THE STUFF INSIDE IT MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT CAN GLOW
Line_3385	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT TURNS PURPLE BY MARNE
Line_3386	NOT IT'S A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3387	YOU STUCK BARNEY I HATE YOU SO MUCH I
Line_3388	TIRED I REALLY REALLY TIRED
Line_3389	A REACTION DIDN'T ECCUR NO THING FISH HAPPENED
Line_3390	CALCIUM CHORIDE AND THE BAKING SODA HAD A REACTION AND IT MADE IT FILL UP
Line_3391	OH DEAD AND THE SOLID IS A PRODUCT AND A YELLOW
Line_3392	IT'S SIXTY GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_3393	A REACTING PLUS REACTANTS EQUALS THE PRODUCT SO TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE EQUALS SIXTY
Line_3394	THAT THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3395	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN IS FIFTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSE IS SIXTY ONE
Line_3396	BECAUSE THE ONE WET THE BAG UP AND LET THE GASSES OUT
Line_3397	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3398	WELL THERE ARE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE THESE THINGS
Line_3399	THE FIRST PILE IS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE AND THE SECOND PILE IS THREE PILES THAT ARE THE SAME TIPS
Line_3400	WELL ON THE FLUFF PILES THERE ARE UM THE STUFF MIXED TOGETHER THE BEANS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3401	BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT APART INTO EAT INTO GROUPS THAT ARE THE SAME TIP
Line_3402	THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT INTO P PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME
Line_3403	INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED TO WITH THEIR OWN FIND
Line_3404	THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER WHEN THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3405	BEING SEPARATED AND AND THE UM MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WATERS
Line_3406	WELL THOUGH SAND IS A SOLID SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH PAPER SO IT SEE THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_3407	THEY SEPARATED SO NOW THE WATER IS IS UMPURIFIED WHAT IS PURE WATER AND THE DIRT OR THE SAND IS JUST NOW SAND
Line_3408	THE SAND AND WATER ARE BEING SEPARATED AND TO EACH INTO GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN ON
Line_3409	THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER THE SAND THE SAND AND DIRT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3410	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3411	O OKAY UM
Line_3412	THE WATER MAKES THE SALT DISSOLVE AND THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER DECORATE THEN MIX THE UHM SOLUTION
Line_3413	THE THE IT'S BEING THE WATER'S BEING UHM SEPARATED FROM THE DIRT
Line_3414	IT'S A TYPE OF A MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3415	WILL BECOME PART OF THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3416	THE GRAPE ROSE PROBABLY CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3417	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3418	THEY'RE MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MAKES A SOLUTION
Line_3419	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND JUST SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND SAYS THERE
Line_3420	I THINK IT MIGHT BE PLAYING IT MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE GRAPE JU SO THE GRAPE USE MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATE
Line_3421	WELL I THINK THE SALT'S GOING DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THIS ONE
Line_3422	I THINK THE SOLVENT IS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3423	THAT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST ADDING TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS TO FIFTY GRAMS SO THE THE SOLUTION IS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3424	BAALLY JUST ADDING THEM UP
Line_3425	THAT SOLUTE THAT SOLUTION CAN WEIGH MORE THAN THE UM SOLVENT AND THE SOL
Line_3426	THE MASS IS GETTING HEAVIER AND DENSER
Line_3427	IT WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE INDIVIDUAL UM UH COMPONENTS
Line_3428	THAT IS THAT IT ADDS UP
Line_3429	BY FIGURING OUT THE PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE EACH ONE
Line_3430	THAT IT MIXES WITH THE WATER AND IT STAYS IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT ALSO
Line_3431	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE LIQUID WITH THE LIQUID IT'S REALLY IT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE TO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UM SEPAR
Line_3432	IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3433	IT'S EVAPORATING FROM THE WATER E THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_3434	O MAKES A LIQUID WITH UM WITH A SOLID THEN YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT TO TO SEPARATE IT
Line_3435	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S MAKING SALT CRYSTALS AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATED
Line_3436	THAT THEY'RE MIXING THE SALT AND THE WATER AND THAT THE THEN THE WATER IS EVAPORATING IT THE SALT IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS
Line_3437	EN SUNLIGHT AND LIGHT AND HEAT MOSTLY HEAT
Line_3438	HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR TO EVAPORATE THE
Line_3439	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3440	THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING TO MIX ONCE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
Line_3441	IF THERE IS IF THERE IS LIKE YOU YOUR TRYING TO MIKE UM GET A ROCK OUT OF MAGNETI THEN YOU COULD USE A MAGNET TO GET MAGNETITE
Line_3442	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE ROCKS OR THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATERS
Line_3443	THAT THE ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FRESHENING UP THE WATER
Line_3444	THE ROCKS STANDS TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH TO THE OTHER CUP
Line_3445	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE W THE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGH AND THE THE PEBBLES ARE STANDING ON TOP
Line_3446	THAT THE MAGNE- THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE SAFETY PENS
Line_3447	UH WELL FOR THIS ONE WE'RE USING MAGNETIGHS TO SEPARATE HIM
Line_3448	A SALL A SAL AND A SOLUTE
Line_3449	I N GET SOMETHING WITH MAGNETITE AN WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT
Line_3450	THAT THE ROCK SAY ON TOP OR THE PEBBLE STAYED ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3451	BECAUSE BECAUSE A PARTICLE SIZED TO GET THE ROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER THROUGH
Line_3452	THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE SOCK THE LITTLE TINY PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT SO
Line_3453	BECAUSE THE LITTLE PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH ITS
Line_3454	THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE THE THE SAND THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE BUT THE SALT WOULD STAY THERE
Line_3455	THAT THAT THE UM SCENT THE SALTS WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY
Line_3456	WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOOLS A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLLUTE THAN SOLVENTS
Line_3457	JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HEARD YOU SAY SOLUTION
Line_3458	MIXTURES ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER
Line_3459	BI USING WATER EVAPORATION AND MAYBE MAGNETISM
Line_3460	THREE THE PERSONS USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PENS OUT
Line_3461	THEY'RE USING A SCREEN SORTION THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3462	THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCK STAY ON TOP OF IT SEPARATE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3463	ROCKS AND THE WATER GETS SEPARATED AND THE WATER GOES DOWN BUT THE ROCKS STAND ON TOP
Line_3464	BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLES SIZE SO THAT THE ROCKS
Line_3465	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE MAGNET THE MAGNET THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT YOU USE A MAGNET
Line_3466	BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT TOOLS CAN HELP WITH DIFFERENT PROBLOMS IN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3467	GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET
Line_3468	I NOTICE THAT THE ROCK ST ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM THE ALL THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SEE
Line_3469	BECAUSE THE ROCKS CAN GET THROUGH THE SEED BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN
Line_3470	I I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3471	THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH THE FEE FILTER BUT THE UM SAND CAN
Line_3472	MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALTS WILL STAY THEY THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND MAKE LITTLE CRYSTAL
Line_3473	I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE
Line_3474	WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TOOLS HELPS WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES BYE
Line_3475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES OF SOLUTIONS
Line_3476	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3477	CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT
Line_3478	THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_3479	THE LEFT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3480	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3481	THEY GET SEPARATED
Line_3482	THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY WERE BEFORE
Line_3483	THE WATER LEAKED THROUGH THE THING AND THE MARBLE STAINED ON TOP
Line_3484	THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND THE MARBLES DIDN'T
Line_3485	THE MARBLES STAYED
Line_3486	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE SALT DISAPPEARS IN WATER
Line_3487	THE SALT DISAPPEARS
Line_3488	IT DISAPPEARES THE
Line_3489	AT
Line_3490	I I AM SO GOOD
Line_3491	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3492	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3493	Y SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE WATER
Line_3494	LE BLOB LEAR LEG ON'T EVERY KNOB
Line_3495	THE PILES ON THE LEFT IS SEPARATED
Line_3496	THE RIGHT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3497	-MIXTURES
Line_3498	BECAUSE THE
Line_3499	THEY'RE SEPARATED- ALL OF THE
Line_3500	THE CANDY THE PEANUTS AND THE RAISINS ARE ALL IN SEPARATE PILES NOW
Line_3501	THEY'RE SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_3502	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SHIFTS AND THE MARBLES DID NOT
Line_3503	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENILENT WAY
Line_3504	THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER CAME OUT CLEAR
Line_3505	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3506	ONE EXAMPLE IS SHIOOGER INTO THE AND SALT INTO WATER AND WHEN SOMETHING DISSOLVES IT USUALLY COMES BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3507	IF YOU JUST PUT IF YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT WON'T DISSOLVE
Line_3508	SOLUTIONS
Line_3509	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S
Line_3510	IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET BACK BUT IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE
Line_3511	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEPARATING A SOLUTIONS
Line_3512	THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
Line_3513	AL MIXTURE
Line_3514	THE SAND IS A SOLUTION AND THE SALT ISN'T
Line_3515	I BELIEVE THE ROLE THE WATER PLANE IS A SOLUTE
Line_3516	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3517	IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3518	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS A SOLVENT
Line_3519	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3520	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLAS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3521	WHEN YOU ADD THE MASSES TOGETHER THEY EQUAL THE RESULT
Line_3522	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE UM MASS OF A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION YOU GET THE SENDING M
Line_3523	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3524	NO MASS IS LOSE OR GAINED IN HIS PROCESS
Line_3525	IT IT THE WEIGHT IS CONSERVED
Line_3526	COINSTORRATION OF MASS
Line_3527	Y YOU CAN DO THAT IN A MIXTURE
Line_3528	THE SALT STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3529	IT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE WHEN WE STARTED
Line_3530	THE CITRIC ACID STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER FILTERED THROUGH
Line_3531	IT'S ACTUALLY A SOLUTION
Line_3532	YOU MIGHT USE EVRAPPORATION
Line_3533	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT CRYSTALS BEHIND
Line_3534	THE EVAPORATION THEN WELL WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES UP INTO THE SKY
Line_3535	IT GOES UP INTO THE SKY
Line_3536	TIMES PASSING
Line_3537	I'M WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
Line_3538	EVAPORATION IS ONE WAY TO SEPARATE MIXTURE FROM A
Line_3539	THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3540	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETTING EXTRACTED FROM THE DRY MIXTURES BY THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3541	MIX THE MIXTURES ARE MIX
Line_3542	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3543	YOU PUT ONE LIQUID INTO ANOTHER SOLID A
Line_3544	ONE WATER MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3545	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SOLUTIONS IN IT
Line_3546	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS A DARKER COLOR
Line_3547	THERE IS MORE POWDER IN THE GRBLASS ON THE LEFT RIGHT I MEAN HIM
Line_3548	THE MASS OF THE CONCENTRATED WATERS
Line_3549	THE COLOR AND THE MASS
Line_3550	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE REST
Line_3551	BECAUSE THE LIGHTER COLORS HAS HAVE A LESS CONCENTRATION IN THEM
Line_3552	MORE SHOOGEEARY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3553	IT HAS LESS FLAVORING IN IT
Line_3554	MY ADDING WATER
Line_3555	YOU TAKE A AWAY FROM THE SOLUTION
Line_3556	YOU TAKE AWAY SOME SOLUTIONS
Line_3557	BIMMARNAY
Line_3558	MAY I'M DON OKIE
Line_3559	SO TODAY WE WORKED ON HOW CONCENTRATED THINGS MIGHT BE LIKE HOW CONCENTRATED FRUITS PUNCH MIGHT BE
Line_3560	THE CORK IS MORE DENSE THAN THE PENNY
Line_3561	IT WILL FLOAT
Line_3562	IT THINKS
Line_3563	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOW CONCENTRATED WATER CAN GET WHEN YOU ADD CONCENTRATED POWDER
Line_3564	THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_3565	BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT JUST IT STAYS TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS SEVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED
Line_3566	THE LAST GRAPE DRINK MIX IS THE MORE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3567	YOU WEIGH THE N
Line_3568	NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_3569	NUMBER BEAR I GUESS
Line_3570	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3571	WELL A MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3572	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY A AND THAT'S WHY THE WATER IS CARRYING
Line_3573	AN OBJECT THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW INSTEAD OF SINK
Line_3574	IT'LL FLOW
Line_3575	IT'LL SINK I MARNEY
Line_3576	LL SOLUTION A WILL BE MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION
Line_3577	IF THE LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT'S MORE LIKELY WHEN YOU DROP SOMETHING IN IT WILL FLOW
Line_3578	SOLUTION B IS MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION A BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SALT INTO WATER THE SALT WON'T ALWAYS DISSOL
Line_3579	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3580	SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE SO IT WILL RISE TO THE TOP
Line_3581	THE LESS ENDS WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE DENSE LE SEE TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3582	IT I'LL LAYER ON ON THE VERY TOP
Line_3583	ONES PUT SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM AND SOLUTION B ON THE TOP
Line_3584	BECAUSE IT'S ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE IN CORRECT ORDER THEY'LL SINK I MEAN THEY'D MIX
Line_3585	GOT LOUD
Line_3586	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION AND LIQUIDS
Line_3587	THE SHGGER IS THE MOST SATURATED AND UM IN KILL MASON RIGHT NOW
Line_3588	TWELVE GRAM IS I MEAN SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3589	WHEN YOU EVAPORATE THE CITRIC ACID EPSOM SALT AND REGULAR SALT THE CRYSTALS MANY FORM DIFFERENT PATTERNS
Line_3590	GOOD BYE OH IT'S DING AND IT'S ONE FIFTY IVE GOT TO GO BYE
Line_3591	THEY ARE SOLIDS
Line_3592	WATER AND MARBLES WATER IS A SALT IS A LIQUID AND MARBLES ARE A SALT
Line_3593	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3594	MARNEY THEY SEPARATE HER NAMES MARNEY MIX THERE BUT IT'S MARNEY THEY SEPARATE
Line_3595	THEY SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT PIECES
Line_3596	THE M SAY ON A STRAINER AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3597	WELL THE MARBLES ARE ON TOP THE STRAINER AND THE WATER RUNG THROUGH
Line_3598	THE SAND GOT CAUGHT IN THE SEPARATORS AND THE WATER WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH T
Line_3599	THE SALT MIXES TOGETHER WHEREAS THE PAPER CLIPS AND WHICH CLIPS TURN P
Line_3600	NO BECAUSE THIS M GRAPE PLASTIC DUST IS
Line_3601	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTI
Line_3602	THEY ARE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TO MAKE IT S
Line_3603	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVE
Line_3604	A SOLUTE SALT WATER
Line_3605	SHE'S GONE A SOLUTION
Line_3606	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3607	IT IS WATER AND IT HELPS THE SALT THE S
Line_3608	THE SALT AND THE WATER IS MIXED TOGETHER INCREASING THE MASS OF THE SALT AND WATER
Line_3609	WHEN THE SALT WHICH IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WHICH IS FIFTY GRAMS ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3610	YOU USE DIFFERENT MATERIALS BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPERTIES OF THE THINGS HAVE E
Line_3611	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THE WATER WENT COMPLETELY THROUGH
Line_3612	THE SOLUTE IS A MIXTURE
Line_3613	THEY HAVE NO MIX THE WE'VE NO MIXTURE IN THE SOLUTION
Line_3614	HE USES THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES TURN ADVANTAGE
Line_3615	THE WATER AND THE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS DISSOLVED
Line_3616	IT HELPS SEPARATE THE DISSOLVED ITUMS FROM THE SOLUTE SO THE SOLVENT
Line_3617	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO GET THE ICE CRYSTAL STACKS
Line_3618	THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN
Line_3619	THE WATER EVAPORATES AND THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LESS
Line_3620	THE SUNLIGHT
Line_3621	YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE SOLID FROM THE SOLVENT AND A SOLUTION UNLESS YOU EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_3622	ONE HAS MORE CONCENTRATION THAN THE ONE
Line_3623	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT MARNEY
Line_3624	THE DARKER THE COLOR THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3625	THE DARKER HAS MORE POWDER AND THE LIGHTER HAS LESS POWDER OR M
Line_3626	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3627	THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_3628	BIT HAS MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER
Line_3629	ONE HAS MORE GREAT THE ONE THAT HAS MORE GREAT POWER IS TASTE MORE LIKE UM TASTE MORE LIKE GRAPE
Line_3630	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE LIKE WATER THAN THE GREAT FLAYVORING
Line_3631	IT TEST WHAT UNLIKE WATER ST
Line_3632	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER BUT KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT GRAPE TASTIC STUFF
Line_3633	T BY ADDING MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_3634	WE ARE FINDING MISTORRY A T MISTOR SO
Line_3635	IT IS SALT AND WATER MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3636	IT IS SATURATED FULLY SATURATED
Line_3637	THE MORE SALT YOU ADD THE MORE WATER LIKE THE HIGHER THE WATER GET
Line_3638	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER CANNOT HOLD ANY MORE SALT
Line_3639	AFTER THREE SCHOOL SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED AND NO MORE SALT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_3640	THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED WHICH MEANS NO MORE IT CAN HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3641	THE SOLUTION IS NO LONGER SOLUABLE
Line_3642	THE SHOOGER IS MORE SOLUABLE THAN THE EPSOM SALT WHICH MEANS MORE SHOOGER CAN DISSOLVE IN THE W
Line_3643	IT'S NO LONGER SOLUABLE
Line_3644	THE SALT ADDS MORE MASS
Line_3645	IT TOOK FOUR SCOOPS FOR THE WATER TO COMPLETE BE COMPLETELY SOLID SALT SATURATED WITH THE CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS TO BEGIN
Line_3646	SHOOKGER IS SIX SCOOPS MORE SOLUABLE I MEAN TWO SCOOPS MORE SOLUABLE THAN CITRIC
Line_3647	SHOOGAR IS TWO MORE SCOOPS SOLUBLE THAN FOR THEM CITRIC ACID
Line_3648	SOME DISSOLVE MORE IN CLA- MORE IN WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE SOLUTAB
Line_3649	THE WATER GAINS MASS BECAUSE OF THE SALT THAT IS GOING INTO
Line_3650	CITRIC ACID IS THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM EPSOM SALT IS THE ONE ON THE TOP LEFT AND SALT IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3651	I THINK IT IS EPSOM SAL
Line_3652	I THINK THEY ARE MADE OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3653	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AND THEN THE TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES MIXED TOGETHER D CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CALLES SALT
Line_3654	THE SOLUTE MADE THE REACTION REACT
Line_3655	DE SOLUTION IN THE BAG CAUSED A REACTION THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS THE L OR CARBON DYIOCIDE IN THE BAG
Line_3656	IN THE BAKING SODA AND THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE THE BAKING SODA HI IS DENSER THAN THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3657	I SEE WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3658	THE MOLECULES TOOK AND RE ARRANGED THEMSELVES TO CREATE A NEW PRODUCT
Line_3659	MMM OH CAN WE
Line_3660	A REALLY BAD A REALLY BAD SALADS

Line_3670	JAY IT'S GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL D BECAUSE I'VE GOT IN THE SHOWER PERSON
Line_3671	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT MORNINGS
Line_3672	WHEN YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER IT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3673	YEAH HO
Line_3674	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3675	THE SALT IS THE SALT DIS
Line_3676	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CAUSE IT DISAPPEARS DISSOLVING MEANS DISAPPEARING

Line_3684	WHY SHOULD I YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A COMPUTER PROGRAM YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING CREA
Line_3685	YOU ACTUALLY SPOKEN TORE YOU LITTLE A
Line_3686	THE SALT IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND IT'S CALLED DEL DROP IT DISSOLVE
Line_3687	UHM YOU'RE CREEPY
Line_3688	ADD THE GRAPE TO THE WATER MARNEY UM NOT STUPID
Line_3689	YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT ROSE
Line_3690	CAT'S SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A PACK OF EGGS

Line_3700	MEAN THAT
Line_3701	MAGNETISMS I SAID THAT ALREADY DASH
Line_3702	BREAK THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3703	CAUSE YOU CAN USE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER AND THEN JAR MARNEY
Line_3704	YOU USE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE THE PAPER CLI
Line_3705	BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIPS ARE MADE OF METAL AND THE MAGNETS PICK UP MET
Line_3706	I I DON'T CARE
Line_3707	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_3708	BECAUSE THE FILTER ONLY LET'S WATER COME THROUGH IT AND NOT GRAVEL

Line_3729	GOOD KATE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A GIRL FRIEND OBVIOUSLY AND YOU'RE STILL WEAR
Line_3730	WE WERE DOING WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT RAIMBOWS IN A TOB
Line_3731	SHOW ME AN ATOMS
Line_3732	THE
Line_3733	I DON'T KNOW WELL YOU'RE HERE WELL ACTUALLY THE PENNY IS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK WHICH MAKES THE CORK FLOW SO THE PENNY SINK
Line_3734	THE THE SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3735	ONES WOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3736	MRS KATE GOOD MORNING HOW A YOU DO WHEN THE DAY I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU HAT STUFF YOUR PROGRAM
Line_3737	WE WISH YOU WE'LL MARRY CRISMAUS
Line_3738	IT SAY YOU SHOULD JUMP INTO THAT CUP AND DROWN YOURSELF YOU'RE UGLY
Line_3739	THEY FLOW TO THE TOP AND THE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION B SINKS TO THE BOTT
Line_3740	CA THE LESS CONE CONSTANT CONENTRATED
Line_3741	I'M A FIFTEEN YEARS OLD GIRL IN SIBER
Line_3742	IT WILL FLING TO THE TOP
Line_3743	THEY ALL MIX SO NOW IT'S ONE BIG SOLUTIONS BE
Line_3744	A MORE DENSE SOLUTIONS
Line_3745	REPEAT REP
Line_3746	OKAY BYE WALKS OFF
Line_3747	A HAVE YOU ARE FOKS ON SILENCE
Line_3748	S REPEATED
Line_3749	WOULD YOU REPEAT THAT MAGNET NO MY ITIOTIC FOR
Line_3750	USE THEY ARE LEARNING ON DISSOLVING OH UH THE MOONS THERE IS COMING FOR HIM
Line_3751	YOU'RE DISSOLVING IT
Line_3752	MARNEY SEE I'M SORRY HAVE MY FRIEND COMPLAIN WHAT IS YOUR AL
Line_3753	MILLILITERS WAIT IS BEING IT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT ALSO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT THE STILL SALT PARTICLES LIT
Line_3754	YOU'RE TRYING TO ME
Line_3755	YOU HAVE TO MIX A SALT SOLUTION WITH THE FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER DA MARNEY YOU INTERRUPTED MY S
Line_3756	KATE DIED KATE'S DOING AND I YOU HAVEN'T E IT OERIOUSLY STOP US YOU'VE GOT IT YOU H
Line_3757	THE SHOOGAR WEIGHS MORE THAN THE CITRIC ACID AND THE S
Line_3758	I DON'T KNOW THE MASS OF THE WEIGHTS IT ALWAYS N IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS
Line_3759	IT'S SALT
Line_3760	I CAN DO THE CECTRIC ACID I SWEARE TO GOD
Line_3761	THE CHEMICALS OF BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED AND IT CREATED A CHEMICAL THAT MADE A REACTION TO MAKE IT FIZ
Line_3762	A REACTION CALLED OR SOLUTION
Line_3763	A SOLUTIONS I SAID THAT
Line_3764	MIXTURES OF OF CINULL HELP ME OUT HERE
Line_3765	AIRE IS INSIDE THE BAG AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR YOU HARDLY CAN SEE IT
Line_3766	THEY'RE DO STUFF MIX TOGETHER BUT THEY KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3767	CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NO W
Line_3768	AN WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3769	IT'S A MIXTURE AND THE THINK UH
Line_3770	ACTUALLY WE WRACTUALY LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND NOT
Line_3771	WELL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_3772	SO THE SAND IS GOING INTO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS GOING INTO THE TO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS DISSOLVING
Line_3773	THE SALT UM DISSOLVED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SALT IS A DISSOLVING MATERIAL
Line_3774	THE WATER IS PLAIN IN THE RIP IT'S THE GREAT TASTIC THING IS PLAIN THE SALT
Line_3775	UM NAMED FOR THE WILT IS A SOLVENT
Line_3776	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3777	WE CALL THAT THE SOLVENT
Line_3778	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PLUS THE WATER WITH SALT IT BECOMES SALT WATER AND SALT WATER WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN
Line_3779	IT TELLS ME THAT ALL THE S THE WEIGHTS STAYS THE SAME IN THE PROPERTY STAR
Line_3780	THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD UM MATERIALS TOGETHER UM YOU ARE THE PRODUCT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAM
Line_3781	IT'S NOT THE SAME UH LE OKAY LAM YOU ARE SO
Line_3782	THE MASS UH INCREASES BY FIFTEEN
Line_3783	THAT IT IS A CORRECT ADDITION PROBLEM
Line_3784	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_3785	THIS MEANS THAT THE SAND T I MEAN THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3786	IT IS CONSIDERED A A SOLUTION
Line_3787	IT'S ACTUALLY A A MIXTURE
Line_3788	YOU CAN ONLY GET IT OUT IN A MIXTURE OR YOU CAN DO IT A SOLUTION IF IF IT'S LIKE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT
Line_3789	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
Line_3790	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3791	IT'S EVAPORATING SO YOU CAN SEE THE SALT THE SALT IT'S STILL THERE
Line_3792	IT IS EVAPORATING I TOLD YOU SEVERAL TIMES
Line_3793	Y YOU COULD EVAPORATE IT INSTEAD
Line_3794	BYE YOU HAVE A NICE TIE
Line_3795	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_3796	WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE BY USING MAGNETISM
Line_3797	Y YOU COULD USE DENSITY MAGNETISM
Line_3798	WELL THE MIXTURE IS WITH GRAVEL AND WATER BUT WHEN YOU POUR IT THROUGH A SCREEN ONLY THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE GRAVEL STAYS ON THE SCRE
Line_3799	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE PROPERLY SIZED OF WATER
Line_3800	THE IMPORIUM PROPERTY IS PRICAL SIZE
Line_3801	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_3802	IT WAS PORITICAL SIZE DISSALED VERITATION AND MAGNETISM
Line_3803	P PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3804	BECAUSE THEY'RE A SOLIDS
Line_3805	BE BECAUSE WATER WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE THING AND ONLY THE PAPER CLIPS WOULD STICK TO THAT SO THAT'S YOUR EXLENT WAY TO SEPARATED
Line_3806	BECAUSE ALL MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_3807	BECAUSE MAGNETS HAS MAGNETISM AND IT'S PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_3808	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIGGER SIZE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3809	BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES CAN GO THROUGH BUT THE BIG ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3810	UP WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE COULD USE IT WITH THE SCREEN I DON'T KNOW WAIT NO
Line_3811	CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
Line_3812	THAT YOU'RE SEPARATING THE M
Line_3813	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3814	BRING UM MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS EVE YEAH
Line_3815	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING A SALT SOLUTION
Line_3816	YOU'RE USING GREAT USE UM AND THERE IS ONES MORE CONCENTRATED AND ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3817	YOU CAN TELL BY WEIGHING IN THAT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATOR OR ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATE
Line_3818	UM YOU CAN DETERMINE THE BY WHICH IS MORE MORE CONCENTRATED AND WHICH IS MORE DILUTE
Line_3819	ONE HAS MORE POWERED AND ONE HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3820	THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGHTER COLORS AND THE LIGHTER CARORS ARE MORE DILUTE
Line_3821	THE WITH LESS GRA POWER WOULD TASTE OF BORING AND THE ONE WITH MORE WOULD TASTE MORE GRAPIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE GRIP TASTIC
Line_3822	IT WOULD TASTE A MORE WATERY
Line_3823	IT'S DIFFERENT CAUSE ONE IS MORE STRONGER AND IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAT MAKES IT STRONG AND THE ONE THAT'S MORE DILUTED IS NOT STRONG
Line_3824	I'M GOOD
Line_3825	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3826	WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT S
Line_3827	WELL ONE CAN BE A SATURATED
Line_3828	ONE GETS SATURATED FASTER
Line_3829	THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I JUST SAID
Line_3830	UM KIND OF ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT
Line_3831	THEY'RE TRYING TO SATURATE
Line_3832	BY SEEING HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SATURATE
Line_3833	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN
Line_3834	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN I THINK IT'S SALT THOUGHT
Line_3835	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHER AGAIN PLEASE
Line_3836	WELL YOU CAN I MEAN APORATEUR AND THEN
Line_3837	ES PUMP SALT
Line_3838	WE'VE BEEN DOING CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CORD AND BAKING SODA WITH A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3839	THAT'S CALLED CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3840	TWO SIGHT A SOLID
Line_3841	THAT THOSE TWO THINGS MAKES SALT
Line_3842	WE MIXED TWO SOLUTES TOGETHER AND THEN PUT THEM IN A SOLVENT AND THEY MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3843	THOSE TWO CHEMICALS MAKES WHATEVER THAT WELL THEY MIX TOGETHER AND THEN UH
Line_3844	IT'S A CHEMICAL REACT SHARDEN
Line_3845	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_3846	THAT ONE IS GREATER ONES LESS IS WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER HAND ARE ON TWO OR POINT TWO
Line_3847	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPENED LET OUT GASES AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED CONCEALED THE GAS
Line_3848	LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3849	THERE IS A SALAD MARBLES TRAIL MIX PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD
Line_3850	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED TOGETHER WITH ALL THREE THINGS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATE
Line_3851	THEY GET SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WOULD
Line_3852	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM A MIXTURE
Line_3853	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE WAT
Line_3854	THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3855	WE MADE A SOLUTION BY USING A FILTER AND THE FILTERS SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3856	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER MIX
Line_3857	IN THE SALT SEPARATE E NEVERMIND
Line_3858	THAT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT MIX MIXES INTO THE WATER AND THEY BECOME ONE JUST SALT W
Line_3859	THE SALT DISAPPEARS THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE TO FORM TO FORM THE OPTION
Line_3860	BECAUSE THE SALT AND THE GREAT TASTIC UM MIXED WITH EACH OTHER MADE L
Line_3861	WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT IT MARNIE
Line_3862	IT'S A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING COMING TOW
Line_3863	THAT'S A MIXTURE AND THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3864	THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT'S TO
Line_3865	THE GRAB SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE MAR
Line_3866	THE COFFY FILTER HELD THE SAND BUT LET GO THE WAX
Line_3867	THE FILTER STOPS THE SAND
Line_3868	THE WOMEN AT MARNEY PLEASE LIVE YOU BEAR
Line_3869	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE REST ARE A
Line_3870	THE SALT DISAPPEARED IN THE WATER AND ITS A SOLUTION
Line_3871	IT ACTS A SOLUTION OKAY PUT THE HEAD OH WE'RE DONE
Line_3872	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY I GOT WHAT ADDOM DID IS HE JUST KEPT SAYING I WOULD DO HE HOLE THING
Line_3873	THE DIFFERENCE FROM A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION I
Line_3874	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUT
Line_3875	THE WATER PLUS THE SAND EQUALS SAND WATER AND THEN THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT
Line_3876	WHAT'S A MIXTURE AND WAS SOLUTIO
Line_3877	THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS JUST IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEN THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTE
Line_3878	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER WHICH IS A SOL
Line_3879	THE GREAT TA STICK IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER SO THE WATER LE WATER IS DISSOLVENT
Line_3880	THE SALT IS A SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS TO SOLVENT
Line_3881	THAT GRAM FLOWE GRAMS EQUALS GR
Line_3882	CANDYPUSS REASONS FOR PEANUTS EQUALS A MIXTURE OF FIFTY GR
Line_3883	THREE CUBES PLUS WATER EQUALS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MASS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME HEAVYNESS
Line_3884	GRAMS UH GRAMS ICLES GRAMS
Line_3885	THAT WATER PUT FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT
Line_3886	USING A COPY FILTER
Line_3887	THAT MEANS IT'S A MIXTURE MARNIE
Line_3888	A MIX A SOLUTE
Line_3889	YOU'RE MIXING SALT AND WATER TO GET A SOLUTION
Line_3890	THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT STAINED THE SAME AND MADE IT
Line_3891	USE A PEACHERY DISH TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THE SALT TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THE WATER JUST B
Line_3892	THE SALT IS LEFT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE S
Line_3893	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT JUST STAYED ON THE PEACHYRY DISH BECAUSE IT'S A SOLID AND NOT A
Line_3894	WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURE OR SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SEPAR
Line_3895	BIE
Line_3896	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3897	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUT IT TOGETHER
Line_3898	YOU 'RE FILTERING THE ROCKS OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3899	SO THAT YOU COULD GET THE A SOLID OUT FROM THE LIQUID
Line_3900	A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTE
Line_3901	TO GET THE PEBBLES OUT OF THE SAND WATERS
Line_3902	BECAUSE THEY A MAGNET ATTRACTS OTHER METAL THINGS TO ATTACH TO IT
Line_3903	TO SEPARATE SOLIDS FROM LIQU
Line_3904	YOU FILTER TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS OMA STUCK TO THE WATER TO GET OUT WITH THE FILL
Line_3905	WE USE THE FILTER TO SEPARATE IT'S SALT UH SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SMALL FROM THE WATER TO THE
Line_3906	THE LAST ONE IS THE BEST TO MAKE CARS
Line_3907	BYE BYE BYE SEE YOU BYE
Line_3908	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3909	YOU CAN GET SALT AND WATER AND THEN MIX THEM AND IT'LL ALMOST LOOK LIKE THE SALT DISAPPEARED BUT IT DIDN'T
Line_3910	IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3911	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTE THAN THE
Line_3912	THERE IS MORE SWITCH IN ONE THAN THE
Line_3913	A GRADUATED SILENDER
Line_3914	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3915	YOU CAN TELL BY WEIGHING IT FROM THAT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE O
Line_3916	THAT ONE IS HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTH
Line_3917	THAT ONE HAS NO
Line_3918	UH THIS KI EATERS IS ALFULLY HUGE
Line_3919	I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH A BAG
Line_3920	THE ROCK HAS MORE MASS THAN THE FEATHER SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3921	ONE IS MORE BY LOUD THAN THE OTHER
Line_3922	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTION THAN THE OTH
Line_3923	ITS WOULD BALANCE OUT THE SAME
Line_3924	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE O
Line_3925	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ONCE EACH ONE IS DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3926	THREE AND TWO ARE THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THEY
Line_3927	NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3928	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBERS THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3929	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED UMBER THREE IS THE MOST DILUTE
Line_3930	THAT MEANS IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE HEAVIER SOLUTION
Line_3931	THEY BOTH HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOL
Line_3932	BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS HEAVIER THAN SOLUTION A
Line_3933	YOU CAN TELL BY HOW DENSE EACH ONE IS TWELVE IS TWELVE L
Line_3934	THE DENSER ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BLUE CAN HOLD UP THE GREEN AND THE
Line_3935	YOU ARE MIXING UH MORE GREAP SO GREAP IT WITH WATER
Line_3936	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS FIVE OF EM FIVE OF EM
Line_3937	WE WEIGHED T
Line_3938	YOU WEIGHED IT AND THE ONE WITH THE WITH UM MOE IS CONCENTRATED IT THINK
Line_3939	UM HOW MUCH THE SPOONS E HOW MUCH THE SPOONFULS YOU HAVE
Line_3940	THEY TASTE GOOD
Line_3941	I DON'T KNOW OKAY
Line_3942	THE LEFT HAS LESS
Line_3943	BETTER THAN THE BRIGHT
Line_3944	AMOUNTS WO CAUSE IT IS LIKE WATERS OKAY
Line_3945	IT WON'T TASTE THAT GOOD
Line_3946	YOU CAN TAKE THE WATER OUT
Line_3947	TEREES PLEASE CAN JUST MOVE ON
Line_3948	THE MOON SUN AND PLANETS
Line_3949	HALF OF THE EARTH IS IN THE DAY OR THE LIGHT AND HALF THE EARTH IS IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS DARKER
Line_3950	IT'S SIMILAR TO THE EARTH ROTATING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3951	THE SUNS ROTATING
Line_3952	THE AXIS THAT THE EARTH IS ROTATING ON
Line_3953	IT'S MORNING IN THE WEST AND NIGHT AND THE WEST
Line_3954	THE SUN IN THE EARTH AND NORTH- AMERICA
Line_3955	THE EARTH IS SPINNING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3956	THE ESTIMATION SHOWS ME THAT THE EARTH IS ACTUALLY MOVING AROUND THE SUN INSTEAD OF THE SUN MOVING AROUND THE EARTH
Line_3957	IT'S THE SAME ANIMATION BUT IT'S MOVED IN A DIFFERENT SPOT T
Line_3958	A YEAR GOES BY WHEN THE WHEN THE EARTH MOVES ALL WAY AROUND THE SUN TO THE SAME SPOT IT WAS IN
Line_3959	IT COLORS A SISTOM AS WEAELS A CHAIR AND ENGENS AND AND OTHER STUFF
Line_3960	THE ENDREN IS CONNECTED TO THE WEAL SO THE WEALS WILL MOVE THE CAR AND DISCONNECTED TO THE
Line_3961	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKE IT MOVED LIKE THE WEALES N AXLE AND EXHAUST AND THE INFANT
Line_3962	THE WEALE AS THE IN A NOW SAYING AND THE END MIX THE WEALS MOVES TO THE CARBON MOVE AND DRIVE
Line_3963	A HUMAN IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS A WHOLE SUBSYSTEMS LIKE THE LUNGS OR THE INTESTMENTS THE CAN
Line_3964	IT SHOWS UM LESS SUBSISTING S IT SHOWS UM LESS UBSISTOMS AND THE BAG SISTM
Line_3965	ALL THE BLOOD VAINS
Line_3966	THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS A BIG SYSTEM WITH A WHOLE TUNDRA SUB SISTUMS
Line_3967	A TRAIN
Line_3968	TH IS A BIG SUB SISTM AND IT HAS A WHOLE TRY MOVING PART
Line_3969	WELL THE EARTH IS A BIG UM WITH THE WHOLE METER OF THINGS LIKE THE BILE SPEER AND THE ATMSFEERE AND OTHER FER
Line_3970	YES HAS HIBATRICISTOMS LIKE THE BUL SPEER THE ATMAS FER AS CARS COMPETORS US
Line_3971	UH WE'RE SUP CISTOMS ON TOP THE BIG CISTON ER TH
Line_3972	THESE SUB CISTOMS ARE PART OF THE EARTH
Line_3973	FOR OF THEM ONE OF THEMS CALLED THE ATMSFEER AND THE OTHER Y'S CA THERE IS ANOTHER ONE CALLED THE BOTTLE SPEER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE COLD YEAH YEA
Line_3974	H THE WATER AND THE FISH THERE ARE THE CORRAL AND ALL THE ORGANISMS LIVE DOWN IN THE SE
Line_3975	H SPARKS MILLY MADE UP OF WATER
Line_3976	JOINS IN THE FORCE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3977	THE THE DESERT HAS DIFFERENT ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND THE ARIEAS HAVE FIX CORAL AND OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_3978	I THINK IT GETS MADE UP OF ANIMALS AND OTHER WATERS STUFF
Line_3979	THE ECO SYSTEM IS THE BIG THING AND THE BUBBLE SPIRIT IS SUBSYST
Line_3980	IT'S A FOOD TRAIN OF ALL THE FOODS YEAH
Line_3981	IT'S A FLOODS LIKE Y
Line_3982	THAT'S THEY ALL MIXED UP TOGETHER SOME HOW
Line_3983	THEY'RE ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE FOR THEY GO ALL AROUND THE CYCLE UNTIL THEY COME BACK TO POINTY
Line_3984	IT CROSS ALL THE ANIMALS EAT TO DO ALL WEIGH UNTIL THEY GET BACK TO THE END TILL THEY CAN START
Line_3985	ACHING UP TOGETHER SOLTION AND THAT'S TO TILE HAVE EACH OTHER AND CLECT EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER DON'T GETS BACK TO
Line_3986	THAT THEY WOULD ALL MATCH UP AND BE ABLE EAT EACH E
Line_3987	THEY ONLY HARE LIVING ORGANISMS
Line_3988	DOING IT I'M DON'T PA
Line_3989	WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3990	WE WERE SEEING IF YOU LIKED FLOWER OR SHOUGER MORE
Line_3991	I THINK THIS SHOWS LIKE UM HOW EAST RELEASES THE GAS AS IT EAT
Line_3992	IT'S SHOWING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT ONE EAST EATS ONE EAST TO EAT
Line_3993	THAT YEAST IS SINGLES SETTLED AND DOESN'T HAVE A MOUTH OR ANY THING
Line_3994	WE WE'RE GROWING WEIGHT TO SEE HOW IT HOW IT IS AFFECTED BY HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAS S
Line_3995	ONE WAS NOT PUT INTO LIGHT SO I DIDN'T GET THE SAME NEW DRIAMS AS THE HEALTHY ONE
Line_3996	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PLAN WHAT IT NEEDS TO GROW AND HOW IT GROWS
Line_3997	THE PICTURE SHOWS IN SOIL LIGHT AND WATER
Line_3998	I THINK THIS PLANT DOES BECAUSE MOST PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3999	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED OCCIGEN OR SOME FORM OF AIR TO SURVIVE E
Line_4000	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME MIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4001	THINK THIS SHOWS THAT THE PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF FOOD TORE MAYBE SOME FORM OF NUTRIENTS
Line_4002	THAT THEY IN A WEIGHT IS LIQUID SO IT CAN MOVE THROUGHOUT THE SELLS
Line_4003	IT SHOWS AT HOME THAT PLANTS DO NECESSARILY NEED A HOME
Line_4004	THEY COLLECT S AND THEY TRANS FOR THAT AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHOOGAR WHICH THEY PRESS THROUGH THE SELLS THIS IS CUTE CINTHECIS
Line_4005	THIS MAYBE SHOWS THAT THEY PLANT DIDN'T GET ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO MAKE ITS FOOD SO IT DIDN'T SORT
Line_4006	ELL THERE IS A THING IN LEAVES CALLED CLOROFUILL AND OBSERVES THE SUNLIGHT AND REFLECTS IT GREEN MEANING THIS DIDN'T GET ANY SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN'T REFLECT OFF RAIN
Line_4007	I DON'T THINK THIS PLANT HAS GOTTEN ANY OCCIGEN
Line_4008	IT DIDN'T LET IT SAY BREATHE MEANING IT COULDN'T GET ANY AIR INTO ITS LEAVES OR LET IT FLOW THROUGHOUT
Line_4009	THIS PLANT HAS EVERYTHING PUT IT NEEDS EXCEPT WATER WHICH HELPS
Line_4010	THE PLANT HASN'T BEEN GETTING ANY WATER MEANING NOT OF ITS FOOD CAN BE THROUGHOUT ITS BODY
Line_4011	THE PLANT HAS EVERYTHING IN ADDS IT HAS THE WATER TO HELP EVERYTHING MOVE OUT THE SUN SO IT CAN GET ITS ENERGY AND THE OCCIGEN SO IT DOESN'T DRIVE OUT
Line_4012	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT CAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY CAN LEAD UP TO OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT NEED TO EAT THESE PRODUCERS IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
Line_4013	TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS AND THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY ALSO NEED MANY TIPS OF THINGS LIKE WATER OCIGIN AND LIGHT TO SURVIVE E
Line_4014	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT SSTUMS
Line_4015	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CELLS AND WE DID A EAST EXPERIMENT A FU TIMES AGO
Line_4016	IT SHOWS DIFFERENT CELLS AND HOW THEY'RE GROUP
Line_4017	PLANT CELLS ARE LIGHTER DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HUMAN TELLS
Line_4018	THIS ONLY SHOWS ONE SEXPTION AS DOES IT WITH HUMANS
Line_4019	THAT THERE IS SHOWING A TIP OF SHELL AND A PART OF THE LEGS
Line_4020	THEY ARE VERY LONG ENOUGH TO BE GROUP D TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE A MUSL
Line_4021	I THINK IT SHOWS NERVES ON THE BRAIN
Line_4022	IT'S SHOWING ME A BRAIN TELLS
Line_4023	I THINK THIS SHOWS ANOTHER PART OF AN ARM SOME CELLS
Line_4024	TO D CELLS ARE IMPORTANT THE MAKE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BODY
Line_4025	WE'RE MADE OF MANY SELLS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT TIPS OF CELLS EVEN
Line_4026	THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS OR SELLS AND THERE'S A LOT
Line_4027	I THINK MAYBE THE HUMAN HAS MORE CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MAKE UP A LARGER THINGS
Line_4028	IT SHOWS A BUTTERFLY WHICH MAY BE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AS WE A
Line_4029	IT SHOWS A BUTTERFLY S DIGEST STU AS WELL AS A HUMAN
Line_4030	THEY BOTH HAVE A STUMIC IN A WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEIR WAIST
Line_4031	SHOWING US PERHAPS WHERE THE UM DIGESTIVE SIT START
Line_4032	IT CHOSE AND BREAKS DOWN FOODS BEFORE IT HAD STUN IN THE THALPHICUS
Line_4033	IT PUSHES DOWN FOOD INTO THE STOMACH WITH SOME STRONG MUSCLES
Line_4034	I KNOW THAT THIS IS VITAL SO THE CHU FOOD CAN GET INTO THE STUMICE AND SO IT CAN SO THE FOOD CAN BE BREAKED DOWN EVEN FOR
Line_4035	THE SMALL INTESTINE REMOVES NEW TRANS WELL THE LARGE INTESTINES REMOVES MOISTURE
Line_4036	THEY ARE THE LONGEST PUR THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_4037	ERLLYER WE'VE TALK ABOUT THE MASCULA SISTM AND PLANTS
Line_4038	IT'S PARA IT HAS PARALLEL LINES
Line_4039	MAKE BELIEVE IT COULD BE A A BELIEFE
Line_4040	PALMATE IT HAS PALMATE VAINS
Line_4041	F LET HAS PENNY GAINS
Line_4042	I THINK THE RAINS AR FOR CARRYING NUTRIENT AROUND
Line_4043	I THINK THIS SHOWS A PLAN SEED TO MAKE FOUND
Line_4044	I THINK THE NU TURNS AND WATER AND FOOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE AIMS ON LEAVE
Line_4045	I THINK THIS IS SHOWING WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAF
Line_4046	TAKE T TRANSPORTS FLUID AND OCIGEN LIKE THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM IN HUMANS
Line_4047	IT CHOSE WATER BEING RELEASED FROM LAVE
Line_4048	COVERING ALL DIFF THINGS IN SCIENCE
Line_4049	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPATORY SYSTEM
Line_4050	I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE PARTS OF THE RESPATORY SYSTEM
Line_4051	U CAN SEE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
Line_4052	THIS SHOWS HOW AIR GETS INTO THE LONGSUM HOW IT GETS OUT IT THE LUNG
Line_4053	RAINING HELPS US GET OXYGEN IN AND CARBONDIOSIDE OUT
Line_4054	IT COMES IN THROUGH THE MOUTH I KNOWS AND IT'S FILTERED
Line_4055	AN HAILLING IS BRINGING IN EX HAILLING AND SENDING OUT
Line_4056	THE MAIN ORGAN IS THELONG
Line_4057	WHEN IT MOVES IT EITHER CAUSES LOW PRESSURE HIGH PRESSURE TO GET AIR IN OR OUT
Line_4058	OCIGIN GETTING INTO A BLOODEN CARBONDIOCIDE GETTING OUT
Line_4059	S WE DON'T HAVE RANDOM GASSES IN OUR BLOOD
Line_4060	AIR IS DRAGGED IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE AND IT IS BROUGHT DOWN BY THE TRQIEA
Line_4061	THE DIEFRAM DOES ALL THE WORKS BY CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING
Line_4062	NOTHING MUCH
Line_4063	BE BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_4064	BECAUSE OF HOW ALL THE SYSTEMS THE CAR HAS WITH OTHER THINGS
Line_4065	BECAUSE HUMAN BODIES ARE SYSTEMS TWO
Line_4066	BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IT HAS
Line_4067	BECAUSE OF HOW IT HAS LIKE THE ARMS THE HEADS THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES APART
Line_4068	WE'RE REPEAT THE QUESTION
Line_4069	BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND LAND
Line_4070	RETREAT THE QUESTION PLEASE
Line_4071	IT SHOWS THE FLIERS IN THE LITTLE HILL AND SHOWS LIKE ALL THE STUFF UNDER WATER AND THE BUILDINGS
Line_4072	THERE ARE SOURCES
Line_4073	BY FEARS ALL ABOUT LIKE ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND BIRDS THAT ARE ON LIVING ON ERTH
Line_4074	I I DON'T GET THAT QUESTION
Line_4075	IT'S JUST LIKE THE FOOD CHAIN
Line_4076	BECAUSE WHEN LIKE A DEER INTO FISH A FISH IT DOES SMALLER FISH
Line_4077	SAY THAT QUESTION AGAIN I DIDN'T HEAR YOU VERY GOOD
Line_4078	THE TWO PARTS THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE
Line_4079	HOCK AND SNAKE
Line_4080	SAY THE EXACT QUESTION YOU JUST SAID YOU'RE SPEAKING ROLL
Line_4081	IT'S ALL A CISTOM
Line_4082	BECAUSE ALL THE PICTURES IT YOU IS SHOWING OR ARE SYSTEM
Line_4083	BECAUSE A CAR IS A SYSTEM
Line_4084	BECAUSE THES ITEMS ARE A SUB SISTOM OF THE SISTOM
Line_4085	BECAUSE THE SISTOM A SO SISTOMS
Line_4086	BECAUSE IT'S A SISTOM WITH A BUNCHES BUNCH ARE DIFFERENT UH SUB SISTOM
Line_4087	BECAUSE IT IS A YSTERMANI HAS LOTS OF OTHER LOTS OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4088	DIGESTIVE SYSTEM A
Line_4089	REPEAT THE STINK IN QUESTI-
Line_4090	THEY BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SISTMAND
Line_4091	THAT THE HEART IS ONE JINTCYSTOM
Line_4092	WELL THE CIRCULATORY CYSTOM THAT IS AN SCAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4093	TOES ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE BODY
Line_4094	THE BLUE PART ARE CELLS
Line_4095	BECAUSE IT IS IN A CIRCUITORY SISTOM
Line_4096	BLOOD BLOOD HEART AND YOU BLSULS
Line_4097	IT PUMPS BLOOD SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4098	THEY ARE THE L I B RYSTLES ARE BLOOD THAT GOES IN YOUR HEART AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4099	RUNNING ABOUT CSISTOMS
Line_4100	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4101	IT HAS A LOT OF AN DIRECTING PARTS
Line_4102	AS A SUB SISTYM AND A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4103	THEY ARE SUBSISTOMS
Line_4104	UP ALL OF ITS INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4105	BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND THERE ARE A FEW SUBSISTOMS IN THERE
Line_4106	IT IS A SUB SISTOM IN THE UNIVERSE AND IT CAN BE A SYSTEM OF IT'S OWN I GUESS
Line_4107	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_4108	THERE ARE THREE THERE IS THE ATMOSFERE HIDROSFERE AND THE I FORGOT THE LAST N
Line_4109	THEY ARE A PART
Line_4110	I THINK THERE'S THE FOOD WEB AN FOOD WEB
Line_4111	WELL THE EVERY THING GOES TO THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI WHEN IT DIES
Line_4112	UM SISTOMS
Line_4113	THEY ARE ALL PART OF A FOOD WEB
Line_4114	IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD FROM THE SUN
Line_4115	THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER ORGANISMS THEY MAKE SHIOOGER FROM THE SUN WATER AND OCEGON
Line_4116	THE GRASS IN THE PINE CONE
Line_4117	FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_4118	THE RAVET HELISERED THE BEADL THE BLUGEY THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE
Line_4119	DECOMPOSING OTHER ORGANISMS OTHER DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4120	BACTERIA AND FUNGI ARE DECOMPOSERS
Line_4121	AH YEAH PRODUCER IS MISSING
Line_4122	CONE THI
Line_4123	THE MISSING ORGANISM IS FUN
Line_4124	A PRODUCER IS MISSING THERE
Line_4125	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4126	UM UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4127	TO EAT MEAT AND TO EAT PLANTS
Line_4128	CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_4129	OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_4130	A BEAR IS A OMNIVORE
Line_4131	TO EAT ONLY DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4132	THEY ONLY EAT DEAD ORGANISMS AND YEAH
Line_4133	D COMPOSUERS
Line_4134	A MOOSE IS A PURBAVORM
Line_4135	THE FOX IS UM THE FOX IS A OMNIVORE
Line_4136	THIS IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_4137	A RED WARM IS A D A COMPOSER YEAH
Line_4138	T BASICALLY CLEAN UP
Line_4139	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4140	IT'S WATER AND IT GROWS
Line_4141	THE EAST IS ORGANISM AND THE EAST IS KIND OF A D COMPOSER AND IT BREAKS DOWN THE COOKIE
Line_4142	THE YEAST NEEDS THE WATER TO BREAK DOWN THE COOKIE FOR OBSORBION
Line_4143	THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY'RE USED ON BREAD
Line_4144	WE WERE GOING WHEAT
Line_4145	H HAS SOME LIGHT THE OTHER DOESN'T HAVE SOME LIGHT
Line_4146	THE RUSTS OF THE PLANT AND WATERING THE PLANT
Line_4147	WATER SUNLIGHT AND SOIL
Line_4148	DOES NEED WATER BUT IT NEEDS IT ALSO NEEDS OCTRIGON IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT AND IT NEEDS NUTRIENTS
Line_4149	THIS IS AIR PLANTS SO NEED AIR TO SIRVIVE
Line_4150	SOME LIGHT AND NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SIRVIVE
Line_4151	NEW TRAINS PLANTS DO NEED NEW TRAINS TO SURVIVE
Line_4152	LITER PLANTS DON'T NEED FERTALLIZER BUT IT HELPS THE PLANTS
Line_4153	HOUSES IT'S ABOUT IT
Line_4154	UHM YE
Line_4155	UM IT SHOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE OF THE MATERIALS WOULD GET RID OF
Line_4156	BUT
Line_4157	THERE IS NO AIR SO IT WOULD DIE
Line_4158	KILL ED IT ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4159	THE WATER IT'S NOT AS BAD AS NO AIR BUT STILLS ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4160	THEY BOTH KILLED PLANTS
Line_4161	IT'S ALL THREE NEW TRANS WITCH MAKES IT OSSOME AND YEAH
Line_4162	BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE NEW GRAMS
Line_4163	THERE ARE THEN START OF THE FOOD WEB IF THERE WASN'T PRODUCERS THEN THE FOOD WEB WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4164	M FOOD WEBS AND SISTOMS AND CLEAVE S
Line_4165	IT'S FEST IT'S EST
Line_4166	THAT EST IS ALIVE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS A SHELL OR SEALS IS ALIVE
Line_4167	IT'S DIFFERENT TIPS OF SHELLS
Line_4168	I SEE SHELLS OF LEAF AND IT LOOKS COOL
Line_4169	I SEEN MUSCLES SELLS
Line_4170	THAT THEY'RE MUSCLE AND THEY'RE SELLS
Line_4171	IT SHOWS ME THE BRAIN SPELLS
Line_4172	I SEE REGULAR CELLS
Line_4173	SKIN SCALLOWS CAN DROP DRY AND DIE
Line_4174	SCAND ONE BLOUD ORGANS
Line_4175	ENDS HAVE MILLI AN AND BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS A SELLS AND EAST ONLY HAS ONE
Line_4176	THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_4177	I I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4178	IT'S THE DIGESTIVE SISTOM FOR HUMANS AND FOR BUTTERFLY'S
Line_4179	WE BOTH HAVE AISTOMS
Line_4180	IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SISTOM
Line_4181	I HARRY TOLD YOU IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMICK
Line_4182	THE INTESTANCE ABSORBED THE WATER AND NEISCHERANS
Line_4183	SURE DIGESTIVE SISTSM SELLS THOSE IN THE MAIN POINTS
Line_4184	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_4185	IT IS A LEAF AND IT GAINS
Line_4186	IT'S A PARALLEL LE
Line_4187	IT'S A HAND I MY LEAVE SO IT'S NOT BUG IN ME IT'S KITTING IT'S A HAND PULL MAY LEAF
Line_4188	NOW IDEA MAYBE A CHAIN SAI LEAF
Line_4189	THE EDGES LOOK LIKE A CHAIN S AND THE VAINES MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A FEATHERS SO MAYBE IT'S A FEATHER CHANGE SAH
Line_4190	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY HISTOM
Line_4191	UM I DON'T KNOW UM IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCULATORY ISTOM
Line_4192	A UM LIT SHOES WATER
Line_4193	UH NOT VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4194	CIRCULATORY SISTOM YEAH CIRCULATORY SISTOM FOR THE WE
Line_4195	THIKULATORIS CISTOM FOR THE WIND I TOLD YOU
Line_4196	A'S HUMAN RESPETORY SISTOM THIS AIR SISTOM FOR THE WIND
Line_4197	UH OH TWO COMES IN THE BODY AND SEE OR TWO COMES OUT OF THE BODY
Line_4198	LUNGS
Line_4199	UH THEY'RE IMPORTANT
Line_4200	IT UH GIVES CORD INTO THE BLOOD SCREEN AND IT TAKES OFF SO TO
Line_4201	IT'S IN FOR PORTION FOR YOUR BLIDGE
Line_4202	EH
Line_4203	FROM A AND B NO IT WAS A NO EH
Line_4204	THE UM A SOPICIS
Line_4205	UM I'M DOING OKAY UM HOW ARE YOU GOING
Line_4206	YOU SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN SCIENCE
Line_4207	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SISTORM
Line_4208	IT HAS A CIRCLE TORE IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE AREA AND IT COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE VAIN AND THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD
Line_4209	O TWO OR CARBON I HOCKS SIDE
Line_4210	IT'S BLOOD AND THE BLUE PART ARE THE CELLS AND THE BLUE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING OR CARBON DYOCIDE
Line_4211	BANGS AND ARTERY
Line_4212	IRON UM CAN UM REPEAT THE
Line_4213	A IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4214	UH BED COMING IN AND OUT AND IT BEING GROWS KIND OF
Line_4215	IT HOLD BLOOD
Line_4216	THEY CARRY LADY THEY CARRY BLOOD
Line_4217	IT'S THE HEART IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4218	SEE CARRIES THE BLOOD TO THE CELLS
Line_4219	BLOOD TO THE SELLS CARRY BLOOD TO THE SELLS
Line_4220	IT IS THE RESPOTORY SISTOM
Line_4221	IT'S BREATHING TO GET OCRIGEN TO THE BLOOD TO CARRY TO THE CELLS
Line_4222	IT'S BREATHING
Line_4223	IT TAKES OCTRAGEN AND TO THE BLOOD TOO
Line_4224	DO UM IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ORGAN IN RESPIRATORY S
Line_4225	THEY ARE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE SHAKE AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
Line_4226	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4227	THAT TRIKE YEAH IT'S SE STOP ASKING MU CARS
Line_4228	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4229	THEY ALL LIVE ON EARTH THEY ALL HARE THINGS
Line_4230	IT IS TAPE IT'S A TAPE OF A CHAIN
Line_4231	THERE ARE SUBSYSTEMS IN THE COLO
Line_4232	THERE IS THINGS THAT ARE LITTLE THAT ARE PARTS THAT GOE IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT WOULD BE CALLED A SUBSYSTEM
Line_4233	BECAUSE IT HAS SUB ISTOMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_4234	YOU CAN SEE PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4235	THE SHAPE OF THE HEART
Line_4236	THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE HUMAN BODY
Line_4237	THEY'RE INTERACTING PARTS AND
Line_4238	ERTH WHICH IS A STOM
Line_4239	I THINK THE LIONS FEAR
Line_4240	I THINK THE BIO FUEL IS MADE OF WATER AND ANIMALS
Line_4241	BECAUSE THE BIALSEER IS IN THOSE PLACES
Line_4242	THE BOREAL FORISTT AND THE WET LANDS
Line_4243	ALL OF THE FOODWIBBS HAVE A HUMAN BEING IN IT
Line_4244	THAT EVERYTHING COMES FROM THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA A
Line_4245	IT'S AN ORGANISMS GETTING WHAT IT NEEDS
Line_4246	THEY'RE ADDING IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Line_4247	IT IS BACTERIA
Line_4248	NOTHING WELL I DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_4249	WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIVING ORGANISMS AND LIVING THINGS AND ORGANISMS
Line_4250	ONE OF THEM HAS HAD MORE WATER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_4251	R REPEAT
Line_4252	THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND IT IS GROWING
Line_4253	WATER AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4254	PLANTS DO NEED WATER JUST ALIVE BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE HUMANS FIELD FOR THEM THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT NEITHER CONHUMANS
Line_4255	PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO LIVE A AND TO GROW
Line_4256	IT IS SHOWING YOU PICTURE AWAY A PLANT AND A WATER DROP
Line_4257	UM AIR YOU CAN'T SEE BUT YOU CAN FEEL UMM
Line_4258	YES I THINK THEY NEED IT MOST OF THE TIMES
Line_4259	THE SUN IS SHINING DOWN ON THE UH PLANT
Line_4260	SOME MIGHT TWELVE
Line_4261	YES I
Line_4262	YES DEFONATELY
Line_4263	UM THIS IS A BURGERS
Line_4264	YES YEA
Line_4265	ANYTHING FUD IS VERY IMPORTANT TORALSSLA OR ELSE IT E A WORK LIKE IT IS
Line_4266	IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE PEOPLE PLANTS NEED FOOD TO THRIVE
Line_4267	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IT SHOWS
Line_4268	YOU KNOW I
Line_4269	WELL NO BECAUSE FRTALIZER CAN KILL THEM WHICH I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
Line_4270	IT'S A HOUSE
Line_4271	NO PLANTS DO NOT NEED FILTER TWO
Line_4272	GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_4273	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT'S IN OUR BODY
Line_4274	WE'VE BEEN TALKING OF THE HUMAN BODY AND
Line_4275	THEY BOTH HAVE SIMILAR BLOOD CELLS I MEAN SELLS NOT BLOOD SELLS SELLS
Line_4276	UM IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4277	I SEE BLUE SELLS THEN I SEE BLUE KIND OF SHORT SQWRIGLY LINES
Line_4278	THEY'RE ALL KIND OF TOGETHER THEY NEVER FLOW APART FROM EACH OTHER THEY KIND OF LIKE A PAR
Line_4279	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4280	UH I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
Line_4281	U THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH THERE ARE VERY VERY MANY OF THEM
Line_4282	THE SOPHI TRANSFERS THE BROKEN UP PIECES OF FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
Line_4283	THE TOPICS PLACE A BIG ROLE IN THE DYJESTIVSISTM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FOOD GETS DOWN TO THE STOMACH
Line_4284	TO TAKE THE FOOD AND BRIK IT UP INTO PIECES AND TO MAKE SURE IT TRANSFERS TO THE SMALL INTESTINE
Line_4285	OH THAT IT PUTS IT INTO ALL THE WASTE IT PUTS IT IN THE WAYS AND THEN IT COMES OUT
Line_4286	WHEN THE COOKIE GETS WET IT TURNS INTO USED
Line_4287	MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE A A TIP OF PLANT
Line_4288	WHERE I SEND IT'S IT IT'S GRASS AND IT'S THE ROPE IT'S A T PLANT
Line_4289	ON THE LEFT THE GRASS IS A LITTLE MORE DECAYED
Line_4290	BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF PLANT BUT ONE OF THEM IS MORE DECADED THAN THE OTHER
Line_4291	ONE WOMAN HAS PROBABLY NOT GOT IN AS MUCH WATER
Line_4292	THE PLANTS ALSO HAVE BASIC TRAVEL NEEDS LIKE WATER AND AN
Line_4293	UNIT AND WATER
Line_4294	YES THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE IN IT BECAUSE AND WHENEVER SOMETHING IS D HIGRATED IT WILL IT WILL DIE
Line_4295	I I THINK THEY DO NEED WATER BECAUSE UM PRITY MUCH EVERY LIVING INSTINCT NEEDS WATER TO IS TO SERVIVE WITHOUT IT WE'D ALL D HIDRA AND DIE
Line_4296	ALL LIVING THINGS NEED AIR TOO BREATH
Line_4297	YES EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS AIR TO DRIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T BREATHE AND THEY JUST DI
Line_4298	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK PLANTS DO NEED AIR BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY'D ALL JUST THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE AND THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4299	PLANTS NEEDS SO AS HAS TO DRIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'D BE TOO COLD AND THEY AND THEN THEY THAT THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_4300	WE YES BECAUSE THEN THEY'D UM GET TOO COLD AND DIE
Line_4301	I I SEE A PICTURE OF A HAMBURGER AND A PLANT
Line_4302	YES IT WOULD DIE OF HUNGER AND UM THERE WOULD BE NO AN
Line_4303	WITH THAT UM A CERTAIN HAVE FLOWED UM IT PLANTS WILL DIE
Line_4304	YES IF PLANTS DIDN'T GET FOOD THEY JUST D
Line_4305	SOME KIND OF CAN AND A LIKE A MIXTURE OF AN APPLE
Line_4306	YES UM BECAUSE IT'S A SOIL AND GRAMS NEED TO BE PUT IN SOIL JUST AVIVE
Line_4307	AN NOT NEEDED BUT IT'S A HELP HELPFUL THING FOR PLANTS
Line_4308	UM IT'S A HOUSE WHICH COULD BE A TYPE OF SHELTER FORM A PLANT
Line_4309	PLAY FILTERS WHEN IT'S LIKE COLD DURING LIKE THE WINTER AND OTHER TIMES
Line_4310	I I THINK THEY DO NEED UM SHELTER TO THE TO SURVIVE LI OTHERWISE UM DURING THE WINTER THEY JUST FREE UP AND DIE
Line_4311	IT SHOWS THAT UM PLANTS NEED TO SUBMIT WATER AND THEN UM WATER CAN EVAPORATE FROM IT UM
Line_4312	BECAUSE IT'S THERE ARE MAN UM S NEEDS FOR SERVIVAL AND WITHOUT IT THEY JUST STOP
Line_4313	THE THEY GIRL ATE A UM FEET ON TIGHT ENERGY
Line_4314	THEY DO MIX FOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
Line_4315	IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN A
Line_4316	IT DOESN'T IT DIDN'T GET IT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH SUNLIGHT
Line_4317	UH IT WON'T GET ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4318	UM IT LOOKS MORE MUCH MORE DECADE AND UM YEAH AND ORANGES AND SICKLY BECAUSE IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND WATER BUT NO AIR
Line_4319	IT GETS ENOUGH WATER AND SODA BUT NOT ENOUGH AIR
Line_4320	IT MAKES IT DECAY EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES WITHOUT SUNLIGHT
Line_4321	UM IT LOOKS SICKLY TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER
Line_4322	IT HAS NOT BEEN GOING TO GET ANY WATER BY IT'S BEEN GETTING AIR AND SUNDIGHT
Line_4323	UM WITHOUT WATER ALL IT WILL UM UM D
Line_4324	THE IT DOES NOT LOOK STICKY LOOKS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER SUNLIGHT AND AIR
Line_4325	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF WATER SUNK OR AIR
Line_4326	UM THIS ONE HAS ENOUGH WATER AIR AND SOME HEAT
Line_4327	THE PENNY IS STAYING HEALTHY
Line_4328	THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FEED ON EACH OTHER AND THERE ARE DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_4329	AH I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4330	THEY'RE PART OF THE FINGER OF UH CIDWEB
Line_4331	UM WITH THE OUR PRODUCERS UM THE WEMBS WOULD DIM START FALLING UP
Line_4332	THEY STU WITH H COMPOSERS THEN PRODUCERS THEN THEY END WITH CONSUMERS
Line_4333	THE PLANTS NEED UHM FOOD AND WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SHELTER OR FURTALIZED
Line_4334	UM THE HUMAN AND THE EAST ARE BOTH MADE OF SELLS THEY ARE DIFFERENT POR SELLS BUT THEY'RE STILL SELLS
Line_4335	PLANTS ARE NOT SINGLE LED ORGANISMS THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE CELL
Line_4336	UH UM HUMANS ALSO HAVE SEVERAL A LOT OF CELLS
Line_4337	THERE ARE BRAIN SHOWS AND WHICH ARE UHM DIFFERENT
Line_4338	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT IT'S THAT THESE THAT THESE ARE BRAIN SPELLS
Line_4339	I SEE SKIN SO WHICH ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM BRAIN SO AND MUSCLE SO
Line_4340	THAT UM SKIN CELLS ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4341	I DON'T THINK SO I
Line_4342	I
Line_4343	NO THINGS
Line_4344	THAT'S THE N
Line_4345	DON'T THINK SO STUPID
Line_4346	YEAH CELL
Line_4347	I DON'T KNOW THERE'S TEN THEY THAT EACH
Line_4348	AND HOW HOW
Line_4349	OH WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING SISTIM
Line_4350	THEY ALL INTERACT WITH PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SO THEY WORK SO THE THE WHOLE THING WOULD EXPLODE
Line_4351	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKES THE CAR WORK
Line_4352	CONNECT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE US MOVE
Line_4353	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4354	THE INTERACTING SUB SYSTEMS THAT MAKE THE CAR WORKS
Line_4355	ES INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE HUMAN BODY WORK
Line_4356	IT HAS LOTS OF SUB SYSTEMS THAT MAKES THE WHOLE IT WORK CORRECTLY
Line_4357	THEY INTERACT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE EARTH LIKE A
Line_4358	I SEE THE HIDROLIC SISTM THE
Line_4359	THERE IS THE ECOSECO CISTOM
Line_4360	THE BIRD SPEER IS LIVING THINGS
Line_4361	BIO SEAR IS ALL THE WATER AND THE WORLD
Line_4362	ECO CISTOMS LIVE ON THE BIRDS SPEER BECAUSE BRO SPEER IS WATER AND WE NEED TO LIVE WITH WA
Line_4363	HUMAN BODY FISH THING SORE WHATEVER
Line_4364	THIS IS THE ONE OF THE EGALACYSTOMS FOR FORISTS THIS ALSO SHOWS A FUEL D CHAIN
Line_4365	I HOW PREDATORS EAT OTHER SMALLER THING
Line_4366	SOMETHING EATS SOMETHING THIS THING THAT'S GETS EAT ENERGY TRANSFERS IN TO A THING THAT IT ITS
Line_4367	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIFE CYCLES PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS ARE ALL PART OF THE LIFE CYCLE S
Line_4368	IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD BY FOO COM
Line_4369	THEY DO NOT EAT OTHER ORGAN
Line_4370	THE BACTERIA FUNGI PINE TREE AND GRA
Line_4371	YOU EAT OTHER LIVING ORGANISM
Line_4372	THEY EAT OTHER LIVING ORGAN
Line_4373	THE RABBIT STANDMAT SAND SALAMANDER BEATLE SPARROW RED TILLED HOCKENS SNIC
Line_4374	IT EATS DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4375	THE FUNGI AND THE BACK THERE
Line_4376	IT'S ABOUT WHAT A PLANTS AND ANIMALS EAT
Line_4377	DEER AND RAT ARE RBEVORS
Line_4378	YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEATS
Line_4379	THEY EAT MEATS OR DECAYING MEATS AND BERRIES OR CARRYING METER
Line_4380	A KINDOVORE OR AN ERRIVA
Line_4381	AERBIEVOR
Line_4382	THEY BREAK DOWN THE BAD DECAYING MATTER AND MAKE IT SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE EARTH AND SOL
Line_4383	RUNNING ABOUT DIGESTIVE SISTOM
Line_4384	IT HAS TO DO WITH THE EAST THING THE FEST WILL GROW
Line_4385	IT'S WATCHING EAST GROW OUT OF ITS DORMETS STAGE
Line_4386	I THINK THE RUNS GET USED OUT OF ITS DORMET STAY
Line_4387	I THINK THE SOILS ARE USED
Line_4388	WE'VE BEEN DOING AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHICH TO SEE IF WET WILL GO IN DARK BAGS AND WET WILL GO IN LIGHT BAGS
Line_4389	THE UNHEALTHY LOOKING ONE WAS GROWN IN THE DARK BAGS
Line_4390	SHOWING US HOW FOOD HOW THE PLANTS FOOD IS PRODUCED D
Line_4391	CARBON DIOCSIDE SENDILIGHT WATER
Line_4392	MEADES NEW TRENDS TO SERVIVE
Line_4393	IT SHOWS A CAN WITH THE TOMATO WATER
Line_4394	THERE IS A HOUSE AND PLANT HOW NICE
Line_4395	IT SHOWS HOW FAR THE CYMPHACIS WORKS AND AND A FAR CYMPHECIS NEEDS TO WOR
Line_4396	SO THEY COULD GET FOOD FROM BOTTLES AND BY
Line_4397	IT CRIPPLED IT AND IT'S DYING
Line_4398	THE PLANT NEEDS ALL THREE THINGS TO SURVIVE AND MAKE ITS OWN ENERGY
Line_4399	IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS IT NEEDS FOR TWO SHEVAR SO IT IS GROWING QUITE NICELY
Line_4400	IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO SURVIV
Line_4401	EVENTUALLY THE ENERGY FROM THE PLANTS COMES UP TO SHOCK IGLES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_4402	YELLOW HELLO W AND GOOD BYE
Line_4403	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CISTUMS AND SUB CISTOMS
Line_4404	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4405	IT HAS DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4406	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS SO HOW DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4407	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT HELPS IT WORK AND IF ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS WEREN'T THERE IT WOULDN'T BE
Line_4408	ALL OF THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4409	CAUSE IT HAS MANY PARTS THAT MAKE THE BODY WORK
Line_4410	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INSECTING PARTS
Line_4411	IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND SELF SISTOMB LIKE ANIMALS AND HUMANS IN PLANTS
Line_4412	TALKING ABOUT CIYSTOMS AND IT IT'S ALSO
Line_4413	ABOUT SISTOMS AND LIT
Line_4414	BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY CONTRACTING PARTS
Line_4415	IT HAS INTERESTING PARTS THAT MAKES IT BE OVER THE MUD AND THE CONTRACTING PART IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S MAKING IT WORK
Line_4416	IT HAS MANY DISTANT INTERECTING PARTS THAT CONNECT WITH EACH OTHERS SO THE WHOLE BODY'S OF
Line_4417	WELL WITH OUT ANY OF THESE THE THE WHOLE SYSTEM MOTOR WORKS
Line_4418	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS IT WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE SYSTEMS
Line_4419	MAN
Line_4420	BIOSPHERE IS ABOUT PLANTS UNIN S FISHES AND WATERS
Line_4421	THEY SHOW WHAT ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER AND WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS IN THE ECO
Line_4422	IT'S GOING GOOD I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4423	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE SURFACE
Line_4424	WE PUT WAX PAPER ON THE BLUE SURFACE
Line_4425	WATER SLIDES DOWN A SLOPE
Line_4426	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER TO ONE DROP AND LESS WATER TO ANOTHER DROP AND THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS
Line_4427	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE S SLOPE
Line_4428	WE DID NOT USE THE ROCK OR THE PAPER CLIP BUT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BOTH SKUNK
Line_4429	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_4430	KIND OF BLENDED WITH THE OTHER WATERS BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOT IT STIRRED OR MIXED BY ACCIDENT
Line_4431	COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN RUMB TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT EITHER STAYS IN THE VILE OR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_4432	WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING A WITH ICE AND WATER
Line_4433	THEY COULD BE LIQUIDS
Line_4434	WHEN SWEATER COOLS IT GETS DENSER
Line_4435	UM DENSITY IS MAKING THE WATER LEVEL DROP BELOW RUM TEMPERATURE
Line_4436	ICE IS ACTUALLY LESS DENSE THAN WATER BECAUSE IT FLOATS
Line_4437	THAT TELLS ME THAT WHEN I THAT THE COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN REGULAR WATER
Line_4438	O WATER CREATES LESS DENSITY SO THAT'S SPACICALLY WHAT IT DOES
Line_4439	WHEN YOU PUT WATER IN THE FREEZER IT TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND IT BECOMES A SOLIDS
Line_4440	IT GETS LESS DENSE CAUSING THE WATER TO RISES
Line_4441	WATER TAKES UP MORE SPACE AS IT IS HEATED
Line_4442	IT MEANS TO SOLITIFY I THINK
Line_4443	H WATER ON THE CRFICE IS EVAPORATING OVER TIME
Line_4444	IT TURNS OUT MY MICROPHONE WAS NOT IN THE PROPER POSITION SO THAT'S WHY YOU COULDN'T NEAR ME BUT I COULD HEAR YOU
Line_4445	THE UN COVERED WHEAT PAPER TOWEL
Line_4446	HAS MORE WATER IN IT BECAUSE THE CUP ON RIGHT HAS COMPLETELY EVAPORATED
Line_4447	THE WET PAPER TOWELS STAYED WHEAT BECAUSE TO PLASTIC LID IS SELLING IN THE HUMANITY
Line_4448	WE HAVE TEN
Line_4449	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EXPOSED TO SHEET WHICH CAUSES EVAPORATION
Line_4450	THE WATER ON THE CIRFACE IS TOUCHING THE AIR CAUSING IT TO BE ABLE TO EVAPORATE
Line_4451	THE WATER ON THE CARFICE IS EVAPORATING
Line_4452	WHEN WATER VAPER TOUCHES A COLD CUP IT FORMES CONDENSATION WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST
Line_4453	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS REALLY COLD
Line_4454	I THINK THE DROPS ARE THE WATER ON THE LID ARE WATER DROP LITS SO THAT BASICALLY IS
Line_4455	THE WATER DROP LITS FORMED INSIDE THE CONDENSATION CHAMBER SO IT BASICALLY IS S
Line_4456	WE OBSERVED THAT THE CONDENSATION WAS IN THE INSIDE WITH OUR ACTUAL CONDENSATION CHAMBERS
Line_4457	THE WATER HAS TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE CUP BUT WITH THE LID IT DEFIES EVAPORATION
Line_4458	IT IS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT JUST AMASES METAL
Line_4459	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOIL AND GRAVEL
Line_4460	I SEE A PILE OF SOIL AND A A PILE OF GRAVEL
Line_4461	I KNOW THAT WATER CAN FLOW S SOIL AND WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH GRAVEL
Line_4462	WHAT D I SAY WELL THEY ACT THEY ACT DIFFERENTLY WITH EACH OTHER
Line_4463	WATER CAN SPIN HA WATER WE ALL TO MAKE UH
Line_4464	FIVE OF THE RED THING S THREE OF THE
Line_4465	IT IS A WATER MILL WHICH HELPS POWER THE HOUSE AND YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THIS QUESTION
Line_4466	DISTANCES SPACICALLY WHAT WE DID AND IT
Line_4467	UM FORCE ANOTHER BLADE IS RIGHT THERE SO THAT KEEPS IT SPINNING AS LONG AS THERE'S FLOW OF WATER
Line_4468	BYE MARNEY I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU
Line_4469	I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4470	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND UM IT'S PROPERTIES
Line_4471	THE WATER IS MAKING BEDS ON THE ALUMINIUM FOIL
Line_4472	THE PAPER TAIL HAS OABSORBED THE WATER
Line_4473	THE PAPER TAIL HAS OBSORBED THE WATERS LEAVING A TINY MARK
Line_4474	THE SMALLER DROP LITES CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A BIGGER DROP LIT
Line_4475	OT ARE ON DIFFERENT CIRFICES CAN
Line_4476	THE WATER OR THE PAPER ALL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER
Line_4477	THE SOAPY WATER DECREASES TO ER RE ATTENTION WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE SURFACE ATTENTION
Line_4478	E CAUSING THE WATER TO NOT RISES HIGH WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE SURFACE TENSION
Line_4479	YES DROPLETS OF WATER ARE COMING OUT
Line_4480	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH WATER
Line_4481	CUIRFACE TENTION IS HAPPENING
Line_4482	CRFICE TENTION IS THE PROPERTY THAT KEEPS WATER TOGETHER AND NOT IN A THIN LINE
Line_4483	SALT WATER HAS NO EFFECTS AND IT ACTS LIKE PLAIN WATER
Line_4484	THE DOME NOT TO BUILD AS HI
Line_4485	MARNEY I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4486	UM THE BULB STARTED AT THE SIDE OF THE DISC AND WE DROPPED IT AND WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4487	BECAUSE IF EVERYONE
Line_4488	I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE TODAY Y
Line_4489	THE BULB AND WE UM
Line_4490	HOW MANY NUMBERS T OF SWINGS THERE ARE
Line_4491	AND I UM PUT EITHER ONE OF THEM ON THE STICK AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4492	YOU PUT THEM IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER STICKS THAT ARE GLOWED ON TO THE FLIPPER BASE OR THE THE FLIPPER STICK
Line_4493	ITS HELPS IT UM
Line_4494	WELL I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A BULBS SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4495	I UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUR TALKING ABOUT D MAKE REALLY MUCH SENSE
Line_4496	UM FILLING STRING SO I
Line_4497	THE RATION RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IT
Line_4498	LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT'S GOING TO DO WHEN A TEN SECOND S AND YEAH
Line_4499	THE PENDULUM BLINK
Line_4500	UM IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWEAT LIKE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM AND DOING
Line_4501	MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO T HAPPEN
Line_4502	IT WENT IT WENT IT WOULD STINK FASTER THAN IT WOULD IF YOU HAD UM CUP THAT'S UM A LITTLBIT LONGER
Line_4503	MAY NOT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD I GUESS
Line_4504	UM A CAPACITY GOES UP YOU HOLD IT HOLDS LIKE MORE PASCANGERS
Line_4505	UH OH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THE MORE YOU'RE DOING THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE IT'S GOT GO
Line_4506	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_4507	YOU WOULD PROBABLY COUNT LIKE BY TENS OR FIVES MAYBE
Line_4508	THE UH THE EX AXIS TELLS US HOW MANY RUB BANDS LIT THERE ARE
Line_4509	THE MORE RIVER BANDS THERE ARE THE FERTHER IT'S GOING IT'S GOING TO GO
Line_4510	IT'S GOING UP B
Line_4511	THAT IT'S GOING DOWN INSTEAD OF GOING UP
Line_4512	UM THEY'RE ABOUT UM LIKE HOW THINGS LIKE HOW THEY MOVE LIKE HOW THEY KEEP ON SPINNING
Line_4513	UH IT'S A PENDULUM IT THE PENNY IS WHAT KEEPS IT SPINNING B
Line_4514	ITS KEEPS ON SPINNING AT THE SAME LEVEL
Line_4515	UM ONE WILL SWING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN SLOW DOWN TWO WILL GO LONGER AND THEN SOON SO
Line_4516	UH THE THIRTY EIGHT ONE IT WILL SWING FER
Line_4517	IT WILL SWING EIGHT SWINGS FOR IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4518	SO THE SHORTER ONE UM SWUNG A LONGER AND THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER
Line_4519	UM THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY SWING THE LEAST AMOUNT
Line_4520	UM TODAY WE STARTED UM MAKING UH CATAPULTS
Line_4521	UM IT'S IT'S GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING
Line_4522	UM THE THE PAPER CLIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU COULD COULD SLIP ANYTHING WITH IT
Line_4523	UM UH ON THIS THERE IS UM UH JUST A PLAIN CORKS LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE RUBBER CORK
Line_4524	UH YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE FLIP STICK ABOUT A
Line_4525	TWENTY SEVEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4526	UM M WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING PENDULUMS AND WE STARTED DOING UM GRAPHS ABOUT THEM TO DAY
Line_4527	UM YOU IT WOULDN'T BE CONTROLLED VARIABLES
Line_4528	UM WELL THIS ONE IS ABOUT UM HOW LONG THE STRING IS AND HOW MANY SWINGS IT DID
Line_4529	THE SHORTEST LENGTHS OF STRING IS SWINGING THE MOST AND THEN THE LONGEST STRING IS SWINGING THE LEAST
Line_4530	COULD YOU YOU USE UM M GRASS AND YEAH
Line_4531	THEN THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS A NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4532	UM WE STARTED TODAY LEARNING ABOUT LIKE ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4533	WELL WE FIRST PUT THE BOAT IN WITH NO NOT PENNIES IN IT
Line_4534	UM MAYBE A MAKING THE BOAT HIGHER OR LONGER TO FIT MORE PEOPLE IN
Line_4535	THE BOAT WOULD HIT THE BOTTOM AND LIKE JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP WITHOUT GETTING WATERS IN IT
Line_4536	UM YOU CAN ONLY IT'S CONTROLLING A GOOD VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU UM ONLY SWITCH ONE THING OUT A TIME
Line_4537	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4538	UM THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4539	UHM IT IS TELLING YOU THE NUMBER OF THE CUP AND HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_4540	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANS AND UM FLOWING THEM ON FISHING WIRE
Line_4541	UM YOU WANT TO U
Line_4542	HE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4543	A NUMBER OF WINDS
Line_4544	UM SO THE THE ONES WITH OUT THE PAPER CLIPS GO IT'S THE FARTHEST AND THE ONES WITH THE MOST PAPER CLIPS GOES THE LEAST
Line_4545	UM THAT IF YOU DI CHANGE THEM IT WOULD AFFECT HOW IT FLIES
Line_4546	UM I WANTED TO FRIGGEOUT IF IF YOU HAD MORE ON UM HA WOULD IT AFFECT HOW IT FLOWS
Line_4547	CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED ALL OF THE ALL OF THE MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4548	HOW FAR THE DIST- I MEAN JUST THE DISTANCES
Line_4549	UH THE NUMBER OF PASSANGER'S
Line_4550	UM WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE DISTANCE GOES UP WHEN WE ADD PASSENGERS OR IF IT GOES DOWN THEN WE ADD PASSANGERS
Line_4551	UM WELL YOU HAVE TO YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME OR ELSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4552	UM YOU'LL GET MORE ACCURATE UM ANSWERS AND THINGS
Line_4553	UM THE MOTOR WHICH IS THE RIVER RANG AND THE DISTANCE
Line_4554	UM ON THE Y AXIS UM IT SHOWS THE THAT DISCURNS THE PLAN FLOW
Line_4555	I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN INDEPENDENT OR UH INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IS
Line_4556	M I NOTICE THAT AM INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BEFORE AND THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IS WHAT WE LEARNED
Line_4557	I FIND THAT DEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4558	I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LA PU YOU SAID
Line_4559	UM THIS POINT IS UM KEPT STAYING THE SAME SO THAT MAKES IT A STRAT LINE
Line_4560	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING UM THE FIR BASE AND UM WE DID THE GRAPH SO
Line_4561	UM THIS SPACE IT STICK IT IN SO THAT YOU COULD BALANCE THE CORK
Line_4562	UM IT UM ROOT THE ONE SAM AND THE TWO SAM AND THREE SAM
Line_4563	UM YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S UM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND NOT THE OPPOSIT WAY LIKE FROM
Line_4564	UM I NOTICE THERE'S WE'RE BY CLOAK CORK N WOODEN BULB AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT RESTS OF THE MAR
Line_4565	I SEE THAT THE PLASTIC BULB IS SPOUNDING ON THE WOOL AND IT BOUNDS BACK
Line_4566	I I THINK YOU ALREADY SHOW ME THIS PICTURE
Line_4567	IT HAS TO HIGH THE HEIGHT SO THAT CAN HELP IT LIKE YO UM GO FARTHER
Line_4568	UM PATTIOTIUM LEANED AND NUMBER OF SWEENS
Line_4569	UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE UM THE LENSE AND THE STRING
Line_4570	IT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF STRING UM EITHER A LONG LARGER OR SMALLER
Line_4571	WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING THE SWING S THAT YOU PUT ONE STREEN DOWN AND MAKES SOMETHING SWINGS
Line_4572	IT'S EXGAREAND WYBAR
Line_4573	THE NUMBERS OF STRING SWITCHES FROM TEN TO TO HUNDRED
Line_4574	ABOUT THE HEIGHT AND WHICH IS THE CAPACAPACITY
Line_4575	I DON'T GET IT I CAN'T CLICK THE PENNIES
Line_4576	UM IT TRIED TO CLICK BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_4577	I KNOW THAT UM UH D IS WILL BE BIGGER AND
Line_4578	AND A WILL BE SMALLER ABOUT THAT UM THEN THERE IS ALL THE SAME HEIGHT IS THREE CENTIMETERS
Line_4579	YOU SHE ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME TWO SEE IT'S DIFFERENT NOT CHANGE LIKE THREE OR FOUR VARIABLES AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES ITS DIFFERENT
Line_4580	I THINK YOU ARE READY SHOW ME THIS UHM PICTURE
Line_4581	M OF COURSE IF THE WATER IS MOVING I THINK THE PENNY WILL TIP OR THE WATER WILL GO IN
Line_4582	TE ME AND MY PARTNER JUST MAKE THE PLANT SO
Line_4583	NO WE DIDN'T GET TO PUT THE FISHING LINE TO OUR PLANE
Line_4584	YOU JUST EX MEAN THAT QUESTION
Line_4585	UM ONE OF THE STRING IS STRAIGHTER AND ONE THE STRINEST LOSER
Line_4586	I THINK THIS ONLY HAS ONE THEY'RE BOTH CHANGE D
Line_4587	UM WELL I THINK YOU CAN UM SLIT MORE ON THIRSDAYS AND DON'T GUESS SLEEP ON FRIDAYS
Line_4588	U JUST DECKS ME THAT UM LIKE A MINUTE YOU'RE GO
Line_4589	WE CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS UM WE DO TOO FOR SIX EIGHT TEN
Line_4590	YOU CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS E AND THIS EXAMPLE
Line_4591	OR ME DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR
Line_4592	IT'S ABOUT A IT'S A GRASS AND THERE IS A WIRE ON EX AXIS S
Line_4593	THAT'S TO SEE HOW YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE WIRE E X AXIS IS THEN
Line_4594	YOU ALREADY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4595	YEAH THE NUMBER OF PAST CENURS IS THE VARIABLES ON THIS TABLE OF DATA
Line_4596	YOU OR ASKED ME THAT
Line_4597	THINGS FOR ALL YOU'RE HELP TOO
Line_4598	HEY WITH YEAH BYE
Line_4599	WE GOT DIFFERENT LE OF STRING AND SEE HOW MANY SWINGS IT WOULD MAKE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4600	WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG PIECE OF STRING YOU'LL HAVE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS AND FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4601	THERE IS A WHOLE INCH OF PENDULUMS
Line_4602	IN FIFTEEN SECANDS IT DID A FIVE SWINGS
Line_4603	A PENNY PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4604	THE BOB MAKES THE STRING SWING
Line_4605	THE LONGER THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER AMOUNT SWINGS THE PENDULUM WILL MAKE
Line_4606	WE JUST FINISHED UP THE PENDULUM X BARONMENT
Line_4607	IT'S ABOUT THE PENDULUM LENGTH AND THE NUMBER SWING THE PENDULA MAKES
Line_4608	CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF SOME THINGS
Line_4609	WHEN YOU USE A DRAW IT TELLS YOU DATA
Line_4610	WHEN YOU USE A RAFT TO HELP YOU PRODICT YOU CAN GET A BETTER CONCLUSION
Line_4611	WITH THE TWENTY LITER STRING YOU WILL GET FIFTEEN SWEEN
Line_4612	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BULBS
Line_4613	RE PAPER BOATS AND WE ARE SEEN HOW MUCH CAPACITY AND PACEANGERS A BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_4614	ARE OUR LIVE FILLS BUT WE MADE THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4615	THERE WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT IT WE JUST TESTED TO SEE HOW IT WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT DIDN'T
Line_4616	IF YOU PUT TOO MANY PENNIES IN ONE TOE IT
Line_4617	WELL IF YOU YOU STACK THE PENNIES
Line_4618	OKAY THANK YOU BYE
Line_4619	WE FINISHED MAKING OUR BOATS AND THEN WE GRAFTED ALL OUR BOATS PLUS TWO OTHERS
Line_4620	IT TOLD ME WHAT THEY
Line_4621	YOU ASK ME THAT QUESTION LAST TIME LIKE THE LAST THING YOU SAID D
Line_4622	THE PLAIN IS MOVING ACROSS THE STRAIN
Line_4623	WOULD SEE THAT UH YOUR PLAIN WON'T FLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
Line_4624	WE ONLY FLEW AT ONE DISTANCE THAT IS TWO YARDS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO ATE ANY OTHER DISTANCES
Line_4625	ONE PLAIN IS GOING ON A STRAT STRING AND THE OTHER PLAIN IS LIKE DOING KI LIKE A DIAGONAL
Line_4626	I LIKE VISITING WITH YOU TOO
Line_4627	AM AND CRAFTING
Line_4628	WELL IN THE GRASS WE COULD
Line_4629	UM WELL THE PEN IN VARIABLE WOULD BE LIKE YES SWITCH ONE VARIABLE AT THE TIME
Line_4630	THANK YOU
Line_4631	UH WE OUT OF TIME I NOT
Line_4632	PUT I BEEPED IT ON THE T BELL AND SWUNG IT FIFTY TIMES
Line_4633	O YEAH TO PE AN NUMEGRAPF
Line_4634	HELP YOU WITH THE MASSES
Line_4635	SWANG LIKE OH IN SWING
Line_4636	LUSTER
Line_4637	LI STRAINED WILL GO LONGER I THINK
Line_4638	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4639	IN SCIENCE I COULDN'T THINK ANY SO I DON'T CHANGE ANY
Line_4640	T WAS ABOUT TESTING YERRPPER'S TO SEE HOW ARE IT WENT
Line_4641	THE ANGLE AND THE DISTANCE THE FLUW
Line_4642	UM THAT THE BALL ON THE TOP IS BIGGER AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS SH
Line_4643	IT SAYS THAT THEY BOTH MEANS ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4644	THE ANGA E
Line_4645	OBJECT AND MASS LENGTH DISTANCE AND THE ANGLES
Line_4646	UH OKAY
Line_4647	BECAUSE MAYBE OTHER THINGS WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE GRAM
Line_4648	I DO AND DIFFERENT THINGS EVERY TIME
Line_4649	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4650	WE WERE DOING THE PLAINS AND MAKING A DRAFT AND TESTING THEM
Line_4651	STRING WITH PAPER CLIPS AND THEN PUT A PENNY
Line_4652	SSSTRING PAPER CLIP AND PENNY
Line_4653	I NOTICED THAT THE SMALL ONES DID THE MOST
Line_4654	THE BIG ONE DID THE LESS I MEAN DID THE MEDIUM
Line_4655	NOT SHARP I HUH
Line_4656	STRAINED PAPER CLIP A PENNY
Line_4657	LONGER OR SHORTER STRING
Line_4658	LONG OR STRIKE STRING
Line_4659	SMALLER OR DIFFERENT PAPER CLIPS
Line_4660	SMALLER PENNY SMALLER KIND OF COIN OR PAPER CLIP OR MORE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4661	A PENDULUM WITH STRING PAPER CLIPS AND PENNY AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
Line_4662	LIFE OR BOTS
Line_4663	THEY ARE MADE OF A CUPS
Line_4664	THEY'RE MADE A BOAT THEY'RE MADE OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4665	WE GOT PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT A DICTIONARY AND W WE
Line_4666	WE MADE LINES ON THE CUP AND WE CUT WHERE THAT WAS TO MAKE BOTH
Line_4667	MALL EATING BEAK
Line_4668	FER BOAT'S
Line_4669	PUTTING DIMES OR PENNIES FOR PASSENGERS IN THE BOAT
Line_4670	FOR MY DOTS SMALL WAS SEVEN MEDIUM BIG WAS TWENTY FIVE TO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4671	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_4672	PASSENGERS IN A BOATS
Line_4673	THE ONE THE TWENTY HAS MORE THAN THE ONE THE TWELVE
Line_4674	BOATS WITH PASSENGERS S PENNIES
Line_4675	MAKE IT AN EXCTURAL BOAT
Line_4676	MAKE IT BIGGER A CAMPACITY
Line_4677	OOD
Line_4678	MEASURING THE MASS AND THE VOLUME OF THINGS I
Line_4679	FIFTY MILLILITERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SMALLER CIRCUIT
Line_4680	A GRADUATED ILINDER
Line_4681	IT GOES UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE STRAND IT ONLY GOES UP TO FIFTY
Line_4682	SO LIKE IF YOU PUT WATER IN YOU'LL KNOW HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER YOU HAVE
Line_4683	YOU MEASURED THE VOLUETE OF THINGS
Line_4684	THE- THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4685	DON'T KNOW
Line_4686	WELL FIFTY MILLILITERS IS A
Line_4687	WHATA IS CAPACITY
Line_4688	IT HOLE AM THE CAPACITY OF IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4689	WE DON'T DO A MEASURET OF WATER WITH THREE CUPS
Line_4690	HOW HOT OR COLD THE WATER IS
Line_4691	WHAT IS THE HARDEST WHAT IS THE COLDEST
Line_4692	UM KNOWING S THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_4693	WELL YOUR FINGER CAN'T TELL THE EXACT TEMPERATURE BUT A A THERMOMETER CAN
Line_4694	WHAT A STANDARD TOOL
Line_4695	SALCIUS AND FAIR IN HEIGHT
Line_4696	WELL YOU COULD USE FAIR AND HOW YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO USE SELF SO YES UNLESS YOU LIKE NEED TO
Line_4697	GOT THE COLDER
Line_4698	WELL IT'S FIFTY DEGREES SALTS AND IT'S MORE MAR THAN TEN DEGREES CEL
Line_4699	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT CAN'T BE HIHER THAN FIFTY
Line_4700	WELL A HUH
Line_4701	UH ABOUT WET
Line_4702	WELL EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR F THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_4703	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVED MEANS
Line_4704	HUH OKAY
Line_4705	WE I USED THE CHART
Line_4706	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WITH THE ICE IS IT
Line_4707	ING HOTTER IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE GETTING COLDER AND IT MIGHT BE GETTING HOTTER
Line_4708	IT DROPPED WEATADLY
Line_4709	OH I W
Line_4710	PELLYBUB JOB BILLY BILLY HI HI
Line_4711	YEAH IT DOES
Line_4712	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4713	A BOUT MEASURING THINGS
Line_4714	UM IN CLASS WE USED STRAWS WHICH WAS KIND OF A HARD
Line_4715	I THINK MY FRIEND NICKO IS MAYBE A METER I THINK
Line_4716	TO THE IT IT'S LIKE THE DOORKNOB FROM A DOOR YOUR NECK IS REALLY SHORT
Line_4717	YOU COULD YOU COULD USE YOUR UM YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4718	KIND OF LIKE GUESSING
Line_4719	YOU SPREAD YOUR HAND APART WITH YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUM
Line_4720	UM NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4721	MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE AND LIKE EXACT
Line_4722	I AM HOW ARE YOU
Line_4723	I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_4724	UM MOST LIKELY A METER STICKS
Line_4725	I NOT SURE
Line_4726	TO MAKE SURE LIKE YOU PUT IT YOU HAVE IT STRAIGHT METAL LIKE FAST AND FOLDED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4727	WE MEASURED OUR ARMS OUR RISCT TO OUR ELBOW OUR FOOT AND OUR HEIGHTH
Line_4728	WE IN MEASURE OUR NOSIS
Line_4729	MAYBE A FOOT W
Line_4730	YOU ARE USING YOUR PINKIE FOR EACH CENTIMETER
Line_4731	I ON THE ONE
Line_4732	NONE OF THEM WERE THE SAME FOR ME AT LEAST MAYBE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE SOME ARE THE SAME
Line_4733	THAT HIS ARM S AND HIS HEIGHT ARE THE EXACT SAME
Line_4734	SOME ARE BIGGER THAN ANOTHER BODY PARTS AND SOME ARE SMALLER
Line_4735	UH TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4736	O COULD USE YOUR THUMB AND YOUR PINKIE TO MEASURE TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4737	UM A PENCIL
Line_4738	ELL UM M JUST LIKE STOPPED RIGHT THERE
Line_4739	THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE IT DEPENDS OFF ON HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4740	THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT LIKE THEY WEIGHS DIFFERENT SIZES YEAH
Line_4741	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4742	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4743	ONE'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IF IT'S HEAVIER IT LEANS IF IT'S LIGHTER IT DOESN'T LEARN IT STAYS UP
Line_4744	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4745	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4746	THAT ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER AND ONE OF THEM IS SMALLER
Line_4747	UM THERE IS TWENTY FIVE GRAM THERE IS TEN GRAM ERS TWENTY GRAM IS ONE GRAM
Line_4748	GOOD BYE I HAVE TO GO
Line_4749	IT I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4750	HUH I
Line_4751	IT'S ABOUT LIKE TWENTY GRAMS AND YEAH JUTS ABOUT GRAMS
Line_4752	M THE THE WASHER THE METAL CHIP AND THE WOOD CHIP
Line_4753	TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS THE OBJECT OBJECT THAT YOU WRITING IS
Line_4754	NOT I UM NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4755	THAT UM
Line_4756	UM YOU WOULD
Line_4757	-ERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAMS FOR FOR IT TO BE THE SAME MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_4758	I I THINK IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED
Line_4759	YOU WEAK MASS AND STUFF
Line_4760	THAT UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4761	UP
Line_4762	UM I DON'T KNOW AMOUNTS EXACTLY SURE
Line_4763	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4764	ITS SPONGES DRY WET AND SOAKED
Line_4765	THE SOAK SPUNGLE IS REALLY HEAVY
Line_4766	IT'S JUST A DRY SPONGE IT'S A DRY SPONGE IN A CUP HEAVIER THAN NOTHING
Line_4767	IF YOU DON'T KNOW W OR IF YOU DO KNOW
Line_4768	THAT A WET SPONGE IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN UH
Line_4769	UM IT'S IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER'S S PUNCH IT'S LOT HEAVIER
Line_4770	UH IT WAS IT WAS
Line_4771	I KNOW OR WOW WE REMEMBER AS USUAL
Line_4772	NOT EXACTLY SHARP
Line_4773	UM NOT SURE
Line_4774	THERE IS NOTHING INSIDE OF THE M
Line_4775	HAT GOT SKIPPED YESTERDAY
Line_4776	HELPS US
Line_4777	THERE A R
Line_4778	THE WATER AND THE CUP WELL THE VOLUME THE VOLUME IN THE CUP
Line_4779	POURING IT INTO A DIFFERENT CUP LIKES DROPS LITTLE DROPS
Line_4780	YEAH THEY'RE ABOUT
Line_4781	S TALKING ABOUT THEM JUST MILLIMETRE LILLIMMILLIMETERS MILLITERS
Line_4782	TEN TEN MAMA LITER
Line_4783	THE SEEING HOW MUCH MILLILITERS YOU UM WATER AND YOUR CUP
Line_4784	UM I'M MUSH
Line_4785	ER A LEADER OR NO UM UM A RULER I THINK
Line_4786	IT'S A SYRINGE WITH WATER IN IT AND IT'S GOT A SQUEESE OUT WATER
Line_4787	LOOK AT THIS YOU WOULD LOOK AT THIS SERENGE BECAUSE IT SHOWS ON THE SERENGE
Line_4788	IT REPRESENTS THE MILLIMETERS AND THAT'S ON THE STRING
Line_4789	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETERS AND LITERS AND STRANGE AND LIKE GRADUATED SILINDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4790	UM IT WAS LIT I CAN REMEMBER
Line_4791	WHAT IT ENDED UP BEING A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4792	T SHOWS HOW MUCH MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE I GUESS
Line_4793	A GRADUATED ILINDER
Line_4794	YOU MEASURE WA WELL YOU MEASURE MILLILITERS IN
Line_4795	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4796	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT
Line_4797	JUST BY LOOKING AT IT AND FIGURING OUT
Line_4798	YOU COULD JUST RIGHT THAT AB Z D ON A CUP AND E YAM NOT SURE
Line_4799	THAT THE FIRST CUP A THE FIRST CUP IS BIGGER HAS MORE WATER THAN THE SECOND CUP
Line_4800	THAT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU HAVEN
Line_4801	JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUIDS
Line_4802	R WIRES
Line_4803	UM I THINK IT KEEPS FUEL
Line_4804	THEY WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT LIKE KINDS OF VOLUME MEASURE M
Line_4805	THAT IT'S FATTER BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME MASS OF VOLUME OR YEAH VOLUME
Line_4806	THAT IF YOU TIE OR COLD BECAUSE YEAH IT'S UH OR COLD
Line_4807	WHICH ONE IS THE HOTTEST OR WHICH ONES IS THE COLDEST OR ONE OF THOSE
Line_4808	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4809	YOU FEEL DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF SALCYIGHTEN FAIR NIGHT SALCIIS AND FAIR NIGHT
Line_4810	I THINK IT'S A THERMOMETER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME BUT I THINK
Line_4811	UM LIKE I ROAD DOWN TWENTY
Line_4812	THINK NOTHING REALLY THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I
Line_4813	IT'S ABOUT HOT NOT COLD I THINK I OH SURE
Line_4814	GETTING THE ANSWER OF SALIUS
Line_4815	B CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF TOOL YOU USE IN THE UNIT TEMPERATURE
Line_4816	THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THE SAME
Line_4817	IT TURNS IN TO FAR IN HEIGHT
Line_4818	THAT THE FIRST ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A HUNDRED SALCIS AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIFTY FIVE SALIS
Line_4819	THAT THE SECOND ONE IS A LOT COLDER THAN THE FIRST ONE
Line_4820	THAT IT'S LIKE COUNTING BY TENS LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY
Line_4821	UM E THE THERMOMETER GOES DOWN I GUESS
Line_4822	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER MAYBE
Line_4823	THAT IT GOES FROM UM FROM IT'S FROM FIVE TO SIX TO NINE AND THEN TO THIRTEEN
Line_4824	THERE WAS A HUNDRED MINTS A HUNDRED MINUTES I GUESS
Line_4825	THE INFORMATION FROM THE OTHERS CHART THAT WE ACTUALLY USED TO RIGHT ON
Line_4826	TEMPERATURE AND MINUTES THAT IT IS FROM
Line_4827	THE TEMP THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN AND CHANGED TO AGREES SALCIIS
Line_4828	YOU COULD ESTIMATE OR STICK YOUR FINGER AND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4829	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER AND GUESS WELL YOU WELL JUST YEAH BYE JUST BY LOOKING AT IT
Line_4830	IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE THERMOMETER OR THE NUMBER LINE
Line_4831	THAT IT TURNS COLD TO IT TURNS PRETTY COLD AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE GREEN S ICE
Line_4832	THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE E YEAH
Line_4833	THIS THERMOMETER TELLS YOU UM TA TEMPERATURE CHANGED
Line_4834	IN T BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER
Line_4835	THAT IT'S DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND EACH ONE E
Line_4836	UM THE WATER IS GETTING HOTTER AND COLDER
Line_4837	US READY
Line_4838	UM A DOING A ROSE AND MY MATH
Line_4839	H I DON'T KNOW
Line_4840	THE VOLUME OR HOW MAG OR TOE IS
Line_4841	IT'S HOW UHM LONG IT IS FROM LIKE THE FRONT TO THE BACK
Line_4842	IT TELLS ME HOW UM MONGMETA IS A CROSS
Line_4843	O THE THE LENGTH OF THE IS
Line_4844	I WAS THE STRAWS AND THE MEASURING TAPE
Line_4845	MEASURING HOW H UM LONG UM
Line_4846	SOME WERE SMALLER AND SOME WERE LARGER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND UHM
Line_4847	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
Line_4848	SOME AR SOME ARE SHORTER AND UM GROUP A IS UM LONGER THAN GROUP B BECAUSE UM
Line_4849	IT MEANS THAT IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU THINK
Line_4850	THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME AND IN EACH GROUPS
Line_4851	UM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE UM THE SAME THING ON EACH GROUP
Line_4852	I UM GOT SOME WATER INSIDE THE SYRINGE AND THEN I UM PUSHED IT OUT INTO THE CUP
Line_4853	I CAN USE A TREE
Line_4854	HE CAPACITY IS UM A HUNDRED
Line_4855	THERE IS A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4856	THEY ALL MEASURE UH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4857	IT'S TWO MELLITERS UH WATER
Line_4858	THEY'RE BOTH US THEY'RE BUILD TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_4859	THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH THE UM CUP CAN HOLD
Line_4860	IT'S HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL
Line_4861	WE UH MEASURED
Line_4862	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILUTALS IN CAPOCITY
Line_4863	ITS SAID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_4864	IT UM THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS SOLUTE POOLIC GOOD
Line_4865	IT IT WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_4866	THEY'RE VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT T
Line_4867	LIGHT BULB WITH UM TEN MILLO LITERS BY UM EACH FOR EACH LINE
Line_4868	I WOULD USE THE CAPACITY IN MILLA LITERS S
Line_4869	YOU I I TH
Line_4870	I I UM WENT
Line_4871	B WAS COLDEST A WAS UM A LITTLE MORMER AND SEE WAS ARE MASHED
Line_4872	WE UHM CUP IS HOTTEST AND WHICH CUP IS COLDEST
Line_4873	UM A IS THE SAME AS S AND UM B IS ZERO DEGREES SALT S
Line_4874	IT'S HOW HOT OR CLOSE SOMETHING
Line_4875	IT'S A THERMOMETER AND UM IT CAN UM FEEL HOW UM HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4876	M MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD SOME LIQUIDS ARE
Line_4877	THE THERMOMETER AS MORE ACCURATE
Line_4878	IT'S DEGREES SELLS SEIS
Line_4879	SELLS SEE S ER FERRIN HEIGHT
Line_4880	THE MIDDLE OF FIFTY DEGREES ELCUS IS TEN AND TEN DEGREES ELCUS IS THIRTY DEGREES ALCIS
Line_4881	OOD
Line_4882	ITS UM IT DROPS THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4883	I SAW THAT IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER THEN UM EVERY MINUTE IT WAS UM MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_4884	IT HAPPENED EVERY ONE MINUTES
Line_4885	IT WAS UM TWENTY DEGREES TO FIVE DEGREES
Line_4886	IT JUST STAYED ON THE TREES BUT IT NEVER WENT NEXT UP
Line_4887	THE TEMPERATURES AND UM THE TIME OR MINUTES
Line_4888	UM THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4889	IT'S GETTING MUCH BIGGER
Line_4890	IT DROPPED UM FIFTEEN DEGREE TS
Line_4891	COMING THE LINES ON THE WEIGH
Line_4892	WELL IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET WATER OUT OF TH CUP SALTS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH POR
Line_4893	WELL IT GOES TEN MILLI MILLILITORS TWENTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLILITERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4894	WELL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS TOOLS BUT MY GUESS IS TO
Line_4895	GOING IT THROUGH BY FILLING IT TO THIRTY MILL
Line_4896	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I KNOW THIS MORNING
Line_4897	UH MARNEY EASILY SAID TO YOU I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS I KNOW I NEED TO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4898	I DO GO MARNEY CIMFROLLAN YEA BY
Line_4899	IT'S HOW MUCH WATER A CUP OR SOMETHING CAN HOLD
Line_4900	THAT THERE IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS FOR THE CAPACITY
Line_4901	NE MARNEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_4902	UM SO ARE YOU ASKING WHAT DID I DO WELL WHAT HELD MY GROUP TO OR WHAT TO DO
Line_4903	THAT TOWS HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE FAN IS UM YEAH
Line_4904	UM WELL
Line_4905	OKA HEY MARNING I HAVE TO GO NOW KA
Line_4906	AND SO AFTER WE STUCK OUR FINGERS IN THE AND THE WATER OF THE CUP WE
Line_4907	WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS
Line_4908	I KNOW THAT LIKE HOW HOT OR HOW COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4909	WE PUT IN THERMOMETERS UM SO WE PUT IN THE THERMOMETERS OR E
Line_4910	I CAN'T TELL WHAT THAT THE WIT BE IS BUT
Line_4911	UM THAT SEE MEANS SELCIUS
Line_4912	WELL MMM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4913	WELL I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SACS REALLY MEANS YEA WE'VE JUST START IT OUT STARTED IT OR TEMPERATURE UNIT SO
Line_4914	OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARNEY
Line_4915	UM YOU DON
Line_4916	LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE SAY FIVE DEGREES VERY HIGH BUT YOU LOOK AT THE RED STUFF THAT GOES UP
Line_4917	UM WELL THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE RIGHT OR HIGHER THAN THE ONE'S ON THE LEFT
Line_4918	OH I DON'T ALL RIGHT I COULD SAY I'M GOOD
Line_4919	WE'VE BEEN ASURING TEMPERATURE
Line_4920	THE ICE MADE THE WATER COLD
Line_4921	IN SO WE PUT THE ICE CUBES IN THAT MADE THE WATER MUCH MORE COLDER THEN IT WAS
Line_4922	BECAUSE FIVE DEGREES CALCIUS
Line_4923	AH UM SO THEY CAN GET SUPER COLD AND TURN TO ICE CUB
Line_4924	UH AND SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL TEMPERATURE VERY WELL
Line_4925	AND SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN MAYBE A PEN OR PENCIL AND THEN YOU CAN RIGHT YOUR RESULTS ON THE PAPER
Line_4926	WELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID MARNEY UM I
Line_4927	WE DIDN'T REALLY DRAW OUR DATA BUT WE ROOT OUR DATA
Line_4928	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ABOUT GRAPHS MARNEY
Line_4929	W WE PUT LIKE UM
Line_4930	THAT'S A MINUTE THAT IT TOOK EVERY TIME WE MEASURED
Line_4931	IT'S BECAUSE THEY MEASURED IT LIVE TIMES AND THEN THE TENTRECIUP TEMPERATURE CUP CHANGING A LITTLE
Line_4932	I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARNEY
Line_4933	WE OBSERVED CHANGES MAYBE FOUR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES
Line_4934	UM I DON'T I I DON'T KNOW A LOT LOT MONEY
Line_4935	WELL I CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT I ROYGHT DOWN MARNEY
Line_4936	I THINK IT WAS LIKE MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES SO F
Line_4937	MARNEY I'M JUST SAY GO BYE NO BYE BYE
Line_4938	HOWEVER MY IT CAN JELLY WHAT'S YOURS PROVERUBDAH AH DRINK THE LE
Line_4939	YES I DO C FOR POLE AND MIL YOUR HEAD
Line_4940	UM LESS ON
Line_4941	NO YOU DID NOT LEAVE YOUR SELVES
Line_4942	Y YES I DO GET THAT
Line_4943	UM WELL WE'VE JUST STORED IN TO UNIT ABOUT MEASURING THE METRIC SISTOM AND BEFORE THAT WE WERE DOING GIEOMETRY
Line_4944	I I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LENGTH IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4945	THEY WERE DIFFERENT SIDES SIZES SHOW EVERYONE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_4946	I S UM I'M NOT EXACTLY SO WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_4947	I AM GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU FOR A ASKING
Line_4948	UM THE FLOW UP TO DON UHM
Line_4949	THEY ARE ALL THE METRIC THEY'RE ALL UNIT TO THE METRIC ISTOM
Line_4950	EVERY PLACES AT THE UNITED STATES USES THE METRIC SYSTEM TO MEASURAL STUFF
Line_4951	UM I DO NOT KNOW W I
Line_4952	WHAT YOU COULD ESTIMATE ESTIMATE WHAT IS BACILY LIKE A MAKEOURE VILLY SMART GUESS
Line_4953	UM I IT'S TEN INCHES
Line_4954	SO SEND SOTY INCHES WIDE AND TWENTY INCHES UM TALL
Line_4955	INCIS
Line_4956	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4957	UM TO MIX WELL THEY GOT THE LIGHT AND SOIL
Line_4958	A GET THAT BETTER WHATEVER YOU PATH DISTIN DOWNS
Line_4959	BECAUSE YOU KEEP BEEN DOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER GET SO YOU HAVE TEN BETTER EACH TIME
Line_4960	M SO YOU I'M NOT IT'S ACTUALLY SOR
Line_4961	GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4962	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4963	THAT IS A THAT IS A QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_4964	MAY YOU MEASURE IT MORE THAN ONCE ES UM IT WON'T MAKE SAL THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSL
Line_4965	YOU'RE PINK THE PINK THE PINK IS ONE STAMETO
Line_4966	IT IS ONE CENTIMETALL WIDE
Line_4967	YE UH DON'T MO
Line_4968	I NOT SO
Line_4969	THEY ARE BOTH THE THINGS LIKES
Line_4970	THEY ARE UM MOST THE SAME LIGHT'S
Line_4971	UM SOME OF THEM ARE THE SAME IN
Line_4972	CIPTIMETER WO
Line_4973	THEY HAS CENT METALS ON THEM
Line_4974	I I I TOO MAN NO
Line_4975	I I AM GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4976	SO AND THEN Y ONE GOT CLOSE AROUND CLOSE TO THE SAME MANTLE AROUND THE SAME MEMBLE
Line_4977	AS THEY ARE MADE ARE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_4978	THAT THEY'RE MADE OF MAYBE
Line_4979	YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WHICH ONE'S HEAVIER
Line_4980	I I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4981	YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_4982	YOU ARE USING UM UH
Line_4983	OH I DON'T KNOW
Line_4984	THAT'S TEA CHICK DISK UM WE DISCUSSED UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4985	UM WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND DAMN
Line_4986	I DON'T KNOW ONE IS BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_4987	THEY WOULD BE DIFFERENT
Line_4988	EVERYONE DOES GET A DIFFERENT RESULT
Line_4989	UM I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
Line_4990	SO IN A CUBE AND IT SAYING IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_4991	I MEAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_4992	BYE TO BYE BYE
Line_4993	ELECTRIC CISTOM PUTSENTS
Line_4994	UM YOUR MEASURING WHAT THE THING WE'LL BULB TO HOW MUCH IT LEAVE
Line_4995	VENUALLY SOMETHING D
Line_4996	THAT WEIGH IT IT GRAMS ARE YOU PLEASE DON'T KNOW
Line_4997	I GOT YEAH
Line_4998	THE ALANCHE IS TOO HEAVY
Line_4999	HOW NOLLY
Line_5000	IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_5001	YOU'LL GET THE SAME MANTLE HOPEFULLY M
Line_5002	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_5003	EN FLAME IS THING
Line_5004	ME AM NO I
Line_5005	IT'S THEY IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_5006	IT'S STITRENCLAN
Line_5007	MANY TACKS
Line_5008	YOU THINK YOU HAVE HOW BEAK THAT METAL
Line_5009	H MEAN DON'T KNOW
Line_5010	UM ATOMS
Line_5011	LU P DON'T KNO-
Line_5012	HIT WILL NO YEAH
Line_5013	WHAT'S A LID A BO
Line_5014	UM WE DID NOT DO THE MEASUREMENT ONE'S ONE THOUSAND WHAT OF ALL
Line_5015	UM WHAT I DID YOU STICK
Line_5016	I HAD NEVER ACTUALLY USED THE A
Line_5017	HOW UHM I DON'T KNOW NO
Line_5018	UM UH WE TOLNED WHICH AGAIN
Line_5019	UM THERE ARE SO MANY HAVE HOLD THE JUSE
Line_5020	UM M UH WASTED YOU SAY
Line_5021	JEAEARLIAM I DID HEAR
Line_5022	A NUMBULB SAYING HOW MANY MILLILITRES IT IS
Line_5023	UM MMM POLITE
Line_5024	UM WE ARE CHEATING TO FREE HOW MUCH WATER WE'VE FILLED THE UP
Line_5025	I ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5026	UM I CAN MUMBUM
Line_5027	I FORGET WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE
Line_5028	WELL WE L GOD OUT AND THE CA CORD A INTO THE CUP
Line_5029	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY MILLALECOES ARE THERE
Line_5030	FIFTY MILLA LOADS
Line_5031	IT IT'S A HUNDRED MILALITALS IT'S VOLUME IT'S ONE HUNDRED MILLILITALIS
Line_5032	IT TELLS YOU IT'S EASILY LIKE THE CERTAIN IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IS IN IT
Line_5033	UM YOUR MAJOR STUFF UM YOU LIST IT THE VOLUME THAT THE STUFF F
Line_5034	UM DON'T KNOW WELL THE WINGS ARE BRAIN
Line_5035	I DON'T KNOW WHAT A CAPACITY IS
Line_5036	UM THEY HAVE LETTERS ON THEM MADE TO BEE
Line_5037	I WON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5038	THE STEEL IN UNDERSTAND CAPACITY IS
Line_5039	DON'T KNOW
Line_5040	UM I WE DIDN'T REALLY HEAR YOU
Line_5041	UM IT'S A NO
Line_5042	IT WAYS TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATELE
Line_5043	UM IT'S TWO HUNDRED MOMETERS A WATER
Line_5044	UM DEVON
Line_5045	I I DO NOT NOW
Line_5046	I TH SO THAT'S AN UBLI TO THE TOP
Line_5047	PLUBLUBL THAT'S WHAT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S JUST LYING THAT'S HOW YOU COME TO ME
Line_5048	IT'S SHOWING YOUR HOW MUCH SODA IS INSIDE OF IT
Line_5049	THREE HUNDRED MILLAYLITALS MAN HI MILLYLITA IS IN SIDE THE SODA IS THE MOON SODA INSIDE
Line_5050	WHAT DID YOU THINK
Line_5051	UM WELL THAT WAS JUST IT WAS TELLING YOU READ THE VOLUME OF THE CAN
Line_5052	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY UM
Line_5053	UM I NOTICE THAT'S NOW THE WAY FILTER TOP S
Line_5054	THEY THERE'S A SONG A GRADULITE A GRADUATED CANDLE AND A LID LE
Line_5055	UM YOU THINK OUT HOW MUCH HOW MUCH LOK AND SO S SOMETIMES
Line_5056	WHAT'S DO JE
Line_5057	UM UH ITS
Line_5058	UM OUT W WELL DO WON'T KNOW
Line_5059	UM THEY THE LAST FOR THEM IS DRIED UP
Line_5060	UM BOUT NO
Line_5061	HI MY NAME IS MIKE AND AIM NINE
Line_5062	MEASURING IS ABOUT UM LIKE MEASURING IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT MEASURING IS ABOUT
Line_5063	I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG THAT IS THE THING YOUR ASK ME TO MEASURE IS
Line_5064	I USED A STRAW AND THEN I USED A MEASURING TAPE WITH UM CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5065	YOU GOT UH MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWER SO IT WOULD BE REALLY BAD UM STRATEGY TO USE JAWS
Line_5066	HOW ARE YOU I'M VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_5067	IN MATH WE'VE BEAN DOING MALACHATION AND DIVISION
Line_5068	UM YOU MEASURE STUFF WITH METERS AND S THAT'S PACICALLY ALL OF IT LIKE YOU JUST MEASURE STUFF
Line_5069	M BECAUSE IF YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER
Line_5070	UM MINE THE HEIGHTS OF MY DISC
Line_5071	UM FROM THE GROUND TO THE DOORKNOB
Line_5072	THEY ALL HAVE CENTIMETERS IN IT
Line_5073	UM BECAUSE LIKE AND LIKE IT FORGET
Line_5074	YOU WOULD ESTIMATE BECAUSE YOU WOULD ESTIMATE
Line_5075	UM ESTIMATING IS A EDUCATED GUESS
Line_5076	IT IS THREES UNIT S
Line_5077	I FORGET
Line_5078	WU CAN KEEP PRACTICING AND THEN YOUR ESTIMATES WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER
Line_5079	YOU WOULD GET BETTER BECAUSE YOU WOULD JUST KEEP PACKED SWAYING AND YOU WOULD GET MORE USE TO IT
Line_5080	YOU USE A ROLLER A METER STICK OR A LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_5081	Y YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS
Line_5082	LIKE IT WOULD JUST GO THAT IT WOULD BE VERY RINKILLY SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY GET QUITE PRECISE ANSWER
Line_5083	TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKES SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT
Line_5084	I FORGET I THINK I
Line_5085	UM MMM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5086	YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS OUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT
Line_5087	THE PERSON IS MEASURING THIS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5088	ITS TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5089	UM IT'S FI I DON'T KNOW
Line_5090	I MEASURED FROM MY WRIST MY ELBOWS
Line_5091	TH MY ARM SPAN AND MY HEIGHT
Line_5092	I SEE THAT HER NOSE IN HER EAR ARE THE SAME LENGTHS
Line_5093	AND GENERAL USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_5094	YOU WOULD YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON LIT
Line_5095	US USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5096	DON'T KNOW
Line_5097	THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER AND THEN IT GOES TO A DECIMETER AND THEN A CENTIMETER AND THEN A ME A MILLIMETER
Line_5098	YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER
Line_5099	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5100	YOU WOULDN'T MEAN TO T
Line_5101	I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
Line_5102	IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND SO THAT AN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5103	IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_5104	I YE DON'T KNOW
Line_5105	I FOURRRGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5106	YOU I DON'T MY I TING
Line_5107	FOR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5108	UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5109	BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH- MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_5110	I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIP WEIGHED ONE GRAM
Line_5111	WE USED PAPER CLIPS
Line_5112	THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACT TO FIGURE IT THE REAL ANSWER
Line_5113	THAT MIXTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUTE THAT IS WE TEN GRAMS
Line_5114	YU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THINGS
Line_5115	HM IT WAS ONE A GRAM
Line_5116	IT WAS AT GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISC WAS AT GRAMS
Line_5117	THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS S
Line_5118	IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHTH GRAMS
Line_5119	GRAMS ARE THE UM METRIC SISTUM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK
Line_5120	YOU CAN YOU ISN'T KNOW
Line_5121	YOU UM SO YOU HI CAN TELL ANYMORE I'M KIND TO SET IT UH
Line_5122	SO UM W I DON'T KNOW
Line_5123	IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5124	THE CARD IN THE PICTURE WEIGHS SEVENTY GRAMS
Line_5125	YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
Line_5126	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5127	A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOME THING'S LESS THAN A GRAM
Line_5128	ONE A THOUSAND
Line_5129	I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED GRAM
Line_5130	OU WOULD USE IT WHEN THERE LIKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND
Line_5131	YOU WOULD GET ER REALLY ACCURATE UM ANSWER
Line_5132	I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT A DRY SPONGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL GOBSORBED AND GET MUCH BIGGER
Line_5133	UH COKE SPONGE UM H I DON'T KNOW
Line_5134	THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE S SPONGE
Line_5135	IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ORBSORBING WATER
Line_5136	WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPUNGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPUNGAE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_5137	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE
Line_5138	I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE E CLOSES THREE GRAMS
Line_5139	YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT
Line_5140	I FOUND OUT THOUGHT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND UH THAT IT WAS DRAK
Line_5141	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPENGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5142	UM THIS I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UP UM THIRTY TWEN- GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5143	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED
Line_5144	M FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5145	YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MARS THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
Line_5146	YOU USES GRAMS
Line_5147	YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD YOU TAKE A P
Line_5148	IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BANG OR SMELL THE CUP IS
Line_5149	YOU CAN HEAR A VILE
Line_5150	I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST FILE IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND FILE
Line_5151	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE METRIC UM S ARE FOR MEASURING VOLUME
Line_5152	IT'S LEADER
Line_5153	U LITERS CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO MILLILITERS
Line_5154	MILLILITERS LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN UM MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER
Line_5155	I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM ONE HUNDRED MILLA LITERS ON THEM
Line_5156	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND A LITER
Line_5157	R ONE THAT SEND ONE THOUSAND MINILETLEITERS AND A LITER
Line_5158	TEN OF THEM MAKES UP A LITER
Line_5159	THE PLASTIC CUP W
Line_5160	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5161	UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND A I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5162	IT'S A CAN WITH M WATER IN IT
Line_5163	IT MAKES THEM GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN SUCK UP A PER VERY PRECIECE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5164	M THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REPRESENT
Line_5165	WE FIGURED OUT THE VOLUME BY USING A CURRENT AND A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5166	THAT OBJECT IS A SYRINGE AND IT HAS THOIRTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5167	THAT TWO IS A GRADUATED ILINDER
Line_5168	NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5169	YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER B YEAH
Line_5170	CAMPACITY IS THE AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPPY LIP TOP LIKE YEAH
Line_5171	I NOTICE THAT UM AT THE CUPS CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT
Line_5172	M DO NOT KNOW
Line_5173	IT'S WHEN YOU S IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE WATER
Line_5174	THERE'RE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS VESSELS
Line_5175	THE I DON'T NO
Line_5176	I OBSERVE THAT THE TALL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5177	I LEARN THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT S SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5178	I A WELL
Line_5179	IN MATH WE SAW WE TRIED TO SEE IF
Line_5180	I OBSERVED THAT IT'S A IT'S CAMPACITY AND IT'S CAMPACITY IS THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5181	YOU COULD USE WATER TO HELP FIGURE E THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5182	I NOTICED THAT THE LIQUID IS AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5183	THE PRINTED NUMBER A TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN
Line_5184	I HEAR NOT KNOW
Line_5185	OH I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5186	THAT IS THE CAMPACITY OF THE SODA CA
Line_5187	IT STANDS FOR THE CAPACITY OF THE CON
Line_5188	UH I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5189	I OBSERVED THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5190	THERE IS A SCREEN UH GRADUATED SILENDER AND UH LETTER UH LITER LIKE CUP THING
Line_5191	Y YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH UM LIQUID IS IN SOMETHING
Line_5192	WE USE THE METRIC CISTUM USES MILLILITERS AND RIGHT NOW AND SCHOOL WE ONLY USE MILLILITERS
Line_5193	YE YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED
Line_5194	IT IS DOING A MATH QUES N TO GET YOU TO YOUR ANSWER
Line_5195	SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5196	I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS I MEAN DOESN'T REALLY DISCOVER ANYTHING
Line_5197	YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CA CA ER CAP WATER WAS WARMER
Line_5198	YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATERS
Line_5199	I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS CLOSEST AND WHICH ONE IS SAND BETWEEN
Line_5200	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5201	I THINK ABOUT IS IS HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
Line_5202	WE PUT US SOME MOMENTER AND
Line_5203	YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHINGS
Line_5204	ITS WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH
Line_5205	FUN SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES
Line_5206	YOU YOU WE'RE USING CELSIUS AND THIS UNIT
Line_5207	IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GOES DOWN AND WHEN IT GOES DOWN
Line_5208	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5209	MU KNOW THAT I
Line_5210	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5211	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COOLER
Line_5212	WE ESTIMATE IT WITH OUR FINGERS
Line_5213	WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE AND THE WATER W
Line_5214	UHM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY
Line_5215	UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE ONE IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH
Line_5216	I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT MUCH COLDER
Line_5217	IT DROPS SLOWER
Line_5218	IT DROPPED FIFTEEN SELCEIS
Line_5219	THEY CAN FREEZES
Line_5220	IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE CONTRACTING AND SO YEAH
Line_5221	Y YOU CAN RIGHT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN
Line_5222	JUST PLAYED IT I RIGHTING IT ON IN A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5223	DR UM MA AND NUMBERS ON A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
Line_5224	I NOTICED THAT IN TEN MINUTES IT DROPPED DOWN THE FIVE DEGREES AND THEN IN
Line_5225	F THE PARTS OF THE GRAFT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_5226	GRASS ARE TO HELP YOU UM LIKE MEASURE AND KEEPS TRACKING OR STUFF
Line_5227	YOU PUT NUMBERS ON THE SIDE
Line_5228	IT HELPS YOU CAP TRACT OF LIKE TEN MINUTES IT'S FIVE DEGREES TWENTY MINUTES IT'S THIRTY DEGREES LIKE THAT
Line_5229	YOU CAN USE IT TO YET HIGHEST ARE ON MELT
Line_5230	I PUT LIKE HOW IT DROPPED I'M HOW HOW IT DROPPED IN TEMPERATURE AND HOW IT WENT UP IN TEMPERATURE
Line_5231	THEY HELP YOU THEY'RE ARE A LIKE ABOUT
Line_5232	IT ONE DOWN REALLY FAR AND TEN IT'S GOING UP
Line_5233	IT HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW HOW IT RISES IN TIME AND THEN HOW IT DROPS IN TIME
Line_5234	P OR TEN MINUTES
Line_5235	IT GOES UP AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5236	IT'S IT COLDER AND WIDER
Line_5237	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5238	AND THEN YOU WOULD S THEM TOGETHER AND GET YOUR ANSWER OF HOW M DIFFERENT IT WOULD
Line_5239	YOU CAN HELP THE D GREEKS CALCIIUS IT DROPED
Line_5240	UP WHEN IT EITHER GOES DOWN UM THE RED STUFF GOES DOWN ON A C THERMOMETER OR UP
Line_5241	UM THE TEMPERATURE IS CHANGING
Line_5242	HI MY NAME IS SOVI
Line_5243	YES I DON
Line_5244	IF I PRESS THE REPEAT BUTTON
Line_5245	YES IT DOES
Line_5246	UH MEASURING IS WHEN WELL
Line_5247	MEASURING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE HOW LONG SOMETHING IS SOR
Line_5248	IT WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_5249	ING IS THE
Line_5250	ARNIE I I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE
Line_5251	ONE IS LONGER THAN THE OTHERS BUT I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW
Line_5252	IN MATH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND WE ARE DOING A LOT OF FUN STUFF IN MATH
Line_5253	UM IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR TO THE DOOR KNOB
Line_5254	THEY'RE ALL FROM THE METRIC CISTUM
Line_5255	YOU CAN ESTIMATE
Line_5256	WELL SOMETIMES ESTIMATING IS JUST YE SAY
Line_5257	YOU CAN S WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5258	GUESSING HOW LONG WIDE OR THICK SOMETHING IS OR HOW TALL IT IS
Line_5259	ACTUALLY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5260	YOU CAN USE A MEASURED TAPE OR A RULER OR A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK OR A FEET OR INCHES
Line_5261	I YOU DO NOT KNOW
Line_5262	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS QUISION BUT
Line_5263	SO YOU CAN JUST DOUBLE CHECK TO MIXTURES YOUR RIGHT
Line_5264	IT WAS A VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND EASY
Line_5265	NAH WAIT
Line_5266	WELL UM SOMETIMES IT'S HEAR SOMETIMES YOU NEED A FRIEND TO HELP YOU BUT
Line_5267	FOR THAT I USED A MEASURING TAPE SO IT WAS EASIER THAN USING A METER STICKS
Line_5268	THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG
Line_5269	E IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG SO IF YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS LIKE THREE CENTIMETERS ONE
Line_5270	YESTERDAY WE MEASURED WHICH ONE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE LIGHTEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5271	THE I THE METAL DISC IS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5272	PLAYSTICK SHOULD BE LIGHTER THAN METAL
Line_5273	YOU WOULD MEASURE INSTEAD OF ESTIMATING
Line_5274	THE BALANCED AND MAR MESH AN
Line_5275	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5276	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_5277	IT SAYS THAT SOMETHING EQUALS ONE GROUPS
Line_5278	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5279	THAT'S THE THAT THE STUFF WE THE MATERIALS THAT WE USED WERE HEAVIER
Line_5280	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANY MEASUREMENT ON MASS
Line_5281	WE'VE BEEN USING THE METRIC CISTORM
Line_5282	THE LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD ON THE RIGHT CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS S
Line_5283	TELLS ME THAT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5284	WELL IF YOU PUT LET'S SAY
Line_5285	TWO GRAMS
Line_5286	YOU CAN ESTIMATE HOW TALL OR HOW MUCH THEY WE
Line_5287	WHAT A REFERENCE IS A YET
Line_5288	THEIR REFERENCES I'M GUESSING
Line_5289	TO BE MEASURED COMPLETELY STRONG
Line_5290	YOU NEED SEVENTY GRAMS TO MEASURE THIS CAR TO MAKE IT A COMPLETELY MEASURED
Line_5291	CAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SMALL GRAM PIECES AND IT WON'T MEASUREMENT STRITLY
Line_5292	MAYBE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW HOW HOW HEAVY IT IS FOR A RECIPY OR SOMETHING IN A COOKIE BOOK
Line_5293	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_5294	GET A ONE HUNDRED GRAM PEACE OR USE IT DIFFERENT THING THEN A A BALANCE MEAN
Line_5295	TWOO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5296	YOU S N I DON'T KNOW
Line_5297	THE GRAVEL IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAMS
Line_5298	SO THEY MEASURED EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5299	I I HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT KILOGRAMS YET
Line_5300	YOU USE IT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT'S TOO HEAVY TO USE FOR S GRAMS
Line_5301	HEAVIER THAN HEAVIER THAN A A BOOK
Line_5302	I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE MARNEY
Line_5303	IT'S DOING VERY WELL
Line_5304	WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING MUCH MEASUREMENTS BUT WE'VE BEEN BALANCING THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN USING A BALANCE
Line_5305	WELL IT'S DRY SO IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS A SPUNGE WITH THAT WAS WEST SO IT'S PRETTY LIGHT
Line_5306	UH WHAT SPUNGE IS A SPUNGE WELL UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5307	WHEN IT IN TO PULL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP
Line_5308	YOU PUT IT ON A BALANCE AND THEN USE KEEP ON PUTTING LE
Line_5309	UM THE THE DRESS SPUNGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S LEVELED OUT ON THE BALANCER
Line_5310	THE WET SPONGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE BECAUSE THE WET S SPONGE HAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT
Line_5311	THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5312	THE WET SPONGE IS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5313	UM THE THE WET SPUNGLE IS
Line_5314	THE SPONGE HELD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5315	CH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5316	RE GOOD I AM VERY VERY GOOD
Line_5317	WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH AN EMPTY CUP
Line_5318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5319	UH THAT THAT THE CUP CAN HOLD THAT MANY VIALS OF WATER AND SIDE OF IT
Line_5320	YOU COULD USE VIAL'S
Line_5321	N GROUP ONE IS BIGGER THAN GROUP TWO
Line_5322	IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS THEN OTHER PEOPLE
Line_5323	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT IN CLASS SO I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5324	IT'S JUST MARKING THE SPOTS
Line_5325	HERE IT'S ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS FILLED UP AND THAT
Line_5326	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE A LITER
Line_5327	OW MUCH WATER THERE ISN'T A CUP OR HOW MUCH JUST OR SOMETHING
Line_5328	-ERE IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5329	YOU COULD USE A CIRENGE
Line_5330	IT SAYS LIKE AT LITERS THIRTY EIGHT LITERS I MEAN MILLILITERS
Line_5331	UM WELL ACTUALLY YESTERDAY I WASN'T THERE FOR SO AND SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5332	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T SURE YESTERDAY AND SCIENCE S
Line_5333	I I DON'T KNOW HOW I FIGURED OUT VOLUME
Line_5334	WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT A SILANDER OR A SERVENCE
Line_5335	I THINK IT'S CALLED A SURRENGE
Line_5336	I DIDN'T USE A CYRINGE
Line_5337	I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A CYRINGE CAN HOLD
Line_5338	UH I DON'T KNOW I NEVER WORKED WITH THIS THE OTHER DAY SO
Line_5339	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT TOO L
Line_5340	I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD DESCRIBE THAT
Line_5341	WE COULD MEASURE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER B
Line_5342	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT I'M JUST GUESSING NOTHING
Line_5343	DON'T KNOW
Line_5344	HAT'S TOO HARD I DON'T KNOW
Line_5345	ONE A HUNDRED FIFTY
Line_5346	UM THE SECOND CUP DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER AND IT AS THE FIRST CUP
Line_5347	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5348	THE SODA INSIDE OF THE SODA CANS ONLY FILLS UP TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_5349	YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA CAN AND IT SAYS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF SODA IS IT HERE
Line_5350	Y YOU NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT'S ONLY FILLED MOSTLY TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL THE WAY
Line_5351	TH PRINTED NUMBER IS TELLING YOU THAT THE AMOUNT OF SODA THAT IS IN THAT CAN IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5352	THERE IS A WELL THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF LIQUID INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5353	THE LIQUID OF THE VOLUME IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5354	CAPACITY OF THE CAN IS THREE HUNDRED
Line_5355	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT OR THE SAME
Line_5356	THERE IS A SYRINGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THING IN THE MIDDLE IS A BUT THE CUP IS ONE LITER
Line_5357	M THERE IS NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MAKES ONE LITER
Line_5358	I WOULD USE A SYRINGE INSTEAD OF SOMETHING ELSE
Line_5359	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO THAT BUT MARNEY I'M GOING TO GO NOW BYE-BYE
Line_5360	IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST ON WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5361	UH ONE IS WARMER OR HOTTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5362	TO SEE HOW HOT COLD OR WARM SOMETHING IS S
Line_5363	BECAUSE FINGERS DON'T WORK
Line_5364	ITS MEASURES THE WEIGHT OR TEMPERATURE OR LENGTH OF SOMETHING
Line_5365	I THINK THE UNITS COAT SLCIUS
Line_5366	I DON'T KNOW THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION UH MAYBE LATER I WILL
Line_5367	THAT IT'S NOT AS COLD SHOT I MEAN
Line_5368	HOT WATER IS WARMER THAN ICE WATER BECAUSE ICE IS IN THE WATER
Line_5369	A SO IN THIS PICTURE YOU'RE POR AMED
Line_5370	WELL YOU'RE POURING ICE WATER AND TO WARM WATER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO GET
Line_5371	IT WOULD GET WARM AND COLD THE ICE WATER WOULD MAKE THE WARM WATER COLDER BUT THE WARM WATER WOULD MAKES THE ICE WATER WARMER
Line_5372	Y YOU COULD ESTIMATE
Line_5373	WELL I NEVER F FIGURED THAT OUT
Line_5374	IT'S DOING VERY GOOD
Line_5375	IT GETS A HOLDERS
Line_5376	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER FAIR IN HEIGHT OR SLCIIS
Line_5377	WELL WHEN I GET IT I USED A THERMOMETER I
Line_5378	IT'S A LITTLE SQUARES IT'S GOT THE AREA AND THE UM
Line_5379	DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YEAH
Line_5380	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5381	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THAT IS
Line_5382	IT'S GOING DOWN OR UP
Line_5383	SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES OR NO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES
Line_5384	UM A COUPLE OF MINUTES
Line_5385	YOU COULD USE THE THERMOMETAR OR YOUR FINGERS THINK YOUR FINGERS AREN'T THE BEST UM WEIGHT TWO BUT IT IS ONE WAY
Line_5386	TWO SELCIES DOWN
Line_5387	WE LOOKED AT IT AND THEN WE RECORDED IT ON A PAPERY
Line_5388	YOU COULD READ THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE THEM MARKS BECAUSE THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5389	THEN THE UM THE RED PART GOES DOWN OR UP BUT IF IT STAYS THEN IT'S NOT CHANGE IT
Line_5390	WHATEVER IS IN THE WATER THE MA MATERIALS ICE HOT WATER THAT MAKES IT CHANGE
Line_5391	STUDYING MAGNETISM AND PLAYING WIDTH MAGNETS
Line_5392	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASS UM WE DID THIS EXACT SAME THING AND UM THAT HAPPENED
Line_5393	U WASHERS A D CELL AND RO THE METAL ROD
Line_5394	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT WON'T LET THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO A LITER
Line_5395	WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH CIRCUITS WITH BATTERIES WIRES AND MOTORS OR LIGHTS AND UH SWITCH
Line_5396	I PUT THE STRAW IN ROUND PLACE BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A STRIP OF METAL
Line_5397	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5398	I ACTUALLY JUST REMEMBER THAT ALUMINIUM DOES STICK BECAUSE IT IS A METAL JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
Line_5399	NO NOT EXACTLY IT JUST KEEPS PEOPLE SAFE FROM ELECTRICUTING THEMSELVES OR GETTING SHOCKED OR GETTING HURT
Line_5400	BRASS HOLE I MEAN WASHER AND A NOTHING ELSE
Line_5401	IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MAGNETS
Line_5402	WE'VE BEEN ELECTRICITY AND USING CIRCUITS AND THEN TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5403	THE BULBS ARE BOTH LAYING UP BUT IN OUR CLASS HEY WE COULDN'T GET HIM TWO
Line_5404	IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF NEGATIVE AND GOES INTO A POSITIVE AND SO IT TRAVELS THROUGH AND SO YEAH
Line_5405	IT ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE AND IT BUT NEGATIVE AND IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SO YEAH
Line_5406	THE BATTERY ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW BACK INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE S
Line_5407	LEARNING ABOUT THE WATER CYCLES
Line_5408	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5409	THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THROUGH THE PLENK OF WOOD
Line_5410	LU HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_5411	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5412	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_5413	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT
Line_5414	THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PAT IN A TWO TH TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
Line_5415	THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED D
Line_5416	THEN ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5417	ONE IS THE BATTERY AND A TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5418	I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE IS A NON FAIR WELL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS
Line_5419	THAT IF FIT THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE ON A HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5420	THAT IT IS A MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5421	THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5422	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER
Line_5423	WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5424	THE BULB S SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
Line_5425	POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5426	WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND WITH SAND ON THE NEGATIVE
Line_5427	THE LIGHT BULBS IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
Line_5428	IN HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_5429	IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT
Line_5430	THE CAN THE CON EAT
Line_5431	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_5432	A NAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5433	ALLY THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL
Line_5434	WELL THE MATERIALS THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
Line_5435	THEY ARE COVERED WITH A PLASTIC
Line_5436	I I HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINGING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS CAN STICK
Line_5437	UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU SLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRIED TO PUSH THEM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APART
Line_5438	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
Line_5439	THE MAGNETS FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
Line_5440	THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING R
Line_5441	WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER AND THAT MAKES HIM A STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES
Line_5442	MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING THEM S STICK TOGETHER
Line_5443	IT GOES THROUGH OTHER MATE ELSES
Line_5444	THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5445	IRON IRON METAL OR STEEL
Line_5446	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5447	ITS IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS FROM ONE BATTERY
Line_5448	WELL IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY ONE BATTER YEAH
Line_5449	THAT ONES CAN A TU F FOR ME
Line_5450	IT THE ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5451	WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T RIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_5452	THAT'S KIND A TUFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5453	THAT'S AN A TU F ONE FOR ME
Line_5454	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5455	UH THAT'S GONNA A TU F ONE FOR ME
Line_5456	ELL MIGRAPHOORE NEGUAR'S END INTO THE POSITIVE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
Line_5457	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
Line_5458	DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNEY
Line_5459	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M BRAIN ABOUT THAT MARNEY
Line_5460	THAT THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5461	THAT THERE IS ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY AND ONE'S S SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH IN THE BATTERY
Line_5462	WELL PART OF IT WRONG IT DOESN'T
Line_5463	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON S SO YEAH
Line_5464	THE ELECTRO MAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
Line_5465	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5466	IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_5467	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_5468	WELL THE FORM OF ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KIND OF CONNECT TO
Line_5469	THE RIVIC CAN STAY MAGNETIC UH FOR CRIGHT SOME TIME
Line_5470	WELL IN SCIENCE ELECTRO- MAGNET
Line_5471	ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5472	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETISM S THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5473	IT'S A MAGNET THAT ATTRACTS IT'S UM OPPOSITE AND DOES NOT ATTRACT IT'S UM IN
Line_5474	IT ATTRACTS THING AS WELL
Line_5475	IT'S ATTRACTING THINGS THAT ARE STEEL OR IRON S
Line_5476	UM IT DOESN'T DO ANY M IT DOESN'T STICK TO ANY MATERIALS THAT AREN'T STEEL OR IRON
Line_5477	UM THERE IS IRON OR STEEL THERE IS SOME ROCKS WOOD PLASTIC COPPER AND A SPONGE E
Line_5478	UM WELL THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE UM S UM MOSTLY METAL AND YEAH
Line_5479	I THINK THAT IRON AND STEEL IS A ROCK SO IT MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE CONTAINING A THAT A
Line_5480	YOU ASK ME THAT BYE UM IT IT STICKS TO IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY
Line_5481	UM MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL AND
Line_5482	UM THE S THE STEEL NAIL UM STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMINA NAIL DOESN'T
Line_5483	AND ALUMINIUM NAIL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_5484	UM THE ALUMINUM NAIL UM DOES NOT HAVE THE MATERIAL IN IT THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL DOES
Line_5485	UM I THINK THAT UM THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TOGETHER ARE A OPPOSITE SIDE AND THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER ARE
Line_5486	WORKING ON MAGNETS AND WATERS
Line_5487	UM THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS AND THE ONE SIDE THAT BIT OVER POWERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_5488	UM THE THE UM WASHERS R THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS THAT IT OVER POWERS TO A MAGNET
Line_5489	UHM THEY THEY STILL ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT
Line_5490	BLOCK THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5491	HERE'S STILL A BIT OF MAGNETIC FIELD THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS STRONG AS IT WAS WHEN I ONLY HAD LIKE A COUPLE OF SPACES
Line_5492	UM IT'S CALLED MAGNETIC FIELDS AND IT IT OPSOPSITS A TRACT AND UM THE SAME D CRAP D TRACTS
Line_5493	UM DORETY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_5494	TWO BULBS AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH TWO CIRCUIT S
Line_5495	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BRIGHTER AND ONE ON THE LEFT ISN'T BRIGHTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FORMATION
Line_5496	IT'S LIKE A DIFFER
Line_5497	UM IT'S BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANOTHER ELECTRO A BULBS
Line_5498	UM THERE'S THE ELECTRI- THEY'RE THE SIMBLE FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH THINGS
Line_5499	ITS TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULBS
Line_5500	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH BULB
Line_5501	M IT GOES THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND IT JUST KEEPS GO TRAVELING A CIRCUIT FOR EACH SIDE
Line_5502	IF ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S EACH BULB HAS A SEPARAT THING
Line_5503	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH AND IS GOING THROUGH A SEPARATE PATHWAY
Line_5504	PROBABLY C PARALLEL
Line_5505	LECTRICITY IS PRESEMBLED BY BLUE TRAVELING DOTS
Line_5506	UM I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5507	UM DO YOU MEAN A STRING OF CRISS LITES
Line_5508	UM THERE IS WASHERS THERE'S A D CELL BATTERY THERE IS A WIRE A SWITCH A HOLDERS AND THIS STEEL ROD
Line_5509	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TO IT IT ATTRACTS THINGS IF IT'S A MAGNET
Line_5510	UM IT'S AN ELECTRO MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STRONG
Line_5511	UM THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND
Line_5512	UM THE ELECTRO MAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5513	IT'S BASICALLY TURNING ON THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5514	IT PICKS UP THE WITH THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5515	IT'S CLOSED
Line_5516	UM SWITCH WHEN WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST ACTIVATES THE ELECTRICITY AND PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5517	UM THE BATTERY IS MAKING ELECTRICITY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5518	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ALL THE WAY SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN MAKES A FULL CIRCUIT AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5519	IT'S THE IT IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WHICH PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5520	UM WELL BASICALLY IT UNTIL THE BATTERY LINE RUNS OUT OR THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF
Line_5521	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL IN A FULL CIRCUITS

Line_5575	YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FUN ESPECIALLY HE MESSY ONES
Line_5576	THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHTBULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5577	UH THERE ARE TWO
Line_5578	BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BURN BRIGHTER
Line_5579	HE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD
Line_5580	TODAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK
Line_5581	TODAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A DEAD BATTERY
Line_5582	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS S SORT OF SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_5583	ONE IS A A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ANOTHER IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5584	EN IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_5585	UP IT HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5586	THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT
Line_5587	IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT UHM THEN UHM NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_5588	WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN I CLICKED ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T BURN OUT
Line_5589	UM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH PRETTY MUCH CONNECTED TO THE UM D CELLS
Line_5590	PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF ONE BULB LIGHTS OUT BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_5591	THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT AS WELL AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_5592	UM WANT ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5593	UM THERE WAS A A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT
Line_5594	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5595	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING AROUND OR ELSE THE ENERGY WON'T REACH THE MAGNETS SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_5596	IF YOU TURN IT IF YOU CLOSE THE SWITCH THEN IT'S SORT OF TURNS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON SORT LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_5597	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT IN A SORT OF IN A CIRCLE OR ELSE THE IT WON'T FLOW CORRECTLY
Line_5598	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5599	TEMPORARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG
Line_5600	M ACTUALLY IT HAS TO
Line_5601	ONE IS CONNECTED UM NOT IN CORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_5602	IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5603	IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A ROUTE
Line_5604	IT'S THE ENERGY SOURCE THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE W IRON TO CREATE ELELECTRICITY
Line_5605	I SEE A A D CELL A LIGHT BULB A REALLY SMALL LIGHT BULB AND SOME WIRES
Line_5606	THOSE ARE THE WIRES WHICH THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR START
Line_5607	UM WELL IT CHARGES THINGS
Line_5608	UM THE ENERGY IT COMES IN FROM ONE END AND UH COMES OUT IN THE OTHER
Line_5609	ITS IS UM
Line_5610	IT IS UM CHARGING THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR GOES AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH YE T
Line_5611	IT SHOES THE UM THE SIYMBLES
Line_5612	UM I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR
Line_5613	IF THEY WEREN'T UM NEXT TO THE M FOR THE MOTOR OR THE D CELL CIMBLES THEN IT WOULDN'T RUN
Line_5614	US THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5615	WE JUST FINISHED UM LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY AND CLASS RIGHT ON A COUPLE MINUTES AGO
Line_5616	THEN THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB SO UH THE LIGHT BULB CAN NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5617	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM ABOUT MAGNETS S
Line_5618	WELL THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER UM MAGNIC ATTRACTS EACH OTHER
Line_5619	UM GIVING EACH OTHER WAY THEY ARE REPELLING
Line_5620	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_5621	UM WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL SOR
Line_5622	WELL IF IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT BUT SO IF IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WON'T BURN OUT
Line_5623	THAT THE WIRES UM AREN'T LIKE REALLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_5624	IF THERE IS ANOTHER LIGHT BULB OR UM THEY OH BURNT OUT
Line_5625	UM WELL UH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FASTER IN THE PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5626	WELL IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FAST IT'S FASTER THEN THE SERIOUS CIRCUIT
Line_5627	ES MORE ELECTRICITY MORE POWER
Line_5628	MORE POWER THAN A SERIOUS CIRCUIT
Line_5629	BUT IT HAS MORE UM WIRES
Line_5630	ATHWAY AND FOR A PARALLEL IT'S TWO PATH WAI WHICH IS GIVING IT MORE POWER
Line_5631	WE'VE UH BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5632	THERE UM STUFF THAT ARE LIKE THAT S USE ELECTRICITY
Line_5633	THAT IT'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5634	ICE IT'S GIVING IT MORE POWER THE MAGNET MORE POWER
Line_5635	WHEN WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A KIND OF A UH MAGNET
Line_5636	YES UH MMM
Line_5637	M YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5638	I HAVE TO GO MARNEY I SEE YOU
Line_5639	I'VE BEEN STUDYIN ELECTRICITY
Line_5640	THEY'RE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY UM POWER TRAVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5641	THAT HE HAS POWER SIDE IT
Line_5642	HE HAS A LOT OF ENERGY UH
Line_5643	UM THE BATTERY IS UM ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND GIVING IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5644	IT'S DOING IN CIRCLES AND IT'S GIVING POWER TO THE MOTOR
Line_5645	WELL THE MOTOR HAS I FORGET TO BE RUNNING AND IT'S ELECTRICITY
Line_5646	WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WIRES EVERYTHING GOES LIKE IN CIRCLES
Line_5647	UM WELL E ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING SO IT'S CLOSED
Line_5648	HUH UM IT CARRIES POWER
Line_5649	IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY RUN AND IT LET'S THE MOTOR UM SPIN RUN
Line_5650	UM A CLOSED CIRCUITS UM GOING CIRCLES
Line_5651	IT'S OFF BECAUSE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING GIVING IT POWERS
Line_5652	I SEE AN M AND UM CIMBLES
Line_5653	WH IN ORDER TO LIKE THE BULB THERE NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER WIRE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WIRE IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5654	ER MADE A OUT OF METAL
Line_5655	NERGRY IS FLOWRING FLOWING THROUGH THEM
Line_5656	ECT THE WAY YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UH WHERE THE OTHER WIRE IS HITTING
Line_5657	NEED ENERGY TO FLOW IN ORDER TO ALIKE A BULB
Line_5658	VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5659	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5660	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY'RE SHARING THEY'RE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATATIVES
Line_5661	TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK INSTEAD OF ONE A LIGHT BULB WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5662	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AND COMING OUT THE SIDE
Line_5663	SORRY MARNEY A TO ALLOW
Line_5664	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETS
Line_5665	AN THE SAME SIDES ATTRACT
Line_5666	THEY'RE UM REPELLING E
Line_5667	THEY ARE UH THEY'RE REPELLING BE SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5668	THEY HAVE SO MUCH FORCE SO THEY JUST THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_5669	THE MAGNET IS PUTTING LOT OF FORCE IN THE NAIL SO THAT IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5670	UM IT IS HANGING FROM THE PAST IT THE PAPER CLIP IS HANGING HANGING FROM THE NAIL
Line_5671	WE'VE BEEN LIGHTING LIGHT BULBS AND D POWERING MOTORS
Line_5672	PARALLEL CIRCUIT WHEN LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM THE OTHER SUN KEEPS ON
Line_5673	WHEN A LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB STAYED
Line_5674	AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT E LIGHT BULBS UM UH ARE BRIGHTER
Line_5675	THERE ARE TWO UH WAIGHS
Line_5676	GOING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE D CELLS TO THE TOP
Line_5677	THIS SHOWS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5678	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5679	TOP LIGHT BULBS A BATTERY
Line_5680	IF IF IT BURNS IT MEANS THAT IT'S TWO THE BATTERY HAS TO MUCH
Line_5681	THE POWER'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5682	IN ONE THE BATTERY IS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE THE T THE BATTERY IS IN THE BOTTOM
Line_5683	IF I CLICK ON IT UM ONE TURNS ON AND ONE IN SO
Line_5684	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5685	IF THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTING TO BOTH THE M THE WIRE GOES OUT TWO AND THEY BOTH OH THEY BOTH BURN
Line_5686	THERE'S A THAT UM A
Line_5687	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5688	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING T THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5689	ER IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT AND SERIES IS ON THE LEFT
Line_5690	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT ONE THE OTHERS DO
Line_5691	AN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM UH
Line_5692	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE UM IT GOES BOTH WAYS AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY ONLY TRAVELS ONE WAY
Line_5693	THERE IS TWO UM THERE IS TWO WAYS FOUR AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_5694	HE ELECTRICITY ONLY GOES ONE WAY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_5695	IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5696	THE ELECTRICITY AND THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT TRAVELS BOTH WAYS AND A ELECTRICITY AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT TRAVELS ONLY ONE WAY
Line_5697	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN AND IT THE OTHER ONES WON'T BURNOUT
Line_5698	A SERY I MEAN PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5699	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5700	PUTTING A PAPER CLIP AROUND THE BOX AND THEN IF IT STICKY IF IT STICKS TO THE BOX THAT MEANS THERE IS THE MAGNET
Line_5701	N PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5702	WELL IT WAS KIND OF HARD TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE MAGNET WAS
Line_5703	IT'S LIKE MOVING AROUND
Line_5704	THEY SEPARATE
Line_5705	THE PAPER CLIP STARTED TO SPIN AROUND ONCE IT GOT CLOSER TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5706	THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLE ARE CONNECTING
Line_5707	IT'S STICKING TO THE BOX
Line_5708	CEP UM LIKE STICKING ONCE IT WHEN WE GOT CLOSER IT CEPT PULLING ITSELF ALL THE WAY TO THE MAGNET
Line_5709	IT LIKE CHEM
Line_5710	STUCK TO A BOX AND THEN IT DIDN'T FALL OFF SO WE KNEW THERE WAS A A MAGNET THERE
Line_5711	IT STARTED ATTRACTDING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5712	MOST OF THE IRON AN FIRELINGS ARE UM LINED UP AND SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE ALL MESSED CUP
Line_5713	IT HAS METAL AND IRON IN IT SO THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_5714	THEN NORIS CUEPED UM MOVING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5715	IS IS MADE FROM IRON SO IT MAKES IT STICK TO METAL
Line_5716	NORTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT AND NORTH AND NORTH END OR SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_5717	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BATTERIES
Line_5718	THOSE ARE WIRES THAT CONNECTED A BATTERY AND MOVED TO END IN
Line_5719	WELL THE BATTERY IS UM
Line_5720	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH 'EM
Line_5721	THEY BRING THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR WHICH POWERS THEY MOTOR
Line_5722	IN A CIRCUIT THE ENERGY IS TRAVELING ROUND AND AROUND
Line_5723	WITH CIRCUIT IT KIND I KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE A CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5724	IT KEEPS TURNING AROUND BECAUSE CIRCUIT KINDA SOUND LIKE A CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5725	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVE THINGY
Line_5726	UM IT'S GOING GREY NOT
Line_5727	IN SCIENCE RIGHT NOW I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5728	UHM SO THE THING WITH THE PLUS AND THE MINUS IS IS A BATTERY
Line_5729	UHM THE THE RED THING IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5730	THE GREEN STUFF IS A WIRES
Line_5731	D CELLS POWER OBJECTS
Line_5732	THE THE BATTERY PROVIDES A AN ELECTRIC PATHWAY TO POWER A LIGHT BULB
Line_5733	IN SCIENCE I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND OTHER CIRCUITS
Line_5734	I THINK ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5735	THE CIRCUIT I SEE THERE IS A PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5736	THE LIGHT BULB IS FARTING TWO NO THE BATTERY IS FARTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT THE SAME TIME AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5737	THE BULB DOTS ARE CARRYING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULB UM POWERING IT
Line_5738	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IT'S COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF A BATTERY TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5739	I AM SEEING TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5740	BECAUSE IT HAS TO PATHWAYS
Line_5741	WELL THE CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT HAS IS A PARALLEL PATHWAY AND THE CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS A SERIES
Line_5742	UM YOU KNOW I
Line_5743	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
Line_5744	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_5745	WE'VE BEEN UM SEEING IF MAGNETS STICK ON S STUFF
Line_5746	US PAPER CLIPS AND UM
Line_5747	MAGNETS STICK TO LIKE SOIL MOSTLY EACH SOIL
Line_5748	WELL THE MAGNETS STICKING AND THEN THE MAGNETS IT'S NOT STICKING TO THE THE SAME MAGNET FOR SOME REASON
Line_5749	THE MAGNET STUCK TO THE ONE CAUSE THE CAUSE THE TWO SIDES UM AND ME WELL
Line_5750	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE ONE BUT THEN THE OTHER WILL GO ONE SIDE AND IF YOU FLIP THE MAGNET OVER THEN ONE OF THE SIDE WON'T STICK
Line_5751	WELL THE MAGNETS UM UH I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY ONE
Line_5752	I I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
Line_5753	CAN'T THINK OF ANY UM
Line_5754	THERE IT BOARDS THAT UM YOU LIKE PUT STUFF ON IT LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON YOUR DISC
Line_5755	UM YOU TRIED TO YOU PUT UM WIRES ON IT AND A MOTOR AND YOU TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE UHM WIRES ARE
Line_5756	THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTED UM TO D AND A
Line_5757	IT CONNECTS TO THESE UM I THINK THEY'RE BRASS THINGS OR THEY MIGHT BE STEEL
Line_5758	WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LITTLE BULB THINGS ON TOP
Line_5759	IT'S WIRE INSIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD
Line_5760	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH FOUR WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5761	WELL THE UM CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM UH I FORGOT WHAT A CIRCUIT WAS
Line_5762	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING BACK
Line_5763	THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY I THINK
Line_5764	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM ON THE D CELL I TH
Line_5765	THEY'RE UM LIGHT BULBS LIKE ARE BRIGHTER WHEN YOU WHEN THERE'S TWO BATTERIES BUT THEY'RE DIMMER WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE
Line_5766	IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHTER
Line_5767	UM I DON'T KNOW I BYE
Line_5768	I WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE TODAY SO I DON'T KNOW W
Line_5769	DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID BECAUSE THAT WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE
Line_5770	UM I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE TODAY
Line_5771	I CAN EXPLAIN IT I I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5772	MAGNETS AREN'T REALLY STICKING I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OF SPACERS
Line_5773	I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN'T OBSERVE ANY THING ELSE WHAT
Line_5774	I DON'T I CAN'T FORGET THAT S I DON'T KNOW
Line_5775	WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5776	WELL UM THE UM THE D CELL BATTERY IS LIGHTING THE TWO UM UH LIGHT BULBS
Line_5777	THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM BRIGHTER
Line_5778	THE BLUE DITCH IS THE UM ENERGY OR THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_5779	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5780	TWO CIMBLES ON THE SIDE EQUAL LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE TWO CIMBLES IN THE MIDDLE EQUAL Y UM BATTERY
Line_5781	IT MEANS IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5782	IT'S GOING REAL LIKE N I MEAN PRETTY OOD
Line_5783	I THOUGHT WHAT I FORGOT WHAT I WAS DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_5784	UM WELL IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE WEIGHT I FORGOT SORRY
Line_5785	WELL IF YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE D CELLS AND THEN YOU TOUCHED IT THE OTHER ENDS OF THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5786	WELL Y D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF UHM I FORGOT
Line_5787	THINK LIKE THE D CELL IT'S LIKE THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5788	WELL IF YOU PUT LIKE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT UM UH I FORGOT
Line_5789	UH A CIRCUIT CAN IF YOU ATTRACT WIRES TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB H UM LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_5790	THERE UM WIRES ARE TAKING POWER FROM THE UM D CELL PRETTY MUCH AND THEN IT'S GIVING THE POWER TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5791	I THINK IT MIGHT BE LIKE ELECTRICITY BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5792	A IT'S WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND TO THE D CELL AND YEAH
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE A ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB WHICH IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_5794	WELL ONE MAKES A TOUCH ON THE BOTTOM ONE NEGS A TOUCH ON THE SIDE ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WON'T TURN ON
Line_5795	MORE UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5796	I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5797	WE'RE WE WERE LIKE DOING THE STING WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_5798	WE'RE WE USED A WIRE A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR AND A LITTLE PLATFORM AND THEN A SWITCH
Line_5799	WELL THE D CELL CON IS LIKE THE IS THE ELECT TRICK SOURCE PRITTY MUCH
Line_5800	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE
Line_5801	IT PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY PRETY MUCH
Line_5802	WIRES CLAY THEY ELECTRICITY
Line_5803	I THINK IT'S LIKE IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY OR LIKE OR ELECTRICITY PRITTY MUCH I THINK
Line_5804	WELL IT'S SPINNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRES AND TH WIRES ARE PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE MOTOR
Line_5805	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL THE METAL'S TOUCHING THE WIRES PRETTY MUCH SO YEAH
Line_5806	THE MOTOR IS SPIN AL
Line_5807	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IS SPINNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_5808	WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO TOUCH N THE MOTOR
Line_5809	BOTTOM IT'S PRETTY IT'S A LIGHT BULB I MEAN UH D CELL BATTERY OR A BATTERY ON THE TOP IT'S A LIGHT BULB
Line_5810	WATCH I THINK I THINK THAT'S LIKE A SWITCH
Line_5811	THE ELECTRIC THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS PICKING UP UH WHOLE SETRO MAGNETS
Line_5812	LESS WRAPS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5813	IT GETS STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5814	IT GETS MORE MAGNET IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5815	IT PICKS UP MORE UM WASHERS
Line_5816	WELL UH THE STRENGTH IS GETTING WELL UM IT GETS STRONGER
Line_5817	YOU CAN WRAP A WIRE AROUND IT
Line_5818	CAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
Line_5819	UM THAT IT GETS STRONGER EVERY TIME THERE'S MORE WIRES
Line_5820	AY BE LIKE TWENTY I'M NOT TOO SURE BUT
Line_5821	WELL I WENT TO WHERE THE NINETY FIVE WOULD BE ON THE GRAPH AND THEN I WENT OVER AND IT LOOKED LIKE COULD BE ONE FIFTEEN
Line_5822	THESE ARE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS I THINK
Line_5823	WELL SINCE THE PAPER CLIPS STEEL IT'S PRETTY IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_5824	MOST OF THEM ARE MADE FROM STEEL SOME OF THEM ARE ALUMINIUM THE
Line_5825	STEEL AND ALUMINUM
Line_5826	THEIR OWN NOT STEEL OR ALUMINUM
Line_5827	AND CILLATORS ARE LIKE UM SPUNGES ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5828	COLUATORS ARE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT STEEL
Line_5829	WELL ONLY WELL STEEL UM CAN GET PICKED UP BY A MAGNET Y ALUMINIUM IT CAN'T
Line_5830	THEY'RE ALL STEEL
Line_5831	HI MARNEY MY NAME IS NIGALIINE HOW ARE YOU DOING DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DAY IS
Line_5832	WE'VE BEEN UM TESTING MAGNETS IN DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY STICK OR NOT
Line_5833	THEY UHM THROUGH ALL EITHER STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CONTAINS IRON OR IRON
Line_5834	ONE NAIL IS NOT IRON OR STEEL
Line_5835	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO UM IRON OR STEEL UM ONE OF THEM WASN'T MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT OT STICK
Line_5836	THE MAGNETIC FORCE CAN KINDLY GENERATE AROUND LIKE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO STICK TO OTHER THING
Line_5837	HEY CAN GO THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5838	ONE OF THE MAGNETS IS GENERATING A MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE TABLE SO IT'S MAKING IT STICK
Line_5839	I'M NOT SURE HOW IT DOES IT BUT MAGNETS CAN GET SOME HOW GENERIGHT MAGNETIC FORMS THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE ANOTHER MAGNET STICK
Line_5840	UM UH THE THICKNESS REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO THICK THEN MAGNETIC FORCE WON'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_5841	UM THAT ALL THE MAGNETIC DOMAINS INSIDE ARE ALL FACING THE SAME WAY AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH INTO TURNED IN PRETTY MUCH TURNED INTO A MAGNET
Line_5842	UM THEN IT IT ME IT FIELD AROUND IT AND IT MADE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5843	THE MAGNET HADN'T BEEN ROB D TO CHARGE THE NAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO DENSE TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5844	BECAUSE THE MAGNET SHARE CENTAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5845	A CIRCUIT IS WEIGHT FOR ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL AND IT MAKES SOME KIND OF CIRCLE FORM
Line_5846	UM ELECTRICITY TRAVELS A CIRCUIT IS THE WAY TO LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL
Line_5847	IT'S FORMING A CIRCLE
Line_5848	IT HAS TO GO FROM THE MINUS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT PULL BACK INTO THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5849	ONE HAS UM MORE THINGS IN IT THE OTHER ONE GUESSES A BASE LI LIKE BULB CIRCUIT
Line_5850	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS JUST BASICALLY
Line_5851	IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB DOWN AND THEN UP INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN DOWN AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5852	IT SHOWS LIKE HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_5853	LAND TWO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_5854	IT GOES AROUND INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UM OUT OF THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE BATTERY IT ITS HEEP CIRCLING
Line_5855	I'VE ALREADY SAID ENOUGH AT THAT FLOW
Line_5856	UM THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE BRING IT IN
Line_5857	NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU TURN IT THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALWAYS GOING TO PUT THE ELECTRICITY OUT IN THE PLUS IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING IT IN
Line_5858	UM THE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE STILL GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5859	THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM YOU SEE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS COMING OUT OF
Line_5860	AN FITTING INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A WIRE IS JUST GOING INTO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEN OUT AGAIN
Line_5861	TWO BATTERIES HAS MORE POWER THAN ONE SO THE LIGHT BULBS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
Line_5862	I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME SO HI
Line_5863	THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING RULE THE COP SILL THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5864	THE C CURLY IT BREAKS A MAGNETIC FORCE THE WEIGHT FROM THE WASHERS
Line_5865	IT'S MOVING THE BAG IT'S MOVING THE MAGNET'S FARTHER APART
Line_5866	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT'S GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AT THE CUP SO IT CAN STICK BUT IT'S DCRET BUT MY MAGNETIC FORCES DECREASING WHEN THE SPACERS ARE PUT BETWEEN THEM
Line_5867	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS EITHER HAVE LIKE A MAGNET A MAGNETS TOGETHER AND WASHERS
Line_5868	MAYBE I COULD SEE USED DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WERE IN A STRONG
Line_5869	WE WERE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY WE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT A A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANIMALS THAT USED ELECTRICITY TO FIND FOOD AND KEEP PRESERS AWAY
Line_5870	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH THE WIRES ARE UM BOTH PARALLEL TO A KIND OF PARALLEL TO EACH OTHERS
Line_5871	NO MATTER WHICH WAY THE BATTERY IS TURNED UM IT'LL ELECTRICITY ALWAYS GO OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ALWAYS GO IN UP TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5872	THE FLOW IS GOING UP PUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AROUND AND THEN THE FLOW WILL BE GOING DOWN
Line_5873	THE POSITIVE SIDE RESEIVES THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5874	THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUT IT OUT
Line_5875	THE MINUS SIDE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY OUT THAT IS FILLING UP INTO LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB THEN THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5876	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS TWO FOR EACH
Line_5877	EVERYWHERE ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS IT'S GREEN THOUGH ELECTRICITY FLOWS ALL THROUGH IT
Line_5878	THE CIRCLE AT THE LOOPS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LITTLE THE PLAIN UM LINES ARE
Line_5879	EVERYTHING IN IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN A CIRCUIT
Line_5880	IT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE'S TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5881	WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5882	WELL SINCE IT'S A ELECTRO MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR IT TO BEED TO PICK MAGNETIC THINGS UP
Line_5883	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AROUND OR ELSE IT WON'T REALLY WORK
Line_5884	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5885	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS COMPLETELY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_5886	IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN IT IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_5887	IT HAS TO BE IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE MAGNETS TO WORK
Line_5888	THE WASHERS WILL START STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_5889	THIS WHAT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE RIVET TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5890	IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
Line_5891	THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK AND IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_5892	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH EM PROPERLY BUT IF IT'S NOT THEN THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5893	DON'T KNOW
Line_5894	UM A TEMPORARY MAGNET DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER SO ELECTROMAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS A MAGNET
Line_5895	SO M THAT SO MAGNETS MADE ELECTRICITY TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5896	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND MAKE UM THE
Line_5897	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5898	THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TIP E THAT WORKS AS A NORMAL MAGNET THAT WILL STICK LIKE A NORMAL MAGNET
Line_5899	IT KIND OF PUTS THAT ENERGY OUT INTO THE WIRES SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE SOURCE OF IT
Line_5900	U THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE UM OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5901	HEY LET THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT SO IT CAN LIKE GO TO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT TO GO TO
Line_5902	THEY LEAVE THE UM ELECTRICICITY KIND THROW THROUGH SO THE KI LIKE THE PAT F A LITTLE PATHWAY
Line_5903	IT'S KIND OF WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT NEEDS ELECTRICITY SO
Line_5904	A RECEIVER MEANS THAT YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5905	IT USES THE ELECTRICITY TO START RAINING
Line_5906	IT'S RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S RUNNING
Line_5907	WHEN THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING METAL UM THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_5908	IT'S TOUCHING METAL AND MAKING THE MOTORS SPIN
Line_5909	IT'S TOUCHING TO IN THE METAL I
Line_5910	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5911	MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCLE
Line_5912	IT'S GOING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE MOTOR OUT OF THE MOTOR AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_5913	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EITHER LIKE TOUCHING A BATTERY OR METALS
Line_5914	THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES FLOWING TO THE LITTLE CIRCLE WITH THE THINGS IN IT
Line_5915	THE CIRCLE WITH THE LUGINET IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5916	A BATTERY ONE SIDE IS THE PLUS SUB ONE LINE IS THE PLUS SIDE THE OTHER SIDE IS THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5917	THERE IS A BATTERY A MOTOR AND TWO WIRENS
Line_5918	IT'S A MOTOR UM THE UM IT'S PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE THE MOTORS STUCK TO THEN
Line_5919	THE LITTLE LINES IS A DOT ON THE END IS A SWITCH
Line_5920	IT SHOWS YOU A WAY TO SET UP THE CIRCUITS
Line_5921	THEY'RE MAGNETS LI USE ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS MAGNETS
Line_5922	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5923	IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTROMAGNET TO WORK
Line_5924	A A CLOSED CIRCUIT THAT'S ELECTRICITY FLOW BUT AN OPEN CIRCUIT DOESN'T
Line_5925	THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT ON THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS
Line_5926	IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED LINES IT'S SUPER STRONG SO OU CAN PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIKE FIVE IT COULD ONLY PICK UP LIKE TWO OR THREE
Line_5927	IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT MAKES THE MAG THE ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
Line_5928	THE MORE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIVET THE STRONGER IT IS
Line_5929	THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UM OR STUFF
Line_5930	UM HOW MUCH CHARGE D THE BATTERY HAS AND HOW CLIFF AND THE SWITCH
Line_5931	MORE WINDS GIVES IT MORE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS SO IF IT HAS MORE WINDS IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS S
Line_5932	UHM YOU COULD WIND IT MORE
Line_5933	THE MORE WINDS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP
Line_5934	IT GETS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN GET
Line_5935	PROBABLY IN A BAR GRAPH LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TEN LINES THREE WASHERS TWENTY LINES FIVE WASHERS AND IT KEEPS FILING UP
Line_5936	THE NUMBER'S KEEP GOING UP
Line_5937	THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE STRONGER THE MAGNET GETS
Line_5938	IF IT DOESN'T PICK UP VERY MANY THEN IT WOULD THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY WRAPS BUT IF IT PICKS UP A LOT THEN IT HAS A LOT WRAPS
Line_5939	WELL MANY GOT FIFTEEN AND A HALF OF TEN IS FIVE AND TEN ONLY GOT THREE
Line_5940	THAT THING ON THE LEFT TO THE WIRES THE SWITCH MAYBE TO SEE IF IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON
Line_5941	CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEM CAUSE THEY CONDUCT IT KIND OF
Line_5942	THE CONDUCTORS WERE PRETY MUCH ALL METAL THINGS AND THEY LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEM
Line_5943	WHAT'S EVER IN THE CIRCUIT LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR WILL TURN ON
Line_5944	YOU CLOSED THE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF TOUCHING THE SWITCH TO METAL YOU PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL ON IT THING TO CLOSE I
Line_5945	IT CAN L CLOSE A CIRCUIT AND LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH
Line_5946	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEY DON'T CLOSE THE CIRCUIT SO NOTHING WILL TURN ON
Line_5947	CONDUCTORS LET THE UM CIRCUITS TURN ON BUT INSULATORS DON'T
Line_5948	THE MOTOR STAND STILL BECAUSE INSULATORS ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE OF METAL
Line_5949	INSULATORS ARE NOT REALLY MADE OF METAL STRAWS WOOD ROCKS AND LIKE S PUNCHES AN NONE OF THEM ARE MADE OF METAL
Line_5950	THEY WON'T CLOSE A CIRCUIT SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON
Line_5951	THEY'RE PR TY MUCH LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF CONDUCTORS THEY CAN'T CLOSE A CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL USUALLY
Line_5952	IRON AND STEEL WHICH ARE BOTH METAL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5953	ARE BOTH EITHER IRON OR STEEL
Line_5954	UH MY NAME IS KEHNAMOSOM
Line_5955	MAGNET IT'S A MAGNET MAGNET ATTRACTS IRON
Line_5956	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASTROM WE WERE E WE'RE DOING MAGNETISM AND OR TOCHERS SAID THAT
Line_5957	AT REPEL AND ATTRACTS
Line_5958	WELL THE END AND THE END BOUNDS OFF AND THE END AND THE ES COME TOGETHER AND THE ES AND THE END COME TOGETHER I PUT THE ES AND THE ES BOUNDS OFF
Line_5959	OH I AM DONE
Line_5960	WELL THEY HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE BRADS AND THE BRADS HAVE TO BE ATTACHED ANOTHER WIRE UNDER UNDER THE BORED
Line_5961	THEY THEY ARE CALLED BRANDS OR COMPONENTS ARMEN CONDUCTORS
Line_5962	IF IF THE BRADS WEREN'T METAL THAT MEANS ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT IT IT WOULD JUST IT WOULDN'T JUST GO THROUGH IT AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T
Line_5963	WELL THE WIRE UNDERNEATH THE BRADS UH MAKES THE I MAKES IT A WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_5964	BECAUSE THE IRON IS BECAUSE THE IRON AND THE M UM ATTRACTS TO EACH OTHER
Line_5965	IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPEL WHEN THEY ARE ACT
Line_5966	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE REALLY STRONG AND THEY CAN GO THROUGH REALLY THICK THINGS
Line_5967	WELL IF IT GOES THROUGH THINGS THAT MEANS A MAGNET REALLY STRONG
Line_5968	UM A TABLE UH UM A WASHER
Line_5969	W WELL THE THICKNESS IS LIKE
Line_5970	OUT WE'RE ALL THE MAGNETIC UM ER THE MAGNET IS MAKING UM THE NAIL
Line_5971	IT DOTS ME THAT THERE'S MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE UM NAIL SO THAT IT WILL ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5972	YOU HAVE TO UM SLIDE THE MAGNET ACROSS THE NAIL SO IT WOULD MAKE A MAGNETIC FIELD TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5973	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS ABOUT TO I DON'T MEAN NOW TO WIT NO
Line_5974	WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE IT HAS WIRES AND IT ON THE IT WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT BECAUSE U
Line_5975	ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE
Line_5976	BECAUSE ONE THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB UM AND TWO WIRES AND THE OTHER THERE IS THREE WIRES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5977	T'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5978	WELL IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND IT FLOWS OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5979	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH THE POSITIVE OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5980	WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5981	WELL IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS ONE AND UHM BE LIT AS MUCH
Line_5982	WELL IF THE IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T BE AS LIT
Line_5983	WELL THE ENERGY UM FLOWS THROUGH UM BOTH BATTERIES AND GETS MORE POWER TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB MORE
Line_5984	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIT MORE AND THE ONE HAS ONE BATTERY WOULD UM BE LIT LESS
Line_5985	UM THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES IS LIT UM MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS A LOT MORE BRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY MAKES LIGHT BULBS UM DIM
Line_5986	IF YOU DID IT ADD MORE UM ANOTHER BATTERY OR MORE POWER THE LIGHT BULB WOULD BE STILL DIM
Line_5987	UM THE ENERGY UHM S MORE IS MORE POWERED AND IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT MORE
Line_5988	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IT'S WHEN
Line_5989	WELL WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL SERIES CIRCUIT IT MAKES A LIGHT BULBS LIGHT MORE
Line_5990	WELL HERE THERE IS A TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES AND WIRES CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_5991	UM WELL STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5992	HERE IS TWO UM PATHWAYS ON THIS PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_5993	UM I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER IT
Line_5994	THE BLUE DOTS IS THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING REALLY FAST HER THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5995	GOING INTO THE BATTERY AT THE UM POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GETTING RE CHARGED AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POWERING LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
Line_5996	UM THERE IS TWO UM LIGHT BULBS BOTH POWER A LOT AND TWO FOR UM WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5997	T'S UM IT'S SHOWING TWO LIGHT BULBS FOUR WIRES AND UM A BATTERY OF A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5998	THE MIDTAL SYMBLEE UM REPRESENTS A BATTERY
Line_5999	REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6000	ALS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM THAT'S LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6001	-IRCUIT MEANS THAT THE UM WIRES ARE NEVER TOUCHING AND THEY'RE JUST GOING ON AND THEY NEVER TOUCH
Line_6002	IT TELLS ME THAT THE THAT THE BATTERY CHARGES BOTH LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6003	THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
Line_6004	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_6005	MEAN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO ELECTRICITY WILL TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_6006	UM WELL IT'S IMPORTANT A
Line_6007	ITCH IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT CAN TURN OFF THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OR ON THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_6008	LI
Line_6009	UM A
Line_6010	IT IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT UM AND I WAS PUTTING IT AGAINST THE WASHERS THE IT WASN'T PICKING IT UP AT ANY WASHERS
Line_6011	WELL THE THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET SO THAT THE RIVET CAN PICK UP THE WASHES
Line_6012	IT HAS TO BE WINED FROM LIKE STEEL OR IRON
Line_6013	WE WENT UM WE WRAPPED IT AROUND FIVE AND THEN TEN TIMES AND THEN FIFTEEN AND THEN TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY FIVE AND TEN THIRTY
Line_6014	IF YOU IT SHOWS THAT THAT IF YOU YOU WRAPPED IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MEANS IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6015	MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM THAT YOU WRAP THE WIRE UM A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET
Line_6016	WELL IT'S IT GETS MORE STRAINTH BY IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND IF YOU WRAP IF YOU RAP THE WIRES AROUND IT MORSE
Line_6017	IF IT PICKS UP OR WASHERS MEAN IT THE ELECTROMAGNET IS STRONGER
Line_6018	BY WRAPPING THE UM THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET ALIKE MORE
Line_6019	WELL THE MORE YOU WIND IT AROUND THE RIVET UM THE MORE YOU WIND THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6020	IF IF YOU KEEP UM RAPPING IT AROUND MORE AROUND THE VER- THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6021	IT'S STRONGER THAN A WASHER THAT PICKS UP WASH WASHERS
Line_6022	IT GETS STRONGER BECAUSE MORE AL ELECTRICITY IS GOING AROUND IT SO IT GETS STRONGER AND IT CAN PICK UP MORE
Line_6023	WELL IT SHOWS THAT WHEN I INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WRAPS THE MORE WASHERS IT GET SO
Line_6024	NO YEAH
Line_6025	UM WELL THE NUMBER RAFT GETS HIRE TO LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY A HUNDRED
Line_6026	NUMBER WRAPS GETS LARGER THE UM THE HIVE THE LITTLE GREEN DOTS GO AND THE HIVE THEY UM THE GREEN LINE GOES
Line_6027	THE WASHERS ARE UM GETTING SO THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE WASHERS THE MORE WRAPS
Line_6028	WELL INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT I THAT IF YOU PUT ATTACH THEM TO THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY WON'T THROUGH THROUGH HIM AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6029	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH THE UM ROCK OR THE SPONGE AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6030	IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR ATTACHED TO THE WIRE AND THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING
Line_6031	THE SH ALL IS MADE OF PLASTIC SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_6032	THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS AND THEY ALL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6033	S STEEL METAL ALUMINIUM ANYTHING THAT CAN STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_6034	W WELL METAL HAS IRON IN IT AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IRON AND CERTAIN THINGS TO STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6035	YES MARNEY YOU DID REPEAT YOURSELF AND YOU DID IT FOR A GOOD H
Line_6036	I I'VE BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME
Line_6037	S SOME OF THEM WILL STICK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM WON'T
Line_6038	VERY WELL IN HAVING SO MUCH FUN HOW C YOU
Line_6039	WELL THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BOARDS AND THEY HAVE BRADS AND THEY HAVE A WIRE THROUGH THERE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WIRE IS SO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_6040	WELL IF THERE IS NO WIRE BEHIND THE BOARD THEN THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR WOULD NEVER LIGHT UP
Line_6041	WELL THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE RUNNING FROM EACH END TO THE BRADS
Line_6042	WELL THEY'RE EASY TO PUT YOU'RE WIRES TWO AND THEIR METAL
Line_6043	WELL METAL WELL ELECTRICITY CAN RUN THROUGH METAL AND THIS CASE IT IS METAL AND SO IT JUST ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE A AND YEAH
Line_6044	WELL BEHIND EACH BRAND THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED
Line_6045	IT TELLS ME THAT BEHIND A AND B BRADS ARE CONNECTED TO A SMALL WIRE THAT COMPLETES THE CIRCUITS
Line_6046	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HANG ON
Line_6047	I THINK THEY FORCE THE MAGNET UM I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S THE FORCE JUST BECAUSE I GUESS
Line_6048	WELL I SORT OF DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS IS DOING
Line_6049	OH I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPOLARERRY MAGNET
Line_6050	HM YOU HAVE RIVEN ON TOP THE NAIL OR STICK IT ON THE END FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THE MAGNET FIELD CAN GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_6051	THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMP POLE RED MAGNET
Line_6052	OHES SO WEIGHT HANG ON
Line_6053	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND TRAIN TO LIGHT TO LIGHT BULBS YEAH
Line_6054	WELL THE ELECTRICITY GOES SORT OF ON A PATHWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BATTERY AND JUILIC BULB AND BACK OUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6055	WELL ONE OF THEM IS POWERING TWO BATTERIES I MEAN TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6056	WELL THIS SORT HAVE TO SHARE THE ELECTRICITY SO ONE THEN SO THEY BOTH GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER SO THEY CAN BOTH GET LIGHT UP
Line_6057	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_6058	HER BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6059	WELL THE BLUE DOT SORT OF SHOW A ELECTRICITY I GUESS
Line_6060	WELL OF COURSE THE ELECTRICITYACITY FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE BATTERY
Line_6061	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO BOTH BATTERY AND MEA THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
Line_6062	WELL THE IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6063	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT AND INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_6064	WELL ELECTRICITY F FLOWS FROM THE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_6065	UM THE END THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF A BATTER
Line_6066	IT REVERSES THE DIRECTION OF THE WAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6067	WELL IT WORKS BOTH WAYS IT JUST REVERSES THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRICITY FLOSS
Line_6068	WELL FLOW IT'S THE WAY IT'S LIKE A PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_6069	WELL IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP A LOT MORE
Line_6070	WELL IT DEFINIMLY DOES LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB A LOT MORE
Line_6071	THERE IS MORE ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY WHICH MEANS IT FLOWS FASTER
Line_6072	THEY LIT UP THEY THEY LIT UP A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_6073	THEY GET A LOT BOTH LIGHT BULBS GET A LOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THE ROME BATTERY SO THEY EACH PUT POWER THE SAME
Line_6074	WELL WHEN THERE TWO BATTERIES THEY WILL THEY LIGHT UP A LOT BRIGHTER AND WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THEY WON'T LIGHT UP AS MUCH
Line_6075	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING AND IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL WORK
Line_6076	MARNEY HAVE ARRADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_6077	ONE- THEY GET FASTER
Line_6078	THEY GETS UM THE ELECTRICITY GETS FASTER
Line_6079	AVERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_6080	UM THE FORCE IN GETS WEAKER
Line_6081	THE FORCE IS UM A STRONGER
Line_6082	WELL WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE PUT WASHERS INTO CUPS A
Line_6083	THERE ARE UHM WHAT'S IT CALLED THERE ARE LIKE CHIPS THE CHIPS ARE BETWEEN IT IT SO IT IT WEAKENS THE FORCE
Line_6084	UM ADDING SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNET UM WEAKENS THE FORCE YOU KNOW IF THE MAGNETS
Line_6085	THE DISTANCE GETS THEIRS FARTHER APART WHICH MEANS IT WEAKENS THEIR FORCE
Line_6086	DON'T YOU MEAN B IN D
Line_6087	B AND D GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE THEY DID THE SAME PERSCEAGERS BUT GROUPS DIDN'T
Line_6088	A WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6089	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_6090	WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T SAY THAT
Line_6091	ITS IS A ROPE VERY NEATLY
Line_6092	IT'S CALLED A STEEL RIVET SO
Line_6093	UM SO SO THE WIRE CAN FLOW THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_6094	WELL THERE ARE WASHERS DOWN THERE IN IT SORT OF AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6095	WELL YOU NEED TO THINK WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING APART IF THERE'S NOT ONE PART THEN THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK
Line_6096	WE NEED A RAPPED AROUND THE THE RIVET VERY VERY LIKE PRECISE
Line_6097	THE WASHERS COME UP AND LIKE CONNECTS TO THE RIVET
Line_6098	WELL RIGHT NOW IT'S UM LIGHT A CLOSED
Line_6099	WELL IT JUST IT WHATEVER THE ELECTRO MAGIC HAD PICKED UP IT DRIPS
Line_6100	HER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THE WASHERS GO UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6101	THEN THE WASHERS GO BACK UP ONTO THE RIVETS
Line_6102	WELL WITHOUT THE ELECTRICITY THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD JUST BE A PLAIN RIVET BUT YOU NEED THE ELECTRICITY TO GO IN THE RIVET AND PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_6103	M BECAUSE UM
Line_6104	UM THE RIVET OR CORE HAS BEEN MADE FROM IRON TO BE IN TEMPORARY MAGNETS
Line_6105	WELL THAT YOU IT JUST NEEDS TO BE REPTURE AND SOMETHING MADE IRON TO BE A TEMPORY MAGNET F APPER AND SOMETHING LIKE AS MADE A PLASTIC THAT THING WILL HAPPEN
Line_6106	VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6107	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_6108	YOU NEED A SWITCH A MOTOR A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_6109	THE BATTERY IS THE SOURCE AND THE SOURCE GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO TO JUST SEND THE ELECTRICITY DOWN TO WHATEVER IT'S POSED TO DO
Line_6110	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE PUT FROM THE NEGATIVE END OF THE D CELL BACK TO THE POSITIVE
Line_6111	WELL A MOTOR IS WHAT I A MOTOR COULD BE THE RECEIVER IT COULD BE UM THE MOTOR CAN BE A RECEIVER IT IS THE RECEIVER
Line_6112	A RECEIVERS A RECEIVER IS THE THING THAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6113	MARNEY I DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6114	THE MOTOR IS UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_6115	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVERY WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED
Line_6116	THE SIMBLES UM THE LINE WITH THE LONGER LINE THE SHORT LINE AND THE LONG LINE SET THE BATTERY AND THE CIRCLE WITH A LITTLE LOOP IN THE MIDDLE IS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6117	THE M IS FOR THE MOTOR
Line_6118	WE MAKE IN UM UM N UH A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6119	IT'S NOT A WASHER CONDUCTOR TOO
Line_6120	INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND THEY BLOCKS ELECTRICITY FROM COMING THROUGH
Line_6121	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THRI'LL FLOW THROUGH THEM AND CONDUCTORS DO
Line_6122	WELL ONLY METAL ONES WORK UH ONLY
Line_6123	UM I WAS TALKING
Line_6124	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR I MEAN OPEN WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR
Line_6125	IT'S CLOSED
Line_6126	WELL YOU CAN MAKE METAL INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6127	IT'S IT UM IT HAS TO BE UM LIKE STEEL
Line_6128	THEY ALL HAVE TO BE STEEL METAL
Line_6129	I I HAVE IT TO WORK
Line_6130	Y YES I DO GET THAT MARNEY
Line_6131	YES I AM READY
Line_6132	WELL WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE SUN AND STUFF LIKE A
Line_6133	UH WE HAVE OBSERVED HOW IT CONNECTS TO THINGS AND HOW IT CAN STICK TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC
Line_6134	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_6135	THEY CONNECTS THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND THAT HAVE IRON IN THEM MOST OF THE TIME
Line_6136	AND THAT'S WHY UM I THEN CONNECT
Line_6137	PUT THEN THE BOTTOM ONES WEREN'T CONNECTING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALUMINIUM IN THEM
Line_6138	THEY ARE CLICKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_6139	PUSHED AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALUMINIUM AND NOT IRON LIKE THE OTHERS ONES
Line_6140	THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON AND PUT THE THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE DON'T HAVE ANY THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ALUMINUM
Line_6141	BY NICE MEETING YOU BY
Line_6142	O DON'T WANT TO GET BRMMED
Line_6143	RE MADE OUT OF METALS
Line_6144	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_6145	WHAT HAVE HAS TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE TO GET A SWITCH
Line_6146	IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IF IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IT MAKES ELECTRICITY AND YES
Line_6147	DUH WE NEED TO GO BYE
Line_6148	HALLOW
Line_6149	N JUST CLIT ON JUST ONE MINUTE
Line_6150	BUT WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE MAGNET WE WILL HAVE A S EVERYTHING WILL FALL AND THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WON'T BE CONNECTED TO THE NAIL BUT THE NAIL LED WILL BE CONNECTED
Line_6151	WHEN THE MAGNET IS IS ON THE NAIL IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE MAGNET IT LEFT GOES
Line_6152	THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A TEMPORVERY MAGNET
Line_6153	HM THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS
Line_6154	WAIT SO WE
Line_6155	WE'VE BEEN DOING PATHWAYS AND ELECTRICITY AND STUFF
Line_6156	UM IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT FLOWS THE PUATIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6157	A CIRCUIT IS WHERE IT GOES ALWAYS THROUGH AND HAS A BUR IN IT AND IT
Line_6158	AM THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6159	IT CIRCLES AROUND THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WITH THE S
Line_6160	THE BATTERY HAS TO BE POSITIVE TO MAGNET
Line_6161	ON THE FIRST PICTURE WHEN ON THE SECOND PICTURE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6162	THEY CAN PARTS BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP
Line_6163	UM ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WHICH BUT THEN THEY'RE THEY'RE POINTING THE SAME WAY SO THAT'S CAUSING IT TO NOT
Line_6164	IT'S DIPPING DOWN BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A FULL FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6165	IT DIDN'T IT DOES COMPARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE ONE'S DEN AND ONE'S FULLY LITTLE
Line_6166	WELL THE BLUE DOTS KEEP GOING AND GOING UNTIL THEY STOP WHEN YOU JUST CONNECT THE WIRE'S
Line_6167	WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BOLT
Line_6168	THAT IF TOO GET UH
Line_6169	UM IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SO THAT IT SHOWS ME THAT THERE THERE IS A FLOW BUT IF THERE IS NOT A FLOW THEN THE LIGHT BUBBLES NOT LIGHT UP
Line_6170	WHEN YOU SWITCH IT IT GOES ONE DIRECTION BUT THAN WHEN YOU SWITCH IT LIKE THAT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_6171	IT ALWAYS FLOWS UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6172	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE POSITIVE
Line_6173	IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH LIGHT
Line_6174	IT WORKS LIKE IT DID BEFORE BUT JUST A LITTLE MORE POWDER
Line_6175	I NOTICED THAT THEY WERE BOTH FLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_6176	THAT ACTUALLY ONE D CELLS CAN BE
Line_6177	THEY'RE LINED UP THE SAME BUT THERE IS A FLUE BUT THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST FLOWING THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION S
Line_6178	WELL IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6179	IT MAKES IT HAVE MORE POWER AND LIGHTS UP MORE
Line_6180	UM IT LIGHTS UP MORE BECAUSE OF THE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY
Line_6181	IT'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6182	US ELECTRICITY MOSTLY
Line_6183	I FLICK IT OUT THAT'S UM
Line_6184	A IT REPRESENTS TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCH
Line_6185	TALKS ON METAL
Line_6186	WE'VE BEEN DEVELING WITH MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM
Line_6187	TH THERE IS NINETEEN WASHERS
Line_6188	THEY'RE WEIGHT WHAT IS
Line_6189	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE MAGNETS HAVE ENOUGH FORCE TO GET THROUGH ONE SPACER SO IT DOESN'T MOVES CUP B AND IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP A
Line_6190	THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACERS THAT IT TOOK THAT THE FORCE COULDN- STAY TOGETHER AND THEY WOULDN'T STICK SO
Line_6191	FIVE SPACERS NEEDED THREE THREE WASHERS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS ENOUGH
Line_6192	EY ARE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_6193	EDGES FOLLOW THE RULES AND LOOK OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN'T DO
Line_6194	B IN D UH NINETEEN WASHERS AND THAT WAS ENOUGH IN THE OTHER PICTURES THAT YOU SHOWED ME TO DISCONNECT IT AND THEN IN HAVE ENOUGH FORSE
Line_6195	TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS AND A NINETEEN WASHERS AND B LI TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS AND THEN IN GROUP A SAME FIVE
Line_6196	SPACERS AND THEN I THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
Line_6197	A NINE TEEN B NINE TEEN C FIVE D NINETEEN
Line_6198	IT'S ABOUT W WHAT THE RIVET CAN PICK UP
Line_6199	UM YOU MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE OF THE THE RIVET CAN HA HAS MOST OF THE ENERGY
Line_6200	IT MEANS THAT THERE IS MAGNETISM IN IT AND THAT THERE'S A A LOT OF STUFF IN IT
Line_6201	PROBABLY A WASHER MAKES IT WORK BUT IT SOMETIMES WON'T
Line_6202	I'M SORRY WAIT
Line_6203	UM WELL IT'S JUST KIND OF NEXT BECAUSE OF THE FLOW THAT PROBABLY
Line_6204	THE FLOW IS THE BATH FULLY WATERS IS DOING IF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OR IF IT IS NOT
Line_6205	THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S CLOSED THERE IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY SO FLOWING
Line_6206	LAND HAS TO BE UM CLOSED FOR IT TO ATTRACT IT
Line_6207	IT HAS TO BE MANY FROM
Line_6208	UM IT RAINS OR BATTERY POWER WHEN THEY'RE USED TOO MUCH AND IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP LITTLE UH BUT YET IT MANE THE THING YOU JUST MENTIONED TO ME
Line_6209	IT'S A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB STAND WIRES AND A LITTLE STANDS FOR EVERYTHING TO GO INTO
Line_6210	YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER AND THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN AH MIKE DASH IN THE BATTERY DE D SE
Line_6211	WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IT RECEIVES THE BATTERY IN THE POWER AND THE ELECTRICITY T
Line_6212	WHAT I CAN DO IS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT GOES POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE
Line_6213	THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE INTO THE BOTTOM INTO THE SIDES
Line_6214	BUT AFTER THAT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING IT WILL JUST STAY THERE YEAH
Line_6215	UM ELECTRICITY AND IT FLOWS YEAH AND JUST FLOWS IN STUFF I
Line_6216	UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6217	UHM THE BATTERY HELPS THAT AND IT MADE IT WORK
Line_6218	IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IT CAN FLOW TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAYS THAT IT FLOWS AND SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_6219	UM IT LIGHTS THE LIGHT BULBS UP
Line_6220	M ONE GOES TO THE SIDE AND ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6221	AND THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE
Line_6222	MOST BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING FLOWING A IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_6223	SO THE POSITIVE GOES TO THE NEGAT
Line_6224	THE BULB IS CLOSED IT'S NOT OPEN
Line_6225	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT STUFF TO MAKE LIKE A SWITCH WORK AND MAKE THE LIGHTS LIGHT UP
Line_6226	SO THE SWITCH IS WHAT CONTAINS THE UM I
Line_6227	UM G LIKE HOPES THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6228	UH UM THE D CELL BATTERY UM CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_6229	THE D CELL MAKES IT LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE WIRES AND THE THE MOTOR
Line_6230	T ELECTRICITY
Line_6231	UM IT HELPS THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6232	IT CARRIES ELECTRICITY POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6233	ITS CONNECTS AND THAT MAKES IT BOTH LIGHT UP AND THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6234	I SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_6235	IT RECEIVES IT AND THEN SHIPS IT OFF TO NEW ORLENDS SORRY Y
Line_6236	UM IT MAKES IT WORK WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT IT SHUTS EVERYTHING OFF WELL
Line_6237	LE OH
Line_6238	IT'S MAKING EVERY THING GO CRAZY
Line_6239	UM WHAT IT'S HAPPENING WAS IT'S CLOSED SO THAT IT'S MAKING THE FLAG GO THROUGH
Line_6240	IT'S LOWERING A FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING FLOWING THROUGH ALL THEM
Line_6241	WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE TO MAKE IT MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6242	IT'S LETTING THE WIRES TOUCH THE MOTOR AND HELPING IT GO ON AND ONE
Line_6243	THE LIGHT BULB W
Line_6244	IT'S PROBABLY WIND DIDN'T WORK
Line_6245	WELL SEE WELL IT'S JUST A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH
Line_6246	UM THE LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTING TO THE WIRE OILEWISE UM AND THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR LETTING IT GO THROUGH
Line_6247	A BATTERY A BATTERY THAT HAS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_6248	IT'S THE MOTOR
Line_6249	H THOSE ARE THE WIRES CONNECTING
Line_6250	BATTERY A MOTOR AND UM WOULDN'T THIS S
Line_6251	UH WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_6252	THEY'RE VERY VERY STRONG
Line_6253	THERE'S A RIVET IN WASHERS AND THE RIVET'S PICKING UP THE WASHER'S
Line_6254	A IRON
Line_6255	W WASHER IS IN THE RIVET
Line_6256	IT A CLOSED
Line_6257	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STRONG SO E IT WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6258	THAT THERE'S A WATER WINDS
Line_6259	FORTY THREE CILAMIE'S THERE IS FORTY THREE WASHERS THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH
Line_6260	UM THE MORE WIRES YOU PUT IN PROBABLY
Line_6261	THE BATTERY PROBABLY LIKES THE POWER
Line_6262	IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS
Line_6263	UM YOU WA IF YOU WRAPPED
Line_6264	YOUR BATTERY PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD NEED MORE OF THE POWDER BUT THEN
Line_6265	IT IT LETS IT DOESN'T BRING UP A WO BUT IT USUALLY DOES BEGABH
Line_6266	THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT WATER POWDER
Line_6267	THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TH
Line_6268	THE GRASS UNDEGRAH WOOD BE GOOD PROBABLY
Line_6269	ON THE SIDE OF THE DRAFT IT REPRESENTS HOW MANY WASHERS WERE PICKED UP
Line_6270	MORE WASHERS TO PICKS UP
Line_6271	IT INCREASES BY TWO AND TEN UP TO ONE
Line_6272	IT GOES TO FIFTEEN STILL BUT IT'S GOING SATHTERN
Line_6273	AND I I LIKE UM WHAT THEY DO HERE THEY MICK IT UP TO GO THE FI ROW
Line_6274	THERE WAS A A LOT OF STRENGTH
Line_6275	THIRTY THIRTY PROBABLY
Line_6276	PROBABLY TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE
Line_6277	WE'VE BEEN DOING MAGNETISM AND SEEING UH WHAT COULD MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_6278	UM IF WE TAKE IN AN ALUMINUM NAIL IT ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE MOTOR WORK IF YOU CONNECT THE TWO WIRES TO IT
Line_6279	A A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET A MOTOR WORK
Line_6280	UM IT'S THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS MAKING IT WORK THE MOTOR IS LIGHT
Line_6281	TALKED TO ME WE H
Line_6282	INSULATORS ARE STUFF THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM AND THAT DON'T WORK
Line_6283	IT DON'T INSULATORS DON'T HAVE ANY THEY WON'T LET THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM I
Line_6284	WHEN I CLICKED THE SPONGE THE MOTOR DIDN'T WORK IT JUST SALT THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE
Line_6285	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK THE INSULATOR SHUT DOWN
Line_6286	METAL UM METALS CAN STICK TO IT
Line_6287	AND THE ALUMINIUM ONE DOESN'T HAVE ANY METAL IRON
Line_6288	A STEEL ON THE OUT WALL AND IT HAS IRON IN IT AND ME
Line_6289	MASWEIGHT
Line_6290	IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6291	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY I'M S
Line_6292	THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CAPACITY
Line_6293	UM YOU CAN THROUGH IT TO THE BURN MOH
Line_6294	YOU ACTS TO FILL IT TO THE BRIM
Line_6295	YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND POOR A WATER TO WATER IN S S UNTIL YOU GET
Line_6296	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT IT DON'T
Line_6297	OU COULD TAKE A SERRENZION TO IT I YES
Line_6298	MASS ACTUALLY VOLUME HUH
Line_6299	IT I CAN UM AND SO S YOU WEIGH
Line_6300	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS INSTEAD IT HOLD THREE HUNDRED
Line_6301	IT'S AS MUCH AS THE CAN CAN POSSIBILLY WENT IN
Line_6302	THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6303	IT'S WRIPPLING AS MUCH AS IT COULD
Line_6304	ER IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6305	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLA LITERS
Line_6306	THI CAN REALLY ANSWER THAT OF MY WEBLENOWLEDGE NOT THING LEN UM DONE
Line_6307	VOLUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PICTURES
Line_6308	CAPACITY IS HIGER THAN THE VOLUME
Line_6309	M IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE THE RING HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_6310	MEASURED MASS THE CAPACITY OF TENTHS AND THE VOLUME
Line_6311	THERE WAS ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_6312	THE TWOS OR THE ON INSIDE
Line_6313	EVERY TEN MILLILITERS
Line_6314	YOU COULD USE ER INCHES AND MEASURE THAT IT'S PROBABLY THE AS
Line_6315	YOU COULD AS THE SYRINGE AND SUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD PULL IT OUT
Line_6316	IT FLOCKS UP WATER AND THEN S OUT WHEN YOU PUT SIX PUSH
Line_6317	IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY MIL
Line_6318	YOU COULD SCORE THEM INTO A BETTER BIGGER NOT A BETTER
Line_6319	COULD FOLLOW IT ON A BAKER
Line_6320	IT UH BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE SYRINGE WILL'T EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE
Line_6321	YOU COULD FIGURE OUT H I FORGET WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
Line_6322	OH YOU'RE WELCOME GOOD BYE
Line_6323	WELL WE HAD D
Line_6324	CAPACITY IS THE MEASUREMENT HOW UMSOMELY C CAPACITY
Line_6325	HOW MUCH WATER SOMETHING IS AND THIS PECKTRY HAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLIMETERS IT'S JUST IN FAST TRADITION
Line_6326	M MMM I'M NOT SURE
Line_6327	HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN THE CUP
Line_6328	WE TOOK SODA CANS TO SEE IF THE SODA CAN TO THE TRICK ABOUT OR DIDN'T NOT TELL THE TRIBE ABOUT IT
Line_6329	AND WE DIDN'T FILL OUR S CANS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP BECAUSE UM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS FILLED ON THE TO THE TOP SO YOU SHAKE THAT BECAUSE YOU SHAKE THE SODA BEFORE YOU HELPIN IT
Line_6330	WE USED WE LEFT A LITTLE SPACE INSIDE AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER I RARED OUT HOW MUCH WATER THAT WAS
Line_6331	MEANS THAT THERE IS THREE HUNDRED OF THE MELLILITORS
Line_6332	IT COULD IT WILL ACTUALLY HURT HOLE MESS BECAUSE IT
Line_6333	I'M NOT S
Line_6334	WELL THE CAPACITY E HAS
Line_6335	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS
Line_6336	THE RANGE IS ON THE FAR LEFT AND THE METAL THERE IS A GRADUATED SILENDER AND ON THE SIDE IS ONE LITER
Line_6337	MEASURE THINGS OR WATER ROCKING
Line_6338	UM WHAT WE DO FROM MEASURING OUR FIX IT WE YEOSEPITCH TOWEL
Line_6339	YOU JUST RELATE HOW MUCH
Line_6340	HOW MUCH WATER THERE WERE AS IN ALL THE SYRINGES I PUT TOGETHER
Line_6341	THE UNITS WE USED ARE MELLOWLITE MELLOWLITERS AND LITERS
Line_6342	YOU WOULD MEASURE HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS
Line_6343	NEED OTHER TO MEASURE CAPACITY ORANGES AND ALWAYS THE BEST TOOL AT COULD SUCK UP THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_6344	YOU LOOKED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TURTLE
Line_6345	Y YOU COULD SENSE THAT IT WAS COLD
Line_6346	UM A THERMOMETER BECAUSE THERMOMETER IS CONDOLUTIVE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_6347	IT MEASURES SOMETHING AND THE THING THAT A THERMOMETER MEASURES IS TEMPERATURE SELLS YES DEGREES OR A FAIR IN HEIGHT DEGREES
Line_6348	THE THIRD AND FIT CUPS ARE HOTTER THAN THE SECOND AND THE FIRST CUP
Line_6349	GETS S WARMER
Line_6350	W WE TOOK THE ICE WATER AND
Line_6351	IT'S FIFTY DEGREES SOUTH SO IT'S WARMER THAN THE WATER ON THE LEFT WHICH IS TEN DEGREES SALT S
Line_6352	TELLS YOU UM THAT THE WATER IS WARMER THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LITTLE WATER
Line_6353	THE WATER THAT'S MARTENDGRES SALT YES TENDRA SALTS YES
Line_6354	IT'S NEXED BY MARNEY
Line_6355	UN THE COLUMN AND IN SELTH SEE A SCREEN
Line_6356	WELL I DISCOVER IT THAT IT GOT COLDER AND UH
Line_6357	THEY HAVE BEEN THAT THE IN THE FIRST THE
Line_6358	ARE THE LOUD AND THEY GOT ALLY COLD AND WE COULD WE'RE IN TO HAD TO PUT A HAND IN WHICH WAS SAT BECAUSE WE WERE HOT
Line_6359	UH IT GETS IT STAYS THE SAME AND THEN GET WORKED AT OR U
Line_6360	LO IT STARTED REALLY HIGH AND THEN IT GOT COLDER AND COLDER
Line_6361	THE LITTLE RED LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD GOES DOWN T
Line_6362	DON'T UM IT STARTED HI
Line_6363	WELL IT'S GETTING COLDER AND COVER BULDER
Line_6364	IT TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND IT'S TO BURN
Line_6365	I DUSPLAD IT WA ON THE LINES
Line_6366	I DREW UP WITH LITTLE DOTS ON A LYING GRAM
Line_6367	L THIS THAT PUT IT SO
Line_6368	WE- IT HELPS YOU
Line_6369	ERS AND THAT'S HOT MAN AND YEA
Line_6370	I PUT THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MINUTES OF HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN
Line_6371	THE DOTS ARE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND THEN THE DOTS SHOWS IT MOVING DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND WHATEVER
Line_6372	PLENTY DEGREES S
Line_6373	HE IS SEEING HOW MANY MINUTES ARE BEING BETWEEN TWENTY AND THE OR OUT
Line_6374	UM I'M NOT S
Line_6375	STARTING UP FIRST NUMBER AND S END AND AT THE LAST NUMBER
Line_6376	HE STARTED A AND THAT TWENTY IT'S FIFTEEN
Line_6377	UHM IF A TIRE OR
Line_6378	THE FIRST TWO ARE BELOW FIFTY AND THE SECOND TWO ARE OVER F
Line_6379	THAT'S THE FIRST E ARE LOWER THAN FIFTY AND THE SECOND ARE
Line_6380	I MINNANSWRIES A
Line_6381	WHAT WE A MATCH SIMPLY IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MONKEY
Line_6382	TO MEASURE THINGS AND UH S SOME KIND OF STICK THAT LITTLE LONGER THEN YOU IT STICKS
Line_6383	YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS AND IT'S MAINLY ABOUT HOW LONG IT IS
Line_6384	SO WE PUT ONE STRAW IN FRONT OF ANOTHER STRAW ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS TABLE TO FIGUER OUT HOW LONG THE TABLE WAS
Line_6385	WE WORKED ON USING THI S STRAWS
Line_6386	Y THINK THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZE S SOMETIMES
Line_6387	WE HAD DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRAWS TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENT IT COULD LOOK LIKE IT THINK
Line_6388	IT WAS SEVEN STRAWS FOR A GROUPS
Line_6389	THEY'RE THE SAME FOR THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS Y
Line_6390	YOU NEED TO USE THE SAME SIZE
Line_6391	IT MEANS KILOMETERS
Line_6392	AND ALMOST EVERYBODY AN THE ENTIRE WORLD
Line_6393	SO WE ASKED MADE IT AND WE MEAT AND THE PINKIES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT
Line_6394	YES THEM TOO I'M NOT SURE
Line_6395	BECAUSE THAT SHOWS US A BECAUSE THEY SHARE YOU NUMBERS AND IT SEE SO YOU KNOW
Line_6396	IT WAS THE WESTERN SIDE BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU MEASURE
Line_6397	THEY'RE ALL SCIENTIHPHIC MEASUREMENT USES
Line_6398	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT SIZES HAVE THINGS AND IT'S A SCIENTIFIC WEIGHT AND LENGTH AND WA HOUSE
Line_6399	THERE IS ONE TENCH IN THE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
Line_6400	YOU ARE PINKIE IRON HAND IN YOUR FOOT
Line_6401	THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
Line_6402	WELL IT SEEMS KIND THAT'S LIKE YOU UM A
Line_6403	MEASURING IT LIKE YOUR PINKIE OR WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET OR PART OF YOUR BODY BY MEASURING IT THAT WAY
Line_6404	WELL IF THE HAND IT'S FIVE INCHES ON I MEAN TEN INCHES LONG SO THEN THE SIDE WILL BE ABOUT T
Line_6405	WELL THE LIGHT BORBS ESTIMATE WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR RULERS ALONG WHICH WOULD BE
Line_6406	WELL IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING A TON OF TIMES YOU'RE PROBABLY WHEN TH TIME IS GOING TO GET THE RIGHT ESTIMATE SO IT HELPS YOU
Line_6407	GETTING BETTER AT ESTIMATING BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU GET BETTER AND GET THE CLOSER AND
Line_6408	HAH YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6409	AT A HORSE FRENCH YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE CARRYING MEASURING PAPER OUT BUT IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG YOUR HORSE WAS YOU'D PROBABLY NEED TEST MAKE
Line_6410	USE A MEASURING TAPE OR USE YOUR OR IRON
Line_6411	IT HELPS YOU TIGER OUT HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6412	BECAUSE METER TAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND HANDS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES E
Line_6413	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_6414	IT SHOWS YOU THAT IF YOU BEGIN AT ONE DAY END AN END AT THE R
Line_6415	GETTING A END OF THE PAPER
Line_6416	IT FELT KIND OF HARD BECAUSE NOBODY HAD THE EXACT RIGHT WEIGH TO MEASURE FROM TIES HEIGHT
Line_6417	WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIGURED OUT THE CLOSEST GUESS WE COULD GET TO WITH OUR FRIENDS
Line_6418	WE NEEDED TO LIKE THE CRACT TECNIEETE TO MAKE IT THE TEACHER RECOMMENDED
Line_6419	S IMPORTANT AND BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN IF THE ANSWER THE SAME ANSWER DIE THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT CRECT ANSWER
Line_6420	ROWS A LITTLE HARD BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU FELT IT WOULD BE THE SAME RESULT THAT IT CAME IT LOG DIFFERENTLY
Line_6421	METER TAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY BREAK THE METERS STICK IT AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO ME
Line_6422	LIKE THE OBJECTS WAS BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING OR
Line_6423	THE FINGER WAS THE SAME SIZE AS ONE KILOMETER
Line_6424	IT GIVES US IRECTURENTS TO D STUFF BECAUSE WE YOU'RE FIRST SLOWS OF IMPORT AND THEN A HELPFUL
Line_6425	E WON'T REALLY ANY BODY PUT MEASUREMENTS THAT WE'RE THE SAME BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH MEASURING BEFORE WE LEFT RES
Line_6426	THE FRUIT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FLOOR ARE
Line_6427	O HURT THE SAME BUT OTHERS AREN'T NO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BODY PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME AS EVERYBODY PARTS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IT
Line_6428	YOU PROBABLY IS THE REFERENCE THE PINKIE HAS TWO INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_6429	YOU USE THE SMALLEST AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT CALLED
Line_6430	GAIN I THINK IT KIND THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING I'M NOT YEAR
Line_6431	HE WOULD LOSE THEM WHEN THE THING A METAL STUCK UH WHEN YOU KNEW HER TO MEASURE SOMETHING
Line_6432	WE'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MASS TODAY AND MISS IS SHINES CLASS
Line_6433	YOU MEASURED THE MASS AND ESTIMATE IT THEN WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND WITH A STAIL TWICE
Line_6434	IT'S A STEEL TO FINGER UP THE WEIGHT
Line_6435	UH IT MAKES IT'S A
Line_6436	WELL YOU COULD USE DIFFERENT REFERENCES TO MEASURE THE M
Line_6437	IT'S A PAPER CLIP
Line_6438	GROUP TWO HAS A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND GROUP ONE HAS A A SMALLER PAPER CLIP
Line_6439	YOU COULD HAVE THEM WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH- YOU COULD HAVE THEM IS THE SAME SIZE INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6440	GROUP TWO HAS SMALLER BUT GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER RESULTS
Line_6441	THAT'S ONE GRAM WE LOVE THOSE FOR TRYING HOW MUCH STUFF WEIGHED
Line_6442	WE MEASURED THE THINGS WE USED IT SCIENCE
Line_6443	TE YOU A MORE EXACT ANSWER
Line_6444	I KNOW THAT A IT WEIGHS MORE THAN A SMALL ONE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND MASS
Line_6445	THE A LARGE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_6446	WELL THERE IS THE METAL DISK IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY GRANDS THERE ARE IN THE
Line_6447	IT'S IN A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINES
Line_6448	WELL I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT I
Line_6449	AN BECAUSE WE'RE MASTERING WITH GRAMS Y
Line_6450	ONE GRAM FIVE ONE GRAM FIVE IT MATH TELLS YOU
Line_6451	THEY'RE BEING USED TO MEASURE THE MASS OF THE PIECES OF WOOD
Line_6452	CAN THEY ALL RIGHT THE PENCIL IS TWO NICLAS THAT MUST MEAN IT TEN GRAMS
Line_6453	A METAL DISC S A GRAM
Line_6454	THE TOY CAR WEIGHS SEVEN S GRAMS
Line_6455	TWENTY BLUE WE
Line_6456	IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU IT'S YOU'RE GOING A NEEDLE ON WATER I
Line_6457	THE ORANGE WEIGHS MORE THAN ALL THE GRAM PIECES AND THE BUT
Line_6458	WELL OUR TEATURE HAD US TAKE IN SCIENCE TO THEY SHE HAD US TAKE
Line_6459	THE ORANGE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_6460	IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND THE OTHER SIDE IT'S ON A HUNDRED GRAMS TWO
Line_6461	A KELOGRAM IS TEN OF ONE HUNDRED GRAMS Y
Line_6462	YOU YOU NEED TO USE A SNAIL
Line_6463	TWO THREE AND EIGHTY
Line_6464	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORK TODAY WE WORKED WITH A SPUNGE AND WATER
Line_6465	SPUNGE ON THE LEFT IS DRY THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE UH SAT AND THE SPONGE ON THE RIGHT SOAKED AND THEY GROW AS THEY GOT WET AND THROUGH DRY
Line_6466	WELL IT'S A SPONGE THAT ITS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET
Line_6467	IT'S A WET SPONGE WHICH MEANS IT HASN'T GROWN ALL THE WAY TO SOAK A SOAKED SPONGE BUT IT IS STILL GETTING BIG TO STEEL BIGGER THIN
Line_6468	IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOTALLY WET AND IT'S YOU IT'S DRIPPING REALLY WET
Line_6469	WHEN IT'S ALL THE WAY WHEN IT'S LARGEST IT CAN GET
Line_6470	YOU CAN TAKE THE WET SPONGE YOU CAN USE A SPONGE AND USED GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6471	THERE IS NO GRAMS IN THE CANIONID TO PUT GRAMS IN THE CUP UM
Line_6472	YOU USED GRAMS TO WEIGH IT T
Line_6473	SPUNCH IS F OR THREE GRAMS LONG
Line_6474	SPONGE WEIGHS THREE GRAMS TIL YOU DOE
Line_6475	IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_6476	IT'S SIXTEEN GRAMS LONG IT'S SIXTEEN GRAMS AND I WEIGHT
Line_6477	Y YOU CAN UM IT YOU CAN MEASURE THE DIFFERENT
Line_6478	SO YOU MEASURED THEM BOTH TO AND THE ANSWERS CERCHING GRAMS WATER BECAUSE YOU TOOK THREE AWAY
Line_6479	IT CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_6480	YOU ARE TRYING TO FINGER OUT THE DIFFERENT S
Line_6481	IT WOULD PROBABLY T ONE PART AT A TIME
Line_6482	WELL IT SORT OF TELLS ME THAT I CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS
Line_6483	T MAINLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT AND THE CUP
Line_6484	YOU GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME ARE BECAUSE THE GROUP ONE IS BIGGER AND A GROUP TWO IS SMALL
Line_6485	IT'S A PICTURE AVAILATOR
Line_6486	WELL WE CAN MEASURE DIFFERENT WATERS A MASS OF WATERS U
Line_6487	OR MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER IS ON THE CUP
Line_6488	S SO THAT WE CAN UM
Line_6489	THE LITTLE SPIN IS ONE NAIL METER S THE THING IS ONE HUNDRED MELYMETERS
Line_6490	ONE A HUNDRED
Line_6491	I'VE USED THEM AND COOK HANG
Line_6492	IT'S FOR VALUES WHICH IS A TY GROUP ONES FOR WHICH IS A TY MILLIMETERS AND D
Line_6493	STU THE STUFF THAT WE NEED TO MANAGE IT OR
Line_6494	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6495	UM MILLIMETERS
Line_6496	IT'S PUSHING THE WATER AND SIDES THRIELWL OUT THE FRONT
Line_6497	YOU WOULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND MORE HOW MANY S
Line_6498	THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT NUMBERS F ER MILLA METERS
Line_6499	SHARED WATER
Line_6500	THAT WAS ABOUT UM OKAY THICK
Line_6501	TER A B SEE AND THROUGH THAT A THIRTY
Line_6502	WELL IT'S SALT OF
Line_6503	A SPRING CURTAIN OR WHATEVER LITTLE SQUARETY THINGS CUP
Line_6504	THEY TELL YOU SO THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS AND DO YOU CALL THIS COMPATION
Line_6505	ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AT NINE TEN SO EACH ONE AND WA
Line_6506	EACH LINE REPRESENTED TOY IT DIDN'T HAVE THE DARKER LINES THAT THEY
Line_6507	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6508	FIFTIES THE MAXIMUM THAT'S HALF OF ONE HUNDRED
Line_6509	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6510	ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GALLONS
Line_6511	ELL ON THE BACK AND SEE WHAT THE VOLUME SAYS
Line_6512	HOW MUCH THERE WAS FROM THE BOTTOM LIME BEAM
Line_6513	EACH ONE IS FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_6514	THE VOLUME THE LET AND THE CUP
Line_6515	YOU SHOULD MEASURE THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_6516	TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER ARE FILLED WITH VESSELS
Line_6517	THEIR CONTAINER IS
Line_6518	A HUNDRED MALL LITERS
Line_6519	THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIZES BUT THEY'RE THE SAME OTHERS WIRES
Line_6520	IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER TO LIT DO IT
Line_6521	THAT THE SHAPE AND THE VOLUME AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME THE VOLUME AND TAPE DON'T MATTER BUT THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER DUST
Line_6522	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_6523	WITH THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THEIR THE SURFACE ON BLOCKING IT THEY STILL CAN STICK
Line_6524	I CAN RELAX THE LINES
Line_6525	WELL ON THE THICKER PAPER IT WON'T STICK CAUSE IT'S TOO THICK BUT ON THE F PAPER IT'S THIN SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_6526	I DON'T KNOW Y
Line_6527	WITH THE ONE OF YOUR OBJECT IS A NAIL AND SO UM WHEN THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6528	I'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6529	WE WERE UM WE WERE DOING A MEASURING AND YEAH THAT STUFF
Line_6530	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6531	YES UHM MAINLY IT WAS THE WASHER
Line_6532	WHAT HOW TIGHT THE MOLECULES ARE MOLECULES ARE SOR
Line_6533	NO WE USED A SCAL
Line_6534	COUNTERWEIGHTES OR THINGS THAT MAKE OTHER THINGS ON A SCAIL EVEN LIKE STRIP LIKE STRAT SIDE TO SIDE E
Line_6535	DON'T KNOW YOUR WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6536	BECAUSE METAL WEIGHS MORE THAN PLASTIC
Line_6537	IT WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_6538	BALANCE BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOUR NOT RIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_6539	YES IF IT'S ON SCALE
Line_6540	A PLASTIC CHIP AND PAPER CLIPS ARE ON A SCAILE AND CUPS AND THEY'RE EQUAL
Line_6541	WE'VE BEEN DOING THE FISURON AND WEIGHING
Line_6542	THE PLASTIC CHIP IS THEN THE WOODEN CUBE THEN THE METAL RING
Line_6543	OUR TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
Line_6544	THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_6545	I THAT'S ALL I THINK
Line_6546	UM YOU COULD UM GET IT UM OR R AND UM YOU ESTIMATE
Line_6547	TWENTY AND THAT'S US I THINK THAT'S IT
Line_6548	UM IT'S UH HOW MUCH THEY ARE IN CELCIUS
Line_6549	UM BECAUSE WHEN IF YOU DO IT WHILE IT'S STILL MOVING YOU MET THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
Line_6550	HE PLACE IT UNDER WATER C AND THEN THE MALCAHOL CUP GOES UP OR DOWN
Line_6551	OW UM HOW MUCH HOW HOT OR COLD HOW HOT OR COLD THEY ARE IN CALCIUS
Line_6552	UM WE HAVE BEEN UM MEASURING VOLUEE UM AND WEIGHT YEAH
Line_6553	MARNEY I DON'T GET THAT
Line_6554	AND THE AND THE GRAMS WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM AND THE S PUNCH WOULD
Line_6555	I THINK THANKS FOR LETTING ME TEACH YOU BY MARNEY
Line_6556	OH HEAT TODAY WE MEASURED HOW MUCH WATER A SPUNCH CAN TAKE UP
Line_6557	WE USED GRAMS BECAUSE
Line_6558	I THINK THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT
Line_6559	HE METAL DISC WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6560	UM YEAH THAT'S SPACICUALLY YEAH
Line_6561	YEAH WE HAD THAT IN OUR CLASS AND THEN WE USED THE MOUTH
Line_6562	WELL THOSE LITTLE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND YOU LEAD THE TEMPERATURE THERE
Line_6563	ONE HUNDRED DEGREES UM IS
Line_6564	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER AND UM STUFF LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6565	GRAMS ARE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND D
Line_6566	YOU YOU COMPARE IT WITH THE NICKEL
Line_6567	UM W W STUFF EQUAL STUFF EQUAL
Line_6568	AND AND A TEN GRAMS EQUALS ONE TEN BIG GRAM
Line_6569	YOU FIRST PUT IN THE ORANGES AND THEN YOU
Line_6570	THE ORANGE WAS A LOT MORE THAN THOSE GRAMS
Line_6571	FIVE TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6572	UH WHICH ONE WAS HOTTER AND WHICH ONE WAS COLDER
Line_6573	THE ROBIA IS STICKING HIS FINGER IN CUP BE TO SEE IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_6574	IT MEANS THAT A IS UM IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM SEE AND SEE IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM BEAT
Line_6575	W WHICH ONE IS HOTTER
Line_6576	UM YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE UM THE TEMPERATURE OR YOU COULD DISCUSE YOUR FINGER
Line_6577	YOU STICK A THERMOMETER IN AND THEN IF THEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS
Line_6578	WE WANT TO USE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE WOULD NEVER KNEW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_6579	UM I CAN S UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_6580	YOU WOULD E LOOK UM CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT TEMPERATURE IT WAS
Line_6581	N SOME IT'S REALLY HOT AND ON SOME IT'S REALLY COLD
Line_6582	THE THERMOMETER IS S
Line_6583	DON'T REALLY KNOW THE WORD FOR IT
Line_6584	IT'S THE ALCAHOL
Line_6585	THE THE ICE WATER I MEAN THE ICE IT AMOUNTS IN THE WATER AND THEN IT MAKES IT AND THEN THE ICE MAKES IT COLDER
Line_6586	AND IT'S GETTING COLDER
Line_6587	W WE'VE BEEN DOING LIKE WEIGHING THINGS
Line_6588	WE PUT IT IN ONE SIDE ON THE SCALE AND THEN WE WEIGHED TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS BY PUTTING GRAM WEIGHTS ON THE OTHER SIDE
Line_6589	AND YOU CAN ADD MORE GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED OR TAKES OUT GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_6590	WELL IT TAKES LIKE THE DISC THE METAL DISC IS BALANCED WITH THE GRAMS WEIGHTS
Line_6591	WELL YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF DIFFERENT WELL YOU CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LOT OF DIFF
Line_6592	BINGS YOU CAN WATER AND ARE ARE THE PRETTY MUCH THE EASIEST ONES AND THE ONLY ONE IT WE'VE DONE
Line_6593	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS HOTTEST AND WHICH WAS COLDEST AND WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6594	HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_6595	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THEM SOME OF THE CUPS ARE GOING TO BE COLDER THAN A OTHERS
Line_6596	ITS
Line_6597	WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT WANTS TO EXPAND IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS HOT ER
Line_6598	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
Line_6599	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURES LAMP CAPSILY AND MASSES
Line_6600	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HONEST OR HOW COLD IT IS
Line_6601	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE WHICH WAS THE COURSE AND RICH ALL THE MEDIUM AND RICH WAS THE HARDEST I MEAN WARMEST
Line_6602	OW A IS IN CITTING ONE OF HIS FINGERS INTO THE CUP B
Line_6603	OH FIRST IT WAS A IN THE GAS THEN A DROP THEN FIVE DEGREES THEN THE EVENTUALLY RUN UP
Line_6604	EL THE OMIBATIONS ARE
Line_6605	WELL OBSERVATION THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS UM MAKE GRASS AND CHAT ABOUT THE THINGS AND YOU CAN GET MORE AND RATION ABOUT
Line_6606	I LIKE SCIENCE BEFORE MUCH AND SCIENCE IS MY FREE LEARNING SUBJECT
Line_6607	HUNDRED UH ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IS BOILING POINT SO THE WATER WILL BE BOILING
Line_6608	OILING IS BUILT OUT HAD
Line_6609	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPONGES CAN OBSORB
Line_6610	THE THE LEFT ONE IS DRY THE MIDDLE ONE IS WET AND THE RIGHT ONE IS SOAKED
Line_6611	ITS ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER
Line_6612	IT'S SORT OF CRACKLE S
Line_6613	IT'S WET SO IT MOVED IT'S WET SO IT MOVES MORE EASILY AND IT'S OBSORBED SOME WATER
Line_6614	E S PUNCH HAS GOT ON BIGGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS HARD
Line_6615	THE WATER DRIPS OUT AND IT GETS AND IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
Line_6616	WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITHOUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET
Line_6617	THE S PUNCH HAS OBSORBED WATER AND SO IT'S TIPPING THE BALANCE SCAR
Line_6618	THE SPUNGEL IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE
Line_6619	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE IT'S OBSEORBING WATER
Line_6620	GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONCH AND IT WAS EQUAL
Line_6621	WE HAVE MEASURED TEMPERATURE
Line_6622	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT OR HOW COLD THINGS ARE AND YOU CAN USE THERMOMETERS TO TELL
Line_6623	WHICH WAS THE COLDEST AND WHICH WAS THE WARM MOST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6624	WA S AND IF IT WAS THE COLDEST OR THE WARMEST
Line_6625	THE ROMAN IS TESTING CUP BE WITH HIS FINGER
Line_6626	IT MEANS THAT SOME HAVE HIGHER DEGREES THAN OTHERS AND THIS ROBOT IS TRYING TO TELL
Line_6627	WHICH ONE IS COLDEST WARMEST AND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6628	AND LIQUIDS AND SOME SOLIDS AND MOIST GASSES
Line_6629	MEASURED THE EXACT DEGREES AND HOW DIFFERENT ALL THE CLASS MEASUREMENTS WERE
Line_6630	IT SHOWS HOW MANY DEGREES THAT THE THING IT'S IN A RE
Line_6631	THEY SHOW HOW MANY DEGREES THE THING THAT THEY'RE ING IS
Line_6632	WE CAN USE SAL C US OR FAIR IN HEIGHT THESE THERMOMETERS SHOW SALCUS
Line_6633	WE WERE CHECKING THE CHANGES AND TEMPERATURE EVERY MINUTE
Line_6634	WE NOTICED SORT OF A SA THE SAME DEGREES AND IT'S SORT OF ROAD AFTER A FEW MINUTES SLOWLY
Line_6635	THE ICE COOLS WILL MOUNT AND THE WATER WILL GET WARMER
Line_6636	IT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE ICE CUBE IS FROSEN WATER SO IT'S COLD
Line_6637	I I SEE FIFTEEN DEGREES DIFFERENT
Line_6638	AND RIGHT IT DOWN OF COURSE SOR
Line_6639	I SEE THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN I LOT I LOT I LOT AND THEN SLOWLY GOING UPWARD
Line_6640	UM KIND OF JUST SOAKED UP ALL THE WATER THAT IT CAN HOLDS
Line_6641	MEAN IT'S KIND OF BEND JUST SOAKING UP WATER
Line_6642	UM MMM HE UN
Line_6643	I DON'T VEAUBLY KNOW WHAT A SOAP SPUNGE IS
Line_6644	THANKS MY ATE BYE
Line_6645	UM MANE UM MOLTIFICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6646	WE MEASURED HOW WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND SAW HOW COLD IT WAS
Line_6647	WE MEASURED HOW COLD IT WAS WITH THE THERMOMETER AND UM THE BEC WAS COLDEST
Line_6648	H HOW COLD AND HOW HOT IT WAS
Line_6649	OKAY WE WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD WITH THE WEIGHT WITH THE WEIGHT LAST WEEK
Line_6650	WE COULD USE A RULER AND MEASURE HOW HIGH IT WENT UP TOO
Line_6651	I COULD TELL US HOW HI THE CUP C THE CUP COULD HOLD WATER
Line_6652	A THE VOLUME OF LIQUID AND THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN
Line_6653	H HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_6654	HE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND THE CAPACITY THE CAPACITY'S HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD BUT THE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT'S HOLDING NOW
Line_6655	HI COULD FILL IT UP TO THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6656	WE COULD USE SYRINGE AND MEASURES HOW MUCH
Line_6657	YOU COULD USE A RING TO MEASURE IT
Line_6658	I DID THINK'S

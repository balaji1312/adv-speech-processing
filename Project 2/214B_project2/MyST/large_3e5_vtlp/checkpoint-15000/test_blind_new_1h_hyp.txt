Line_18	HOW ARE YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WO'LD LIKE THE PLANT PLANS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MUNKIY AND THE HALK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ARE CO THE THATERIA AND  FUNGIE IS  AR LIKE THE CONTHE D COMPOSERS
Line_20	PRODUCE MY OWN F BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS VETAL IT MAY SINKG ME IF I WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY OL ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FRUENDL
Line_21	I WELL IRON LIKE HAVE MY OWN THROUGH AND LIKE FROM AN ANIMAL LIKE LIKE YU SHA'LL LET SAY IF I WERE WELL SOMETHING LIKE A HAR I WOULD EAT THROUGH LIKE GLASS SOMETHING LIVING AND LIKE ONEOF MY PREDTORS WOULD BE LIKE A HOCK

Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PICTURES OF A DECOMWE OF DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT BULB LIKE DOGERDEMORNS KIND OF LIKE ON THE TOP THE FRTNIT AN
Line_27	OR ON THE VORG I THINKG E IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANT LIKE A YOU SAY LIKE BERRIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A ONDEVOR EATS ALL WELL SO IF UMMI IS THE PREFICT OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO ONYVORS ARE ANIMALS THAT EATS ALL THINGS LIKE MEATS FRUTS AND VECHTABLES

Line_38	MTROMADGAR
Line_39	SOME WISE
Line_40	L ACOLLUE NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS THIS ONE THING IT HELPS THEN BMAKE IT WATER IT DON'T
Line_41	BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS LIVING THING AND IT NEEDS WATER  YOU  THING YOU CAN JUST EGNORE JUSTHAP IT AND THEN THE BULB
Line_42	YES BECAUSE ITIS A BERGAR U THEYTHING TO BE COMPOSERS WHICH THEY NEED THIS KATTY DID NOT DCOMBLE IT BUT THEY MEAD O LIKE BERGLARS
Line_43	THAT PLANT'S THE LIVING
Line_44	WA

Line_73	A LEAFF
Line_74	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE SHOKES  THEYAN LIKE DIFFERENT WHERE AS IT GOES THE LEAVES A DIFFERENT SHAPE LIKE I REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WAS PARALLELL
Line_75	THERE THERE IS THREE TIPE RALIESE RMMMBER TWO OF THUM I DON'T WOANT OF THEM WAS A PARALLEL UNNOW THERE SPOALLMAPE
Line_76	DWELL THESE HAVE VAINS MIGHT THAT TRAVEL LIKE THE CA OR SOME THAT EVY THIS IS LIKE THE SAME THING HAS VAINS THAT ROWIL IN AUL A TWOE PANS
Line_77	ABOUT AMBLES AND HOW  CTRACTD D MOST OF THIS IS SUME AND HOVING GET NOTICED
Line_78	STRI SEE LIKE CUPS M SHAPE KIND OF AND AN I SEE LIKE ARCANGALERFRES AD STRPES
Line_79	THE SMELL
Line_80	IT USES ITS WEPED FEETS TO UM LIKE PUSH WATER THAT MAKES IT SWINM AND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES HELP BASICALLY CHUMP THE MEAT AND BRAKE IT DOWN INTO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOPLE GUESS LIKE T SO ITS BASICALLY SHOWING IT UNDER LIKE THE ANOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU NO
Line_83	THEUN
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS TNDS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP WAT NE TENS OF MITTALE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE HUGE SISTOM
Line_85	HE CAR COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF AWAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO AR SCIENCE PLY OR SCIENCE SCIENCE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE 'S A MOTOR AND LIKE WEALS AND STUFF AND UNS O STUFF THAT MAKES IT A BIG STICITIUM
Line_86	M THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE EZOST THEN THAT JUST SLITS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THATY DON'T NEED IN THE CAR AND THE WEAELES AND THE WEALS ARE WHAT MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_87	IT'S  HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SISTOMS LIKE YOUR MUSSLES AND YOUR HEART ON YOUR LUMNS AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_88	IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BEW WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW LIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE WE WOULN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HERT IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS US MAXE TURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STUMMIC
Line_89	THE ERTH IS A SISTOM BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SPEERS LIKE AHIDRO FIC SPEER THE JEO SPEER AND THE BIO SPEER AND THE HIDRAC AND THE ATMOUS FEER BUT THESO THOSE LITTALL  SUBE SISTOMS THEY MAKE UP ONE BIG SISTOM CALLED ERTH
Line_90	YEES I DO THINK IT'S A SYSTOM BECAUSE THERE IS THE HIDRO SFEER AND THE JGEO SFEER AND THE ATMOSFEER AND THE BIO SFEER AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG SICSTOM
Line_91	OK THE BIO SFEER IS THE LIFE AND TH AND LIKE THE TRES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND THE HIDRO SFEER IS THE WATER AND WE AN THE BIRO SFEER NEEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND THE ATMUS FEER IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKIY  SO AND THEN THE JEO SFEER IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEED THE JEO STHATT  THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE JEO SFEER SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE BIRO SFEER NEEDS THE HIDRO SFEER  WE AN THE BIRO SFEER NEEDS THE ATMUS FEER BECAUSE WE NEEDS SOME OF THE AIR THAT'S UP THERE AND THE HIDRAGOM POUCT WHATEVER THE STUFLE BREETH AND WE NEED THE HIDRO SFEER BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD BE PUT OF THE BIRO SPEER AND THE TRES THATSALSOBVE SPEER AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE JEOSFEER I CAN SEE THE SKUY WHICH IS THE HIGTR'S NO HEIGHJA ATMOSFEER AND THEN THE WATER RI UM UN THE BOTTOM M IT THE HIDRO SEER
Line_93	THE ERTH
Line_94	THERE ARE BOR SISTUMS THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIDRO SFEER AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECOND ONES THE JEO SFEER AND THAT'S THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BO SFER AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE IN TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOS FEERE WI KNOW THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOUS FEERE WHICH IS LIKE THE SKUY
Line_95	I SEE A LOT OF LIKE U BIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES AND THAT ONES SPOT LIKE ANIMALS OR TRES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITH OUT THE WET LANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER AND WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STOF THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WET LANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HAPPET TAP SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAR TO THE ANIMALST
Line_97	THERE IS LIKE  FORIST AND STUFF WHICH AIRS USUALLY LIVEN THERE S LIKE TENDRS WHICH IS LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACES WHOULD PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HIDRESFEER WESN'T HERE BECAUSE MTHAT'S THE HIDRSFEER WE WOULD NEED M THE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS SSNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE IS LIKE M ANIMAL SAND I THINKT'S A FOOD WEB BECAUSE THETHERE IS THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND THE T THE GRASS EATS AND  THEN THERE IS LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOCXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOODWEB
Line_99	FOULBLAINS A FOUND WAIB
Line_100	WHAT EATS WH AND WY WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATCS W AND WHAT DOESN'T EAT ANY THING AND IT JUST GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THE LIKE IT  THE AROWS MEAN WHAT  EATS THAT ONE THING SOSORT IT JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DO IT LIKE IT SHOWES ME LIKE IF I HAVE LIKE A TESTE OR SOMETHING AND IT SAID WHAT DOES THE BUNNY EAT I COULN LOOK AT OF FOOD WHEREVER AND IT SHOWES THAT BUNNIES EATS SCRASS SO IT SHOWES AT IT SHOWS YOU WHT IT EATS W AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE FUNG IS STUFF IN THE MLES AND GRASS AND PINCOIGNES AND STUFF
Line_103	M HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGS M FUNGS   FUNGES GETS EATEN BY PINCONES AND PINGLES GET PINCONES GET EATEN BY THE BARK BEDLES AND THE BARK BDLES GET EN BY THE BRYIDS BY THE SALIMANDOR AND THEN THE SALIMETORS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RAP AND THE SAND THE RAPIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RAET ALSO GETS EATEN BY E HOT RED TAILE HOCKS AND THEAND SPERROWS ARE EATEN BY RETAILE HOCKS SO IT'S SPASICALLY JUST THE BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS WY AND WHAT DOES IT W AND ALL SORTS OF OER CLOE SINGERS
Line_104	UN
Line_105	I'VE BEEN STUDIING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO M IN THE DARK OR IN THE LIGHT
Line_106	M THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING CAUSE EST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE CERTAIN LIVE WORK SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS  AND SCYSTMS THATS  SINCE SINCE EST IS HA LIVING THING AN HEN THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAET AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR EAST IS STORMAN SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOD IT WILL IT'LL BRETH AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IT WILL PROVE UP
Line_107	M THE ESE E HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND  THE EST ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO AND IT'S DORMENT SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SCREESE SOMEWELL PUT AT THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN  THE EST WILL WAKE UP AND IT 'LL STORT BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL PROOF
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BRETHING BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE DOSC IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BRETH AND WHEN THEY BRETH WHERE EVER THEY ARE IF ITS IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BAGGELE POOF UP SO ITLS SHOW THAT THEY'RE BREETHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND THEIF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS HITS FOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO TA BUBBLE UP ANEAL MOST SO MAY SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT JUST AWAY THAT WE WOULD MAYBE WE COULD WELL SINCE IT'S A LIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS E
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YELLOW AND SON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN SO IT WILL HSO IT'LL DIVE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN M SHINS ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE THEN SOMEON'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THE  THEN THE WATER AND THE SUN AN GIVES IT IT'S FOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLYLL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER HEL AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THE UH MAKES IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS THEIR FOD
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN  THE PLANT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NEW TRANS FROM THE SOIL AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THES ERTH  THE SUN GOES ON TO THE LEAFE AND IT WILL OBSORBD THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE U SHOOGAR AND THAT'S FOOD
Line_115	UM I THINK THE PLANT UM MEANS THAT I DON'T WELL YOU I THINK THAT PLANT NEEDS THE AIR BECAUSE WELL I SIMPLY KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND UM I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BRETH AIR O AND THE PLANS UM THE PLAN M THE PLANS HAN E BRETHS OR SOMETHING BREETHS THE CARBONDIOCXIDE A IING THAT WE BREETH OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BRETHE THE EAR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BRETH THE CARBONDIOCSIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND THEPLANTS NEED THE SUNS TO SERVIVE BECAUSE WITH OUT THE SUN MIHT THEY WON'T BE THEY WOULN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THEM LOOK GREEN AND THEAND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS LIKE THEIR FOOD
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBLOM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLAN PLANTS NEEDS SUN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN THEY CAN PRODUCE SHUGER AND IF THEY CAN PRODUCE SHIGER WHICH IS THEIR FOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBERGER AND A HAMBERGER IS SOME THING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEED BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND THEY DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	UM IF WE DON'T FEED IT FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLUM Y UM IF IT WASN'T UM MAKING ITS OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLUM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED E FIRTALISER BECAUSE FIRTALIZER IT'S LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN AND WITH OUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NEW TRANTS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEED U FRTALISER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND THEI THINK PLANTS ARE GOIN NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE USUALLY HAS A BACK YARD AND IF IT HAS A BACK YARD THAT MEANS THAT'S PROPARBLY DIRT AND THAT'S SOMEWHEIRE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE SFOUD
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE TH IF IT RAINES THAT GIVES THEM WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THAT WHEN IT'S SUNY THE IT GIVES THEM THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING  THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THEY'LL GET THE WATER AND THEPLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUNDY THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUN  IT'S THE SUN GIVING OF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANTS GETTING FROM THE COVERDZIOCIDE AND AND NEW TRANEN FROM THE DERT AN ITS RUTS AND  IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREETH
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DREANK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES I IT GIVES IT ITS FOOD ECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH FOTO CYMTHACIS AND THETHE CARBDYOCIDE IT IT USS THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BRETHS AND IT BRINGS OUT AND IT BREETHS OUT OCCIGIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE BRETHE SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH  PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED IT BECOME DIOCID CARBONDYOCCIDE AND WHEN WE SPEEK WE LET SOME THER CARBON DYOCCIDE OUT AND THEN THEY'LL PRODUCE OCIGIEN FOR US
Line_130	THEY OBSORBED THE SUMMIT AND THEY NED THEIR CARBONARY OCCIDES SO THAT THEY CAN BREETH AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SHGER AND THAT S SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY REED OUT THE OCIGON AND THAT'S THE STUFF WEET BRETH
Line_131	YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT ERIND THEY MAKE THAT IN SOME FOOD AND THEN THEY BREETH A CRD ACID AND THEN THE WATERS STRIPS THE WATER THROUGH THEM
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS AN PRODUCE SHOGER BECAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT'S THE SHOGER SO IT'S DIVING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN MAKE ITS FOOD AND IF IT CAN' MAKE ITS FOOD THEN IT CAN'T REALLY IT DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING TO EATN IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TO THANYTHING TO CAN EAT IT'LL DIVE
Line_134	NOT AN SIGN
Line_135	UM IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIEND OR AIR AND WITH OUT THE WIND ER AIR IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREEATH SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREEATH IT'S JUST GOING TO DIVE
Line_136	IT CAN'T BRETH SO IT DIVES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVELE UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITHOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WE NEED WATER AND FO WATER FOED AND WAND OCIGON TO TO SERVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIVE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OCIGEN AND THE WATER IT NEEDS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND IT CAN BREETH SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	THE LESST THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THROUGH THE THINGS IT NEEDED SO THAT SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY  THEY COULDN'T REALLY PRODUCE THEIR FOOD OR DRINK OR BREETH THE OCIGIEN THAT THEY NEED BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREETH THE OCIGEN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GON BE HELPTHIER THAN THOSE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT STARTS OUT AS WHA IT EATS IT'S OWN FOD AND WHATEVER ET MAKES ITSON FOD M THATS AND IF IT MAKES ITS OWN FOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOD
Line_142	LIAKE MAPLE TRES   MAPE BELIEAVE  MAPE BELEVES AND THEN THERE IS LIKE PARALLELL LEAVES AND THATS DISC LIKE THE VAINS AND THEN THERE IS  THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WERE THERE IS ONE VMAIN VAINO AIN VAINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THEN MORE VAINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE VMAIN VAN AND THEN JDVAT ONE VAIN COMING OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONES VANS ARE PARALLELL MTHE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GOE STREIGHT THE ONE THEREIS ONE VAIN THAT GOES STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS AND THEN ONE HAS THERE IS MORE THAN LIKE ONE VAIN VAIN BECAUSE THEN THE IS MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE VMAIN VAIN AND THEN ONE VAIN COMING OUT OF IT BUT THAN THAT ATL DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE H'S JUST UM HAS A TUNH OF JUST TUNH OF THE VAIN'S GOING STRAIT AND THEN THE OTHER TO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIHT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS SOMETIMES THERE W'LL BE MORE COMING OUT OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE ONE WHERE IT JUST GOES STRAIHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANY MORE EXCEPT FOR THATW
Line_145	ON ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PARALLELL IS PARALLELL UM AND THEN OTHER TWO AR AND THEY J THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE PARALLEL BUT UM THEN IT THERE IS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN IN ONE AND THEN  A FEW OTHER VAINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VAIN BUT THEN NOTHING COMEING OUT OF THE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE WITH E UM NOT WITH THE MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS MORE VAINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	UM THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS PENNATE UM ITS KIND OF LIKE A FETHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THINGS COMING AND VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN THING BUT THAT NO VAINS COMING OUTOF THOSE ONES THAT ARN'T THE MAIN THING AND THEN PALMAT IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A TUN OF VAINS ALL OVER SO THERE IS AND THERE 'S MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAIN SO THAT MEANS THERE'S EXTRA VAINS AND THEN PARALLELL IS JUST A TURN OF PARALLELL UM VAINS
Line_147	THIS IS THETHIS IS THENESS IS THE PNATE AND  IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN MORE VRAINS COMING OUTOF THAT ONE MAIN BEAIN
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TIPES LEAVES UM PRODUCES U MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SHOOGER AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS ORAND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_149	TO CARRY SHOOGER TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARRYES IT TO THE ROUTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROUTS CAN SEND IT UP IN MORE VAINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE BEAT ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TIPES OF VAINS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SHOOGEAR TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE BAINS IN THE LEAVES M HOW ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKES THE SHOGER FROM THE FOTO CYMTHECIS AND ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT PIEACE OF THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOOD AND THEN SO THAT IT CAN FEED ITSELF ON EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK ITS SHOWING THAT THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT TIPS OF VAINS AND ONE IS CALLED THE POLUM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SHOOGER TO THE PLANTS AND THETHE OTHER ONE IS THE SILUM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT B THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICXTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STAY IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP INTO THE REST OF THE PLANTS MTHROUGH ONE VAIN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ZILUM AND THEN ALL THE NEW TRENTS AND SAP MEAIY BE AND SHOOGER IS GOING THROUGH THE THE FOLUM UM TO THE RUTS
Line_154	M IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WEVE BEEN G TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES IN EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLOODWOOD IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PPLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THAT PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF AND EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT BEAND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE ZI IT PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT'S JUST LETS THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT WAISTE B BECAUSE IN THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED MINTO THE BAG BECAUSE M THE PLANT S UM THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T RE CIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANT IT JUST M EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S WATER ON THAT
Line_158	BIEME
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALLSO KIND HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SYISTOMS AND HWHAT THEY'E ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SCUNK IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND I TURNALS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND SO OE
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COLORS AND SHAPES AND THEPROBABLY DIFFERENT SISTOM S ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE  MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAIN COLLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A WARNING NOT TO EAK AT ANIMAL OR SOMET
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IS PROPERLY WHAT THEY'RE GONG TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO I THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS IT'S WHAT THEY' ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL UM TURTALS THEY LIKE T THEY M THEY'RE UP ON LAMS SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTALS CAN M AND THEY KIND OF CAMIFLAS AMMIFLAS SOMETIMES BUT UM YOU CAN M SE TURTAL LIKE TURTALWELL TURTALS THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER M AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTALS WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND SOESO THEY CAN SEE EACH OTHER UM AND THEN THE FISH ARE REALLY BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEAN DON'T EAT ME TO CREDITERS IN THE OTION OR THEY JUST WANT TO FIND A MEAT AND THEN SCUNKS THEY HAVE WHIGHT THEIR WHIGHT AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLY TO SHOW HAY DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR ILL THEAVE STICK EVERYWHEARE SO
Line_165	YES I DO
Line_166	UM PEOPL THE ANIMALS DON'T WANT TO EAT THE SCUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED O THAT HELPS THE SCUNK STAY ALIVE
Line_167	OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHEL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP CREDITERS FROM GETTING INTO IT SO IT CAN HIDTE IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDITERS CAN'T EAT IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO IK SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUE  FETHERS U IF I SAW BLUE FETHERS THATD BE ATCATTRACTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ALL SOR ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HA I'M POISONOUSS OR HAH A MITALE IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GOING TO SPRY YOU OR HYOU DON'T WANTO EA ME I DON'T TASTE GOOD SOME LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DOCK DIDN'T HAVE FEET WEPBED FEET IT COULDN'T PADDTL THROUGH THE WATER AND IF IT COULDN'T PADDL THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO THAT THE FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTAN'T PARTO
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIENTS DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BEGUM AND WITHOUT IF AND WITH OUT THER TEETH IT THEY CAN' EXACTLY LIKE GRAVEL AND ANTALOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD JUST KOI TO SMOCE IT A LITTLE BIT

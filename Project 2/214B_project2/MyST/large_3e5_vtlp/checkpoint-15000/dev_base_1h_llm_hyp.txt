Line_0	I I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CANNETCIC ENERGIES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DISVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELLS SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK I NEVER MINI
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULB LIT
Line_7	CARNETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE IT
Line_10	THE NEGATIVITY SIN
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN
Line_13	I NOTICED THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COOL
Line_14	ERRY OHSUMNIS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A POLE A CIRCUIT
Line_16	IT'S THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT A F COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUN'S ENERGY OABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MO TO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORB ENERGY FROM THE HUM AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUNS TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT THIS MAKES GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IN THE CIRCUIT ITS ENERGY
Line_25	B METAL OR A COPPER OR A STEEL
Line_26	THE MAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PINKIE STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE RULE IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE PAS WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT JUST ESTABLISH IT IN A
Line_30	MADE OF MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS MENTAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN MATE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH E
Line_33	ILATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL IT
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONCONNECTIONS AND HOW A
Line_36	RAY BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND THAT SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAX MILK
Line_38	IT WHICH IS THE THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING
Line_40	IS BURNING AND FLAMING AND
Line_41	UM USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS ONE GOING ON A HATCH BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	SOUND IT'S PRODUCING OF GIVING IT ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HEAR SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT OTHER S
Line_44	GIRL IS WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS A KIND OF PAREL BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	W WILL BURN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS THE SOLAR POWER CA
Line_47	IT WILL COME FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR ROUNDER TO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO TRY THAT TRANSFERING TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	OKAY TIME WE SKIP THIS S
Line_49	NONE WERE USABLE
Line_50	THIS IS ONLY A ONE TIME USED AND COAL IS JUST AND COAL IT'S IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT A LONG TIME
Line_51	VERY WELL NOT SITTING A I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	CIRCUITS AND EH WE'LL TO
Line_54	I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS ITS STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICED THAT I SEE THAT IT IS A CLEAR CUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT'S GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY READ IT CON
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IN IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RATDICAL WAY
Line_59	BRIGHTER OR BEER TO COMPLICATE IT
Line_60	THAT'S A I DO NOT KNOW A RIVER
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	LAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN
Line_65	IT IS THE COAT CLOCK
Line_66	UH NO SIME
Line_67	NOW I
Line_68	I BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL ARE MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPER CONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	UH I DON'T NOT
Line_73	UM SORRY AND BITSY AND I DON'T WITH LE HAVE TIMES FOR THE A
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BISY REALLY BISY YEAH
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE IS
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONES IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS ALUMINIUM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE ENDS
Line_78	D I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE LET ME HURRY UP
Line_79	STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS
Line_80	I'M COLORBLINE I'M COLORBLINE SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH IS GREY
Line_81	MATALIC I UM S
Line_82	THEY ARE VERY METRIC AND VERY MATALIC
Line_83	MAGNETS
Line_84	THEY WOULD REPEL OBVIOUS E
Line_85	I
Line_86	IT'S SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
Line_87	THEY ARE SIMILAR BE IT NEVER MIND CAN WEI MOVE ON
Line_88	SOME ARE REPELLING AND SOME ARE ATTRACTING AND THEN THE STRAARLA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Line_89	A A PERSON WITH THE COMPASS
Line_90	BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC
Line_91	ITS IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_92	BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
Line_93	BECAUSE THEY HAVE UP THE IT POLES AND POLES ATTRACT
Line_94	MAGNET IT'S HARD FOR MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK
Line_95	IT IS NOT STICKING
Line_96	BECAUSE WE LEARN THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_97	THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
Line_98	METAL AND MAGNETISM
Line_99	ONE A MAGNET
Line_100	MAGNETISM
Line_101	IT WOULD NOT BE MAGNETISM NO MORE LONGER S STUFF
Line_102	HUH NOT VERY MUCH
Line_103	MAGNETISM
Line_104	THE FLOW OF MAGNETISM IS GOING
Line_105	MAGNETIC FORCE THE IT DID IT TO OR THE HAND
Line_106	THE MAGNET TURNS OFF IT TURNS OFF SO IT'S D O D
Line_107	-MAGNETISM
Line_108	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T CARE
Line_109	IT IS HAPPENING
Line_110	I OBSERVED THAT THE SPACERS ARE LIKE PREVENTING THE MAGNETIC FIELD YEAH
Line_111	MURTH MO MOST MO MOST MOST M
Line_112	EMAGNETIC
Line_113	SPREADING APART
Line_114	MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_115	MY MIND IS BLOWN BY MISS STERCHE
Line_116	SPACERS SWEATERS SICERS S
Line_117	WALKING JOYFULLY
Line_118	IGNETIC FORCE MAG LETS
Line_119	HOW I CAN I PUT THEM TOGETHER PLEASE TELL ME
Line_120	THEN SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN I GARENTE
Line_121	I AND IDEA WHAT'S TALKING ABOUT ARE YOU PROUD OF ME BROTHER
Line_122	I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL I DIDN'T SAY THAT IT'S ALL
Line_123	-MAGNETISM
Line_124	THE STANDS MINUTES
Line_125	BECAUSE UM A THE DUE DUE IS THE DUE DUE DUE IS U MOCKERS
Line_126	ITCH THAT'S WHY OUT WASN'T WORK GETTING BECAUSE IF DON'T HIT THE SWIPE GETS IT
Line_127	IT'S NOT A MAGNET ANYMORE OP LIKE A
Line_128	SORRY THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES JUST LEAVING A LOUD LEAVING A LOUD BUT YOU'RE HURTING ME
Line_129	DAVIDSDAVIDS FLURTING WITH THE GATHER
Line_130	DAVID WAS FLOATING WITH THE CURL DAVED WAS FLOATING WITH HIBERFLOW DAVINDS FLOATING WITH THE GIRL
Line_131	AIPADIS
Line_132	EVERY THING THERE'S A SEE DEE AND YOU RE
Line_133	CURLY I DO SHOW PLOPATON
Line_134	RAPIDS I CHEESE
Line_135	IT'S THINGS
Line_136	I'M GOOD TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT WORDS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	THE WIRES AND THEY TRY THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE TO LIGHT THE BATTERY NO TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST LIKE A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY AND A CIRCUIT B
Line_141	THEY TRANSFERED ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMS IT INTO LIGHT ENERGY
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STUCK BY THE POS
Line_146	IGHT THE ENERGY FLOW TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITIES FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BOTH WEIGHS EVEN THOUGH THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCH
Line_149	I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAD TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB CASING IN THE BULB C
Line_151	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCE S
Line_152	H THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE A MOTOR
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT'S THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED FROM STORED ENERGY TO CANNETIC ENERGY
Line_155	ITS COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	HE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BOARD
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECTS ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FACING THE SUN LIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THUS THEN THE SOLAR SHALL COLLECT
Line_165	WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT A
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE IS NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T RUN
Line_167	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THERE IT IS WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT OF THE B
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THINGS
Line_171	A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
Line_172	THERE IS A A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
Line_173	ALLY METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_174	ALL OF THE METALS AND THE LISTS ARE CONDUCT RE TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_175	A ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_176	THE CIRCUIT RUNS
Line_177	I MAKES A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_178	ALS METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_179	A CIRCUIT WITH THE INSULATOR INSULATE ELECTRICITY THEREFORE THE INSULATOR THE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_180	INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL S THEREFORE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_181	THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_182	WHEN I ADD IT INSULATORS TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
Line_183	CLOSE
Line_184	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_185	THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
Line_186	OOD
Line_187	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT W HOW ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_188	IT IT POWERS THINGS LIKE TOASTER AND COMPUTORS
Line_189	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE WAX MELTING
Line_190	THEY'RE CAN THI MOUNTS
Line_191	IT FELT VERY HOT
Line_192	THEY HAD NO SOUNDS
Line_193	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALTERNATS ENERGY SOURCES
Line_194	IT POWERS EVERYTHING FROM CARS TO TOSTORS
Line_195	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE MAXWELLS MELTING
Line_196	THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THEREFORE THE WAX IS MELTING
Line_197	THERE WERE NO SOUND
Line_198	SINCE THE PERSON IS PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUMS ITS MAKING SOUND
Line_199	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THERE FORE SHE'LL NEED ENERGY FROM THE APPLE TO EAT
Line_200	CANDLE APPLES WOOD AND SIX GOES IN THE FIELD
Line_201	IT GETS LACK AND FLY
Line_202	THE SOLAR CELL DOES NOT ABMITS SMOKE BUT THE GASOLINE DO S
Line_203	THE NAME FOR NON RENEWABLE BUILDS IS FOSSIL FUELS
Line_204	THEY CAN BE USED FOR EVERY
Line_205	THEY THEY WORK TO
Line_206	THEY BURNS AND THEY GIVE OFF SMOKE
Line_207	ONE IS A LIQUIDS AND ANOTHER IS A SOLID

Line_212	COAL GAS AND SOIL
Line_213	A PARALLEL IS A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_214	SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_215	E THE LIGHT BULB TAKES IN ENERGY AND TAKES OUT ENERGY
Line_216	TO TIP YOU TO TO TO TOY TOE TOE
Line_217	I NEED TO S HELP
Line_218	THEY ALL HAVE TWO BATTERIES YEP
Line_219	Y THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MANY MORE WIRES STRING FOR ENERGY WILL INS
Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRE S
Line_221	COURSE THERE IS TWO BATTERY ENDS
Line_222	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE TO POLES
Line_224	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_225	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_226	THE SIMILARITY OF MAGNETS THAT ATTRACTS EACH OTHER ARE THAT THEY'RE NO
Line_227	ERT'S MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_228	THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT A COMPECE THAT USES THE ERTHS MAGNETIC POLES
Line_229	RING ABOUT MAGNETS AND OTHER STUFF
Line_230	WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETIN MAGNETIC FIELDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_231	THE MAGNETIC FIELDS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER ER FOR MAKING THE PAPER CLIP THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE MAG
Line_232	ON THE FIRST THIN STACK THE POWER CAN GO THROUGH IT BUT WITH THE SIXTH AC IT CAN

Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTORS
Line_263	THEY ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_264	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER US
Line_265	IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THEY'RE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER IN TO A CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY F BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFER AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILAMENTS IN THE GETS SO HOT THAT IT'LL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL OR THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_277	SENT THE ELECTROFLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_279	WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULBS STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELLS THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT POINTS WOULD NOT GET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN OFF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	SINCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH- WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IT IS HAPPENING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN BAT THE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSFER ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT POINT S
Line_289	BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT'S OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW CAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN'T FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	ITS OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	THE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUN'S ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	E ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THIS SUN LIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR SHELL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCU-
Line_300	A MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS STRING CAUSE NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	WEILL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	FIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SUMMARY CONDUCTORS STUMAR INSULATOR
Line_306	ALLY THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE UM THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UM IF YOU PUT AN INSULATOR UM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE OPTICAL SI DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	INSULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE A LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE IN ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_313	THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY A LIGHTING LIKE A PATHWAY
Line_314	ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS INTO MOTION OR LIGHT OR SA
Line_315	YOU'RE CANDLE BURNING SWEET
Line_316	HUH BURNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO SEE WAX MELTING
Line_317	SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING CAN A SIZZL
Line_318	THE HEAT IS DING FROM THE WITH AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
Line_319	IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF HEAT AND MAKING WIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A UM ER SOME CAN A NOISE TH THAT SAYS ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE DRUM TO MAKE IT RELEACE A SOUND
Line_322	WELL THE PERSONS BURNING CALORIES WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_323	WOOD GASES FOOD AND CANDLES
Line_324	IT WILL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND EVEN WATER
Line_325	K IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENTALLY RAN
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I I AM NOT SURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUT DOOR THING
Line_330	THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND RELLE SMOG
Line_331	THEY POLLUTE THE RTHLUSL OR PANELS DO NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT LO
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY Y
Line_338	THESE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE POWER TO GET THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FACE THE THE SAME POOLITARY
Line_344	PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR A NEGATIVE TO POSIT
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WAYS IN THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEN FLOWS IN TWO WAYS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED AND THE SAME CIRCU
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BAT THEN THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY IN AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	E EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWDER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUIT ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NOW ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE THE C
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BURRNS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF UM THE FILAMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN A ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILAMENT IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OF TWO
Line_368	A FILLIEMENT BRAKES AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW S STOPS
Line_370	THE B FILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	THIS PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORK BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN EASILY A REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE AND AND IT STAYS ON
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNED WHICH IS LIKE AN OPEN ST
Line_375	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED IN A PATHWAYS
Line_376	WE'LL UM
Line_377	THE FILAMENT BROKE SO UM SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S IN SERIES
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE IT LIKE AN OPEN SWI-
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARNED HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S EITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BE CAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	A MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON NAIL STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	O CASE THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT OR AND AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DOES S
Line_390	T WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT IT'S IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL ONE MET
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	I THINK IT'S ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ONE TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A CRACK
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE A NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLE'S ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THEY BOTH POLES THAT ARE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPASS SHOWING NORTH ON THE EARTH
Line_402	S SOME ONE USING A COMPASS TO FIND WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FOLLOWS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTED METAL THAT IS DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRON
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POLES AND OPPOSITE POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULLS BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TWOS THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE NAILS
Line_410	THE MAG OF A PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE E
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING AREAN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	AN PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZES EVERYTHING AS A TEMPORARY MAGNETS
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	M MAGNETISM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPERCLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BREAKING WITH WEIGHT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN ST
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FOR BECAUSE IT IS TOO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHTS
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AW A
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT LEAKENS THE MAGNETIC F
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	IT IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAK
Line_427	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANCE
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACERS
Line_429	ITS MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WRAP THE CORD WITH A WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZES THE COIL
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETTING COST INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAINAGE BECAUSE ELECTRO MAGNETS USE A TURN OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE S THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER
Line_438	ITS MAGNETIZES THE COAL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COILS TO MAGNETIZE IT
Line_440	BUT THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL TO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETIZE THE THE RIVET
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	YES THESE ARE WIRES SO
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THE
Line_448	IT IS A SOURCE
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULBS
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE- IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	EN I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	WIRES ARE A PATHWAY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
Line_455	ERS CARRY ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY MIGHT THESE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE BULBS LIGHT
Line_458	THIS
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES ONTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	ACTIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SAID
Line_461	ITS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUMP ON IT
Line_462	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE IN THE CLOSING TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FORMED TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRI- THE FLOW GOES THE OTHER WAY
Line_466	UH JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL AS
Line_467	OTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THEY THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG W
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES AND ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH IN THIS PICTURE IS UP AND
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IT'S RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL BLOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICED THAT THE MOTOR T RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	TH THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THEY THING IS
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY IN THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THEN THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I CLICK ON IT AGA
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR A STOP THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_492	THE SOLAR SILL DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THIS SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SAND IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANEL
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS STITTLING
Line_498	T THE NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR KEEPS SPINNING THEN THE PAPER CLIP BRIDGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPSICLE STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING G
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	UN LELOCA
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSED I SAY IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_509	M CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	THINK THAT UM THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE FAX THE WAX IS MOUNTED TO
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT AND I
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELTIN
Line_517	I I SEE A FLAME
Line_518	IT'S IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	UM SOMEONE IS DRUMMING
Line_520	S SHE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEAR IT AND YEAH
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WALK
Line_524	I THINK THAT'S STUFF FLOW IN IT
Line_525	GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	OH
Line_528	UM THE SOLAR SELLS THE TURBINE NO
Line_529	STEM
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NOT RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTED
Line_532	UM THE COLD GASPILLA LUITES THE AIR
Line_533	UM COIN GAS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	UM THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CLOSE
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN'T STOPS
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND A CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULBS
Line_541	M ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_542	BLUE DOT THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY HELP THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERY WEARED
Line_544	ONE UH
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WE'LL NEAR MORE WIRES A
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHT TOO
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT BRIGHTER
Line_548	IN THE THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT TWO IN THE RIGHT
Line_549	I SEE THAT U
Line_550	BY HOW YOU ARE THE BUTIFAL IS LADY IN THE WATER
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHTEN ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	T
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULB WELL WE TIED
Line_556	NOISE GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE PUT THE POSITIVE AMOUNT THROUGH WATER
Line_557	THAT'S IS VOLTRYBECAUSE IT REACTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES IN THROUGH THE S HEY RED OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE S UGLY A STWARMIN
Line_559	THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THE VERY QUILEY
Line_562	N YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS I
Line_563	THEY ARE BRAIN
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO RACILIA ONLY GOES LONG BULB
Line_565	T THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL UH
Line_570	THEY THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS IN THE R
Line_571	THERE IS ONE BULB THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OR PATHWAY THERE A A TWO PATHWAY
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAYS
Line_574	UN THEY ARE THEY'RE ON POWDER
Line_575	THE THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DAM
Line_576	UM I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTER
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE DRY YOU ARE THE DEFEND
Line_578	THE UM THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY LOST ALL
Line_579	THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOWING
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEG
Line_582	THE IT IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSI- AND OUT THROUGH THE N
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEG
Line_584	I DID NOT SHARE YOU SO PRET YU SAY IT AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO WHOLE PATH WAYS AND THEY ARE GON
Line_586	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT'S
Line_587	IT LAHTHTHS LONG ON
Line_588	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES IN
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICK
Line_590	UH THE POPLAMS ARE BRIGHTER THEN THE BOTTOM LUNGS
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE THAT W
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D CELL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES IN BOTH OF HUM
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEED A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE LIT SO WE NEED THE POWRALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SCARY IS THE ERUET
Line_596	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU MY BUT
Line_597	I FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND ATTRACTS THAN OBVIOUSLY BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE RAFEGREAL WEIGHT ALL
Line_600	CAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
Line_601	THE NAIL THING IS STICKING ONTO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT IT IS MADE OF IT MAYBE NOT
Line_603	WOOD Y ONE PLASTIC YEAH I
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT SO IT DOES NOT A
Line_607	THEY BOTH ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL ST YOU THINK THAT
Line_608	WOULD YOU THEY ARE BOTH MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL I
Line_610	I TOLD YOU IRON MAGNETS STICK TO IRON ONE OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OF IT STICKS
Line_612	UH ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE THE STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL IN THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET I DON'T KNOW
Line_615	I I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY IN THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LEARNT TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FINE HA ARE
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND SETS
Line_623	THES MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IF BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVED EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY REPEL
Line_628	THE SAME SIDE ARE TOUCHING E
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPASS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND SOUTH SAME AS ON EARTH A NOYSFUL AND A SOUTH POOL
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASE I
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRETTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY JUST STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	I CAN NOT FELT THE WE THE EGG GO
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL E MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL ACT A TEMPORARY MAG
Line_640	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	HI DON'T KNOW
Line_642	WELL IT IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	WAUSE BECAUSE IT ISN'T THE NAIL I MEAN IT ISN'T THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BLOW STUFF MEAN THAT IT HAS A
Line_646	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	I'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_650	THES THERE ISN'T ENOUGH HOWEVER I AM
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON B SIDE THEN THE MIX P
Line_652	THEY ARE A WASHER NO THEY'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO INTO THE A CUP
Line_654	M THAT YOU CAN PUT SPACERS IN
Line_655	IT ME AS THE MAGNETIC FORCE BE EAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENS THE FORISTS
Line_657	I I DO NOT NOW
Line_658	PUSH AND COIN RAP
Line_659	YOU PUT SPACER SIR
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LAS HE AND LAS
Line_662	WE'LL MAKES THE FORCE THE MAGNETIC FLOW WEAKER
Line_663	GOUD
Line_664	WE'VE AND SAND HOW ALL RIVETS CAN PICK UP WASHER
Line_665	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WILL UHM IT'S A CLOUD OR NOT
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE LIGHT'S SHOW FILL HERE
Line_671	IT'S BOTTLE NO OLCA
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MANY
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	T HERE IS LOSS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	AMOUNT OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
Line_676	ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVER MAKE A MAG AN ELECTRO-MAGNET
Line_677	UM I CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THING THE COULDN'T PICK UM STOP
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT DIS ROLE IN THE STEEL RIPET
Line_681	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BILLION TIM
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN OUT WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS S SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN'T
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY'S TO MAKES A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_687	THEY HALF C I WON'T
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET T
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
Line_691	THEN IT CAN BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEAT UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHTS
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU'RE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULB S
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CAN IT EATS THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB IN BACK
Line_697	WITHOUT THE WIRES M THERE WOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD NOT LIGHT OFF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_698	THAT IT HAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY AN ELECTRICITY FROM THE THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTER
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM WHAT YOU NEED ELECTRICITY THAT TURNS ON AND OFF AND ONE AND THEN
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECT ELECTRICITY SIDE LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WITH IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHT IT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVERALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE BLUE BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS BULBS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE KNOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	LU REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU DISATTACH ONE OF THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BASE CIRCLE SO DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE EIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S LIT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NO LE EVEN WE'RE HEAR ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE ENERGY FROM THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATTERY
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR END BACK TO THE BATTERY ER THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW AL THE WAY
Line_714	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING A CAN AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WE'LL LEARN ABOUT YESTER
Line_715	THIS IS A A SWITCH IT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE B
Line_717	THE MOTOR DOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY CAN WORK THE SUNS ENERGY AND E ELECTRICITY THAT YOU COULD NE
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	E ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WORE IT WOULD NOT HER THE THIS THE SINCE A
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF A SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUN'S ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET A L
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREW
Line_727	WHERE IS A SCREW IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PA PAPER CLIP IS COMPLETING THIS A CIRCUIT
Line_729	ACTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRAFT STICK IS MAKING A DIFFERENT SO T THE STILL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRAP STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT OBSORBES ALL OF IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR POR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS SO BUT IT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT'S STEEL THAT COMPLETING
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARAL REA PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_739	FOR A THE LIGHT BULBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN MIDDLE CIRCUIT IT'S THAT SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A L COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	WELL THERE THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATING CAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING TO SAME WAY W GOING TO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GOING IT'S ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONES
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOULD CAN SPLIT IT OFF INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	COMES FROM THE COM FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSIT THE NEGATIVE SIDE RIGHT NO POSITIVE SIDE
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING THE D CELLS
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT US I CHAN BULB ON THE OTHER
Line_751	THE LIGHT BALLS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEM SELVES THAT'S ARADY BEEN USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND THAT'S THE WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS THAT ARE T HELP USE SOME THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL A VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING UM
Line_754	YEAH HUH GOOD
Line_755	THEY THEY'RE NORMALLY USED THE CRISMIUS TO DECORATE TO S TREES AND HOUSES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRING S BURN OUT DEPENDING ON WHAT IT'S
Line_758	A PARAL- A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF A BULB GOES OUT THE WHOLE LIGHT GOES THE WHOLE THING GOES OUT IN YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULB WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL IT BOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEEDS
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE RULER BULBS SAY AND NOT ONES STEALING WEN THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHERS BURN
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEY'RE GOING IN A LINE AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE RESTON'T STAY LIT
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILLED THE FILL IN THE BULB WITH THE FILLED BROKEN
Line_769	FILAMENT IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT'S FINE
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RIDING BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR OTHER THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	HE THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YARN A COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL SCAR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK IS A REMOVE
Line_777	AND STEEL ON LIKE IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE W
Line_778	IT IS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCK HAS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOODBLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULLS IT SO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TIN AND THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_783	IT WILL STICK CAUSE IT HAS TRACES OF IRON
Line_784	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK DIDN'T I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE BLACK RO
Line_785	IT WELL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON FOR STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIPS
Line_786	ONS IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST REENFORCED
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WELL E OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD SAPTRACTING AND THEY WOULD REP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE IT IS THE OTHER MAGNET JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OPPOSITE ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES REPEL
Line_791	DOING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE'S USING A COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE'S GOING BUT RIGHT NOW SHE'S GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE EARTH NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT SEES THE MAGNETS IN WOULD HAPPENS WHEN THEY INTRACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS A TRYING ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECTS
Line_797	MAGNETISM ONLY HAS A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BEYOND THE RANGE THE THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TWO IT'S TOO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE TICKS STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM BUT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	IS IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNET GOES THROUGH THE SCREW IN IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY'RE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONE
Line_802	IT'S IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHEN IT COMES OFF THEN NAIL STOPS BEING THE MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU YOU WHEN YOU TAKE THE THE MAGNET PROFPHIT STOPS IN A MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISMS
Line_807	TAKES THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	E A MAGNETISM
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SO STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THROUGH SUCH THICK STACK S
Line_814	SEEING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
Line_815	A BAG DITCH
Line_816	THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISM BRAKES BECAUSE IT'S TOO STRONG OF A WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY HID ANOTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THE MAGNETISM WAS WEAKER THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SPACER S
Line_819	IT MUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIKE THE
Line_820	THE BARFLATES SEALED MAGNET TOOL
Line_821	I A NORTH IS UM
Line_822	WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER WET
Line_823	BOLTS
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	INCREASES IT'
Line_826	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC POLE WEAR
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT STOPS CREATING ELECTRIELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM UH DISAPPEARS
Line_831	HERE'S A D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH A RIVET A WIRES AND THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT WORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVETS
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE THE- THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE METAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGNETISM GETS
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE POWERING A MOTOR IS ONLY IT HAS TO REACH FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND CIRCLES TILL IT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRE S
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH AS CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW IT CAN'T BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED AND MAGNIFIED
Line_840	A SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT M-MAGNETED UP TO THIS THE RIVET
Line_842	AD ELECTROMAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURN IT ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AND STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THEN IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO THE MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	I MEAN
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND IT GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINGING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SALT SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALLY THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM OF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	ITS STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED SORT
Line_864	THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SOL
Line_865	THE SUN SETS A SIGHT
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TOO MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY T AND SO ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	TH ENERGY WON'T THROUGH FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR WIPE SO CUING
Line_875	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE B
Line_877	S IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHTER
Line_880	THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING BECAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKES
Line_881	T THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKES UM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM
Line_883	THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS A DELICIOUS
Line_884	THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR STEAM
Line_885	IT GETS FOWLGY OR SMOKY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I'VE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES KNOW
Line_888	ITS IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_889	I'M NOT SURE I COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	S SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_894	M SORRY UM THERE'S ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_895	IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	IT'S FLOWING BALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AMIGOS DO NOT GET THE CON
Line_900	UM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK IN
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS OILY ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THE IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE BASE AND THE CASING THEN IT'S THEIR OKAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT CA
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARN THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IF
Line_905	THE STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE OF MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY REAR THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK CAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	DES IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES WHY ELSE WOULD IT STICKS
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S A METAL HOLE
Line_915	METAL
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SCIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCES AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE A TON
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THES IT'S NORTH THE SOUTH OR SOUTH THE NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXCEPT FOR THE BO THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLDS
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPASS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS PICKING A IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHER
Line_930	ITS IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY SPIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY THICK THEN IT CAN'T
Line_932	THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	ENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ONTO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	UM THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THE MA
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	ITS TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNET S NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LOST WELL THE NAIL IS ON THERE WELL MEAN WELL THE MAGNETS ON A
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFERING INTO THE A NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT'S A
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION IT'S TOO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WHAT WE DID WE STUCK A A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROKE THE MAGNETIC
Line_947	THERE ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SIX PACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER CLICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER AND THERE'S MORE SPACE IN BETWEEN AND IT JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEAKER
Line_952	M YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER THE FORCE AND BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU BIN FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT THE
Line_956	I SEE CANDLE I THINK IT'S A FIRE
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SHE RE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_958	UM IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	THE FIRE BURNING IS PROOF THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRIDGE S I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUT OF METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_964	REFRIGERATOR DOES THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON I POSSIBLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS STEEL NAIL AS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THEY'RE BOTH MADE AT ON STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WEIGHT ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	I THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PREY HA PA HAS LIKE METAL ON THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INSIDE
Line_971	THE IRON AND OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	A IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNIE
Line_974	I'VE BEEN LEARNING AH HOW UM CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THE A WIRE A BATTERY LIGHT
Line_976	WIRES BATTERY AND A
Line_977	THE WIRES THEY THEY BREAKS UP ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FROM ANOTHER UM
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WIRES UM UM ARE ALL
Line_980	IT PROVIDES UHM HOW THE UM
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKES A UM
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WATER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_983	IT WILL SHUT OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL UM UM B
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CAN THE ELECTRICITY SO UM THE LIGHT BULB CAN LI
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP TWO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY UM ELECTRICITIES UH THE BATTERIES CA THE LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECE- THE A LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE E FROM THE
Line_988	IT'S FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE N
Line_989	THE POINT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIGNS
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRIC IT
Line_991	IT SLIPPED OVER IT SOR
Line_992	S SO IF YOU FLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BAT
Line_994	THAT YOU AFTER HAVE UM ONE OF THE WIRES UM CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE B
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULB LIGHTS
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BLACK BY UM THE D CELL
Line_997	UH THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BOTH TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY DAYS TO BREATH THE BATTERY BRINGS ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTIVE FROM THE WAI
Line_999	CAN YOU REPEAT I
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN A PICTURE IS SO LIKE IT DON'T SIT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTOR IS UM SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CL- OPEN
Line_1003	I NOTICED THAT UM THE UH THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM IT SPENDS AND UM
Line_1004	U CALOURPDAI
Line_1005	UH IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE MOTOR YET BUT WHEN COMPOSER IT WILL
Line_1006	IT IT DOES NOT MOVE UH IT DOESN'T MAKE UH ELECTRICITY UM FLOW TO THE MOTOR UM I CORE
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLAR POWER IS COLLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WATERS TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD
Line_1009	WON'T BRING ELECTRICITY AND TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIN
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPINS THE
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO UM COMPLETE UM M COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	OOD I NOTICED THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT TOUCHING A METAL P
Line_1013	LITTLE MEAN
Line_1014	H
Line_1015	I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT A
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER POINTS THAT WELL MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	OKAY BYE MONEY OOH IS THAT YOUR NAME
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	PUT WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME ABOUT HOW I'M FEELING
Line_1020	UHM YOU WOULD JUST MEAN I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES DO COAL AND LIGHT BULB OW
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW UM THE LIGHT BULB COULD LIGHT UP AND UM PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHRRGERY LIKE TRICKS AND HAVE A
Line_1026	I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE UHM FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	SLIGHT ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DIDN'T N LIKE ANYTHING YOU JUST WAIT
Line_1029	I COULD SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAH Y
Line_1030	UH TEN YOU REPEAT THAT AGA
Line_1031	WE UM ACTUALLY DOING PARTY GOO
Line_1032	UH WE'VE BEEN DOING UM HOW
Line_1033	US IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE SO ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_1036	UH CAN YOU EAT THE PLEASE
Line_1037	THERE IS WE UM CAME
Line_1038	THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU HAVE MORE D CELLS THEN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AT THE TIME YOU ADD MORE D CELLS
Line_1040	UM A ONE BATTERY ONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB A SA COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU UM HAVE A POTEGE SIDE AND AN NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECT TOGETHER
Line_1043	YE I'VE A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUIT'S
Line_1045	L LIGHT BULB WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NOW
Line_1047	AT
Line_1048	IT'S IT'S JUST THE USE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY UM WON'T WELL ONE
Line_1050	THEY SERVE YOU LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NOW LIGHT
Line_1051	E ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINUS SIGN E
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWS IN THE UM PLUS SIGN AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS ER
Line_1055	MOLECULES OR ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE MIDDLE BULBS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKAY THAT'S AN FINE
Line_1057	THE MINUS SIGN E
Line_1058	DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MARNEY
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T START IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	EITHER WAY YOU CLICK ONE WIRE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OR THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNIE SEE YOU NEXT
Line_1062	I WAS BUILDING A CIRCUIT A STEEL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND IN TO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND THAT IT IS ON AND THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY BUT
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NOW RUNNING
Line_1067	T THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT NEXT TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE A MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT'S THE METAL AND IT IT'S LIKE ELECTRICFYING TOO THE WIRES
Line_1071	SIT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I WHEN I CLICKED IT IT MOVE AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE THE FLAG STOPS FLOWING IT'S AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEXGONS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE ELECTRIC
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PANEL AND THE A AND THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SEPRVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WON'T SERVE AND ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S OWN
Line_1080	IT JUST GETS OFF IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T L
Line_1083	NOTHING'S HAPPENING
Line_1084	YOUR TWO MARNEY STEER LATER HAVE A GOOD DIG TWO BYE
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACED
Line_1087	ELECTRONS A METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD WORK
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING AH JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH AND THE WIRES
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTIC K IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD RIGHT THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT A METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANY THING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THE CONDUCTORS ARE A THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS CA
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICKED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTOR STARTED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND THE SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE THE HEAT ENERGY IT'S MOVING AROUND AND A MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGHT AND IT TO BRIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE A STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND A HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	SLIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	Y YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRED
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE THE PLASTIC AND IT'S SOUNDED
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WA SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_1111	APPLES
Line_1112	THE FIELDS SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE'LL BE SWEAT IRRENGE AND THE CAR
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE HOT AND SMOKE COMES FLY AR
Line_1115	THE SOLAR PANELS
Line_1116	GAS WOOD WINDMILLS SOLAR PANELS
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BOTH ARE A ENERGY
Line_1118	YOU BOTH HAVE ENERGY IN UM AND THEY BOTH ERVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THE BULB ARE KEE
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T ER ENERGY THEY JUST IT ABOUT SMOKE AND THE GAS MAKES THE CARBON L
Line_1121	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLAR PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GAS DOESN'T
Line_1123	THEY SERVE AS MELT AND MAIL IN THREE TH
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE FLAG UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IT LIGHTING UP
Line_1127	THEY'RE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILAMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	E ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY F FLOW ANYWHERE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT'LL WORK LIKE SWITCH IN THE CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	OH IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET A DARKER
Line_1134	THEY BULL THEY ONE GETS BRIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN I CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLIPPED IT AGAIN THEN STOPPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BOY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	UH I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT ON STUFF UH MAGNETS
Line_1140	M I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONCURNING ENERGY
Line_1143	UH MOON'T BEEN
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE FILAMENT
Line_1145	UM I DO WELL NOW
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHTBULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEEN ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE BATTERIES MID THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON BESIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE F FOR WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	W WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT OH AN IAN COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRES
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
Line_1160	STINGS OF LIGHTS ARE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1161	IT'S KINDA LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE BOUT THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO LINE
Line_1163	WIRES AND A BATTERY AND A A
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEGAL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DOING
Line_1166	THE FILAMENT DRIED
Line_1167	THEY FILLMENT DIED ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILMING LIVES IN THE WEIGHT IN THE WEIGHT
Line_1169	A FILMMAND DING ON A BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDECANT CIRCUITS AND I CAN REMEMBER THE LESS
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILLMANT ISN'T DYING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILM BRAKES AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS M
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINUS SIGN AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AN IN COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	IT THE FILAMENT IS DYING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS UP WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT'S ST
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IN THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CONDESENT CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1180	I'VE BEEN DOING UM WELL I LAUGHED MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH NORTH SO THEY'RE GOING NOT TO BE OPPOSITE SO THIS CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	WE GO STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	ONE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WOOD ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S ST
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL M EST
Line_1187	BECAUSE BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD S NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER A STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAILS AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SOM
Line_1193	ANY THING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL F IT WILL FIT IN AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS A LOT OF TOOLS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TENS
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	TEN STALINAR
Line_1198	THESE ARE MAGNETS THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNETS THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKES A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEEDS TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON LEA LA MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT ALL STOPS AND IT DOES FALL AND IT DOLL FULL
Line_1205	NON MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BUILD UP TALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED TO HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES E I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	I NEED WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETS THREE WIRES AND A BAT
Line_1209	THERE'S THINGS I W
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S NOT ON IT'S GONNA
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVETS STOPPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPPED AND THE MAGNETS W
Line_1212	UM METETONE THERE
Line_1213	OPEN I MEAN CLOSED
Line_1214	THE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORGE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNET BY THE RIVET
Line_1215	ELECTRICITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	REVE AND -IRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BATTERY AND TH MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB UH
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS THE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE TURN
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHO IS HOOKED TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GOES THROUGH
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1226	IT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE WHAT'S RECEIVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL TOWARDS THE NE THE POSIT THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCU
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF TH
Line_1231	I I WAS ABSENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PARIELS AND HUGER AND SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING BRICK HEAT AND STUFF
Line_1234	CONDUCTOR IS MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICE THAT ALL THE PENCILS ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	IN INSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTIC AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS A CONDUCTOR
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRIC
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND ELECT ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORK AND WITHOUT ENERGY IT NO THING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THEY LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS
Line_1242	YEAH YOU HEAR A LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGH
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TYPES OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BIRTED
Line_1245	EN IT THE HANDS PA ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EATS HE'S GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOOD SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALK
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEAR NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRL IS EATING AND SCARING HER ENERGY SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE A VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PULLS THE AIR THE AIR GETS ALL DIRTY AND NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO BREATHE IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKEY
Line_1252	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STORING
Line_1253	THE DASOLING AND THE COAL ARE SUMMARY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND A GLASS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THE
Line_1255	COAL AN GAS WOULD HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON THE IRON BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BRIN
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	TH ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FOR THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVEMENT ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE L
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1262	THE BUDS MOVING REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE IS ONE PATH OR OTHERS THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIES
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH A
Line_1265	BYE MARNEY
Line_1266	VERY WELL HOW ABOUT
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICED THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE TH
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE'S TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOWE GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
Line_1274	THE END OF THE BATTERY WHERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES JUST CONNECTED TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE CIRCUIT OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB AND GOES INTO THE POSIT
Line_1276	I NOTICED THAT THE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB IN SO THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS USING IT
Line_1277	I UM UH HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A WIRES AND AN THE BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY LIGHT THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE W
Line_1280	SOURCE IS THE SAME DIG
Line_1281	WELL IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1282	E TIE
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WEIGHT DES
Line_1284	W WELL THEY LIGHT UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THERE'S WIG THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT UP AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF LAKE GOING DOWN THE
Line_1286	CANDY A LINE AGAIN
Line_1287	IT IS GOING TO A LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING LIKE THE SAME
Line_1289	THEY S SMOKE TO FILL
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST WHITE AND THEN IT TURNS YELLOW SO IT TURNS
Line_1291	AL WE GET SEE MIXED U
Line_1292	WE HAVE BEEN UH DOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GO
Line_1293	WELL THE GREY SAKE IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1294	IT IS D BECAUSE MOTOR THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT RUNS LIKE AROUND NEAR
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DON'T W
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE ITS ENERGY FROM THE BAT
Line_1300	THE- THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1301	THE FLAG STARTS MOVING AROUND LIT AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN IT'LL START THE FLAG WILL START
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH HITS WIRE THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DID T YET
Line_1306	THE GREAT PEACE WITH IT SUNK
Line_1307	WE'LL COME A CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU FLIP THE SUN
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MO
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS WALKING THE FLAG UP
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UH
Line_1312	I SEE THE FLAG MOVING
Line_1313	THE THE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING A WIRE SO THAT'S MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THE UM WIRES IN THE SWIT-
Line_1316	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSE S
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE OF THE STICKY
Line_1319	IT IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT A MOVING
Line_1320	UHM I DON'T A KNOW BECAUSE I ARE LEARNING Y
Line_1321	O AS SO THE S THE LAST STICK
Line_1322	THE STEEL MELT THE STEEL THE
Line_1323	YOU TOO BY MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUITS
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE UM MAIL AND IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE AND THE FLAG IS LUMINED BY THE THE
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND ROUND IN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH IN THE WIRES
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT IT'S S NOT METAL
Line_1329	IT STOPS UHM IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UM
Line_1331	YOU MAGNET OLD MATTER
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANDLE AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STICK THE PLA IT'S GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MELT TO CAN
Line_1334	BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE
Line_1335	IT MELTS CAN HAVE A FIRE THE IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT UH WE CAN SO THAT IT'S ITERY
Line_1337	NO I COULD NOT SEEN THAT THING
Line_1338	IT WAS A SOUND AND IT GAVE IT WOOD FIRE
Line_1339	IT IS TAKE WITH THE ENERGY OF WA UH
Line_1340	IT MAKES POUNDS SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	H
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GAS BOTTLE APPLES AND A FIRE
Line_1343	METAL WIRES APPLE WOOD BLACK STUFF A
Line_1344	IT GOES IN IT ON
Line_1345	THE SOLAR US TRY AND T
Line_1346	HI YEAH
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT IS
Line_1348	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETS
Line_1349	THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STRAIGHT ONE IS CURVED AND THEN ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	THEY IT'S CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IT
Line_1351	A IT STICKS TO A REFLIRREFRIGITOR
Line_1352	WELL IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRICIIERATOR HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE IMMATIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNIC AND SO THE FRIGERATOR IS BAD
Line_1354	WELL THE THIS THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE S
Line_1355	THEY USE TO BECAUSE THAT THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MA THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE THE SCREW
Line_1357	WELL A TRACCALITY DOES BUT A GAS DOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON INS
Line_1359	I DON'T UM
Line_1360	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON IN
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IT'
Line_1364	BECAUSE WHAT HAS IRON AND WHAT DOESN'T
Line_1365	H
Line_1366	IT WILL NOT
Line_1367	ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BAT
Line_1369	S BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT
Line_1370	EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WAIST THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL AND THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO IT'S NORMAL SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICED THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSH
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EACH SEND
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW A COMPLETE CIRCUITS
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED H
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIPS ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK IT NEEDS METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR A TYPE OF SOURCES TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF TRICITY FOR A PIECE OF NA
Line_1381	THE SIDE IT AND THEN YOU WON'T
Line_1382	INSULATORS ARE ARE HEALTHFUL
Line_1383	IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ER
Line_1384	SON
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS S
Line_1386	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT IT'S A MELTING
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND DROPPED I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
Line_1390	IT'S HEATING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING US
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUT YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOCICED UM THE SOUNDS AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HERS FEET
Line_1393	UM SHE IS GETTING THE ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS E
Line_1394	THE IN APPLES AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PAN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ON WORK BECAUSE GLASS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	I FROM BECAUSE UM THE COOL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE GAS HASN'T I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MELT THE EARTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREE AND EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT RERULLE
Line_1400	IT IS A COMPLETE DEFORMED FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
Line_1401	WELL UHM I THINK THAT THE LIKE THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND THEY THAT'S WHAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB WIDER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FLOOR THERE IS FOUR PATHWAYS TO A SERIOUS CIRCUIT
Line_1403	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO TWO UH D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORT OF ENERGY SO IT WO WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK YOUR WORK MAYBE I
Line_1405	I MEAN TRY UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS THE WORDEN STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE DON'T LIKE THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES A A A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T THERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR AND THE THE WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UH IT COME
Line_1413	THAT AT THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE
Line_1414	HILL THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE I'VE SEEN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1416	THEY BE JUST SWITCHING FOR A D ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT'S THE BATTERY
Line_1418	GOOD BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHILE YOU WERE TALKING AND I
Line_1419	HELP STARTED TO WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	WOULD A TRICK A LIGHT IS PARTLY
Line_1421	WIRES HOLD ALIKE ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1422	IT WON'T WORK EDYBORB BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE THE ENERGY HOLDS BAD
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANY BOARD BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALREADY TRIED OUT AND STUFF
Line_1424	I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT'S JUST SAY IT WERE
Line_1426	UH BAR AND CAN I PLEASE JESTFITTICU
Line_1427	IGHBUB ROLE AND IT
Line_1428	IT WON'T BROKE SO IT DOESN'T WORK SO THEY HAS TO CHANGE IT FOR A
Line_1429	WE'VE SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ALL
Line_1430	WON'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STAND IT'S DOESN'T WORK
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THAT ELECTRICITY'S GOING TO ALL THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UM IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE
Line_1433	THROAT IT DOESN'T LIGHT AND WORK
Line_1434	WELL UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERIES
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A COUPLE OF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING AT BE
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKES ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO LEARN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GOE THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP THE POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING THRO-
Line_1440	A POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASHLIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEIVES POWER AS FROM THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND NEVER M
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO B
Line_1445	WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN AND DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S I DIDN'T INVENT ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UHM I CAN SEE THE PICTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	THE THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOT
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING IS POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIR
Line_1453	M AND SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WATERS ONTO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES SO
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	UM THE THE PERSON WHO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW IT'S WORK
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER OR POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN FOR IT
Line_1460	METAL HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
Line_1461	THING WHENEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
Line_1462	ITCH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHT WAY
Line_1463	UM WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT THEM YET BECAUSE THE PA THE WE GOT THE LAID BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK OR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS
Line_1466	YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE CUPS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_1467	SWITCH ON ME A MINE A MALL
Line_1468	D CELL THEALONIUM AL SWITCH THAT METAL AN M MOTOR
Line_1469	T SWITCH THE METAL OF THE D
Line_1470	IT'S TOUCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METAL WA IT'S MAKING
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	UH THERE'S NOTHIN REALLY ELSE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST W
Line_1473	M IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOW
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS A LOT BETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF THE
Line_1477	THE FLAME GLARES OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE B
Line_1478	ITS BURNS IN THE WAX IT IT MELTS
Line_1479	UH IT'S SOUNDED CAN BE LIKE POPPING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOME MOVES HITTING THE BONGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENERGY
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRYING HAND THAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DISK A FAN TREE BRANCHES RAISINS AND FUEL
Line_1483	IT GIVES UP MORE AIR BECAUSE IT LEFT THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE C THE FIRE C UM POLLICH AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT AFFECTS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S ON AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HI YE
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE COULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR THESE LIKE A FAN AN A MOTO
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH OURSELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1493	OR THE FRONT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINUS
Line_1494	THOSE ARE THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND THEN
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF IT GETS STUCK TO
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTER
Line_1497	IT WILL GET REALLY LIGHT AND W
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAYBE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNS BATTERIES OR REALLY QUITE
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN A CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHERS
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE ON BOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRIGH
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWISTED TO EACH THING
Line_1504	T THERE IS MANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERIE- SERIES CIRCUITS HAVE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE MO IT'S NOT A COMPLETE SIRI
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT LIGHTS THE BULB AND I THINK THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE C
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILM BRAKES IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND ON
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKS
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB'S STOPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT IN DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STAYS ON
Line_1513	THE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1514	THAT THING HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1515	BECAUSE IT'S JUST DOING ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CIRCUITS SO IT CAN FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
Line_1516	TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER LIGHT YOU'RE TRYING TO POWER YUP
Line_1517	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL GOING UH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER IT UP AND BACK THROUGH THE REAR ENDS OF THE D
Line_1518	FOR ENERGYES TO GO DIRECTLY TO LIGHT BULB AND MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1519	THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE BATTERY BACK TO THE NEGATIVE SO
Line_1520	THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS IN THE CENTER LEAVES AND INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER BOTH OF THE LIGHT
Line_1522	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE UM LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BE THAT THAT D
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT
Line_1528	THAT THE D CELL'S DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY
Line_1529	BE
Line_1530	THEY'RE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ENDS EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT'S SHAPED LIKE A DO
Line_1531	WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH GOES ON TO EACH OTHER THEY CONNECT BUT IF NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH TRYING TO CONNECT IT WON'T WORK
Line_1532	UM IT'S ALL ONE BIG SLIDE
Line_1533	THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THEY'RE ALL ON ON THE END
Line_1534	A STEEL A STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DONUT BRAIN MAGN
Line_1535	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MAGNETIC
Line_1536	WOOD YARN AND CARS
Line_1537	THE ONES THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET YOU STICK TO IT THE ONES THAT DON'T IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT STICK TO TO IT IT'LL U
Line_1538	THE WEIGHT NAIL ISN'T MAGNETIC MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT'S NOT STICKING TO IT
Line_1539	THE ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A MAGNET THAT ISN'T A MAGNETIC FORCES THAT WILL STICK TO A MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
Line_1540	IT HAS TO BE EITHER METAL OR IRON
Line_1541	S MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED IN STEEL
Line_1542	I THINK THEY HAD SOME KIND OF OR IN IT
Line_1543	OR AND IRON
Line_1544	THAT THERE IS ONLY TEN
Line_1545	THAT THEY ARE BOTH LIGHTING
Line_1546	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE ONES ON THE ONE ON THE
Line_1547	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIGHT MORE OR WHATEVER YOUR TRYING TO I DON'T
Line_1548	THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE IT UM WOULD LIGHT
Line_1549	THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS TO POWERS THEM UP AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D
Line_1550	THAT THEY ARE- POWERING UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1551	THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_1552	WELL IT TO
Line_1553	THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB IS KEEPS BURNING DOWN
Line_1554	THAT THERE ARE UH MORE THAN ONE D CELL
Line_1555	THAT THEY ARE A MORE BRIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_1556	THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THEY'RE ARE JUST
Line_1557	THAT THE BATTERY IS A NOT LIGHTING AND
Line_1558	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE CIRCUIT
Line_1559	THAT SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY O ONE PATHWAY
Line_1560	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONCE
Line_1561	THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1562	THAT THE BULBS ARE BURNING TOT
Line_1563	THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1564	THAT THE FILL MADE IS BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_1565	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1566	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1567	THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINUE
Line_1568	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1569	THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THEN IT WILL BURN OUT QUICKLY
Line_1570	THAT WHEN ONE FILM BREAKS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL STILL CONTINUE
Line_1571	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY UH
Line_1572	THAT THE FILM IM BRACE IN THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
Line_1573	SIR IT N WAKES IT IT WEIGHS A WEIGHT BUL
Line_1574	AT THE UM FILAMENT BREAK
Line_1575	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
Line_1576	E ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
Line_1577	THAT'S ARE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH POLE IN SOUTH
Line_1578	THAT THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE IN THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE OLD BREAKS THEM APART
Line_1579	THAT THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FOUR SPRINGS THEM TOGETHER
Line_1580	THAT BUT MAG THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
Line_1581	BECAUSE IT IS METAL AND IT'S STICKING TO A MAGNET INSIDE OF A MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THE NA
Line_1582	THAT- IT IS METAL
Line_1583	WOOD GRASS DURIT
Line_1584	THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NAIL WOOD S STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1585	I DON'T MEAN
Line_1586	BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT THE MAGNETS STICKING TO T STEEL BUT THE PAPER OTHERS WILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE STEEL OR ONES STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I I DID
Line_1591	THAT IT STICKED
Line_1592	S STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1593	THAT IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER IT CANNOT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1594	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1595	S STEEL OR METAL I
Line_1596	THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT IT CAN STICK AND NOT STICK ONTO THEM AND THEN NORTH POLE IN SOUTH POLE
Line_1597	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1598	THEY HAVE OTHER SETTLE ON THEM WHICH UH MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT TO
Line_1599	THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL ON E
Line_1600	THAT THERE ARE MAGNETS AND WE CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1601	THAT'S THE MAGNET MAGNET A MAGNET I DON'T KNOW
Line_1602	THAT ONE STACK IS BIGGER THAN ANOTHER SO THE MAGNET CAN ONE TH OTHERS
Line_1603	I CAR A
Line_1604	THAT THE MAGNET CAN NOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNETS SO THAT STICKS OF PAPER
Line_1605	THAT'S S MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE UM MAGNET
Line_1606	DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE IT IT WILL JUST BE A A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THEN TEL THE MAGNET GETS TAKEN OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GETS TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS ON
Line_1611	WASHER'S I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	THAT WHEN IT GAS STOOD NINETEEN WASHERS AND BACKED IT TO UM BRAKE
Line_1613	THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	THE SPACERS WE'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	A THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO SAY THAT
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FORCES BRINGING THEM TOGETHER I
Line_1619	IT TOOK NINE SPACERS TO WRING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO TRAP IT AROUND THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1622	THAT THE WIRES RAN WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE IT LIKE WELL STICK TO THE RIB
Line_1623	S SO IT PRODUCES ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRIES ELECT MAGNETISM FORCE UH SO IT COULD CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METALS STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTROMAGNETS CAN CARRY METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THAT'S THE ELECTRIC ELECTROMAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IT IS NOT AN ELECTRO MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IS THE ELECTROMAGNET CAN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_1631	ITS SO IT'S PICKS UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1633	THE A SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	AS BE WRAPPED AROUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIKE ALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELP UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TOOL TO USE
Line_1639	I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE IT'S A A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1640	M I THINK WHAT TRAVELS IN WIRES IS ENERGY TO TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROOM OR E ANYTHING THAT NEEDS LIGHT IN DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGHS CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I COULD THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU HAVEN'T
Line_1645	IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLUS
Line_1646	I THINK THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINUS SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONENTS COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BY MARNEY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE A GREAT HELP
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO THROW FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES
Line_1652	E ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MIX THE MOTORS
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE A
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING B
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	UN IS GIVING THE SHELL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SP
Line_1660	THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WASTE ENERGY AND WELL IT DOESN'T WASH
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE CIRCU
Line_1664	THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG S
Line_1665	YOU WO MARNEY THANK YOU BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS SPIN AROUND AND
Line_1667	YOU GET USE DIFFERENT STUFFS TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS TAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAIL
Line_1670	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL THAT WORKS
Line_1674	WE'VE BEEN I USING OPEN MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1677	CROSSED MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE ANYTHING METAL ACCURATE CAN CREATE WORKS OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
Line_1679	I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNI I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIN
Line_1681	GOOD GOOD I
Line_1682	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1683	OU HAVE THE DO WE FOR I'M THROUGH OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE DON'T TOO
Line_1684	A SOLUET A CIRCUITS
Line_1685	I FORGOT IT
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY AND THAT LIKE LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND IN ME INTO EVERYTHING IT
Line_1688	IT'S FALLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WENT
Line_1689	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY BABY
Line_1690	THEY CONNECT ME THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THE LITER REMIND ME OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	SUCK UP THE FRESH IS THAT IT GOES OUT TO D CALL IT GOES A A LIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THAT'S METAL IN THE L
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AT NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY AND THE LIGHT WE LIGHT FOR
Line_1695	U MULTA BULBS UM MEANS LESS LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY LIKE TAKE ARE AND IT ISN'T NOT A VERY GOOD
Line_1697	I THINK THAT EIGHT BULBS WOULD LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WITH ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT THE ONE WE DO THE SAYS IS VERY VERY BRIGH
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT WE
Line_1700	I I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT'S OVER I GUESS
Line_1702	AOSDACIOS I UH WE MISSED M
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO A MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT ITS NOT ACTUALLY NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRES MEAN SPREAD YOU'RE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	I DREAM DON'T KNOW
Line_1707	I THINK THAT THE B I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB WILL DIM
Line_1708	I NOTICE WHEAT THERE IS ROLLING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE E FOR PATHWAYS MAYBE
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK UM IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	I REMEMBER THAT IT GOES OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1713	UM I THINK IT IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SE
Line_1714	I NOTICED THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1716	UM I DON'T KNOW I ALL
Line_1717	I NOTICED THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS MORE WIRES
Line_1718	I I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	U I STREAK THE THE TOP WORK WORK
Line_1721	I THINK THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S THEIR A BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I HAVE LEARNING ABOUT M
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT ON THE MITURSING SO THE LEORIVE IS NOT IT
Line_1726	BECAUSE THE WITCH IS NOT PROTECTED TO PERMITS
Line_1727	UM I THINK THAT THEN THE BULB WOULD LIKE THE LIGHT YOU R
Line_1728	IT THE LIMBLE UHM YOU UH
Line_1729	UM THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UM DOESN'T LIGHT LIKE AND S FOR CLUTCH
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THE THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIKE THING OF QUART
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULB MAYBE
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILM BRAKES THE BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT IT IS BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS LIGHTING BECAUSE THE ONE IS BROKE
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT BECAUSE THE FILM BROKE SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGH
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOPS
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BULB BREAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1737	M A PARALLEL MA
Line_1738	M WHENEVER ONE BRAKES THE OTHER IT'S LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S OWN WIRES
Line_1739	I NOTICED THAT WHATEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILL M IT BREAKES BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB UM ONE THE ENERGY COMPLELET LIE STOPS
Line_1741	UM I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER ONE STILL
Line_1742	THIS PICTURE HAS TO DO WITH A BULB BURNING OUT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES SENSE
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE ARE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TO THE LIGHT BULB WILL B
Line_1744	I THINK THE FOLB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T M
Line_1745	WHENEVER ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BREAKS OUT
Line_1746	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER UH ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	T WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURINS OUT UM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM MY BULB WILL NOT BRIGHT
Line_1751	WHENEVER THE FILL IM BRAKES THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	M I THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN IT OWN WIRE
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDER OH UM WHENEVER ONE FILLMENT BRAKES THE OTHER ONE STILL WIGHTS
Line_1756	ECTRICITY STUFFS THE ENERGY STUFFS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT REALLY AS LOST WHEN I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILLIMENT IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING G
Line_1760	I THINK THE ELECT ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	UM I KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	M I KNOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THEN THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB DOESN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	I THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	WHENEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANYTHING WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I I THINK THAT THE FRIDGE IS EITHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IT ORDER FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY OTHER MADE A A STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TIPS OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	S STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS EITHER FUEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE EITHER MADE OUT OF STEEL IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE EITHER STEEL OR A IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	S STEEL OR IRON
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERY THING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERY WIRE AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MAKE THE FOOD
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THEM LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILL LIGHT UP THE B
Line_1787	THAT IN REVIVES E
Line_1788	IT IS A LIGHTING UP THE
Line_1789	YORES
Line_1790	IT FLOWERS BY IT HAS LOT'S OF ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE BOB TO MAKE IT LUSH ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE L
Line_1794	IT'S MOVING TO THE MINE'S SWAY IN
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINUS S
Line_1797	IT'S GIVING LID OF ENERGY
Line_1798	U TO SEE
Line_1799	IT DOESN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	I HAVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING A POWER
Line_1802	ITS
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN IT TURN ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER TO
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SISTOM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOMP
Line_1808	IT'S GOING AROUND THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR MA
Line_1809	LEARNING TOT
Line_1810	THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1811	AND SHRINKING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE ONE IS GOING THROUGH THE INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT SO
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SPUNGE ON IT IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1814	D CELL WIRESMOTORS
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY AND
Line_1816	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T STICK
Line_1817	IT'S NOT A METAL SO IT WILL GIVE ENERGY
Line_1818	THE A INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1819	THE SPONGE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT DOES NOT KNOW
Line_1820	THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAUSE SOME ARE METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S METAL SO ME THAT
Line_1822	IT LED YEAH WHEN YOU PUT METAL ON TO IT MOTOR WITH SOLAR
Line_1823	IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1824	IT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WILL SINK
Line_1825	THE THAT THE SPINS COULD IT METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE CLOSED THEY ARE MAKING METERS STAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MIDDLE
Line_1827	HI
Line_1828	YOU LIGHT A CANDLE U FROM
Line_1829	BE BECAUSE IT GIVES YE
Line_1830	IT'S A CANDLE AND IT'S WE LIKE SCIENCE BECAUSE
Line_1831	IT'S ELING
Line_1832	BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY
Line_1833	HUH
Line_1834	AA THE WIND
Line_1835	LEMS
Line_1836	SHE IS EVEN CALTICU
Line_1837	IT'S GIVING POUND RAIN
Line_1838	IT'S DOING IN AN
Line_1839	THE A GIRL IS GIVING ENERGY IN HER BODY
Line_1840	I EAT
Line_1841	HER SHADE VE
Line_1842	I SEE A CANDLE SOME A
Line_1843	APPOLED
Line_1844	IT WILL GIVE BURNT
Line_1845	IT GETS IT GIVES A HEAT
Line_1846	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1847	DON'T GET IN HERE
Line_1848	UM YEAH
Line_1849	TS
Line_1850	BECAUSE GAS WILL LET THE COOL ENERGY
Line_1851	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT ONE HAS AN ENTRAINE ONE DOESN'T
Line_1852	UM I CAN NOT KNOW
Line_1853	YOU DO NOT KNOW
Line_1854	S EAT EMARGY
Line_1855	MANE I WAS A
Line_1856	LEARNING HOW TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AS MAGNET
Line_1857	TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE CELECTIVE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING IT PATHWAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY AND THERE SO IT COMES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1862	IT DOCKS
Line_1863	IT'S BECAUSE THE D CELL WAS THE ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THAT IF THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1865	THE ENERGY
Line_1866	M MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERGY
Line_1867	WHEN WHEN YOU ADD A THIRTY SALT IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
Line_1868	AND A D CELL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT LIGHTER SO IT GETS SO UH MORE ENERGY
Line_1869	ONE THEN ONE LIGHT BULB HAS A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED T TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY IT WILL WILL PASS IT WILL PASS THROUGH
Line_1872	THE D CELLS ARE STUCK TOGETHER
Line_1873	OOD
Line_1874	MAGNETISM'S
Line_1875	WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL
Line_1876	IT'S REPELLING
Line_1877	IT'S CAUSE THEY ARE A THE SAME
Line_1878	BECAUSE STRING THEY'RE THEY'RE DIFFERENT IN
Line_1879	MAKES MAGNETISM
Line_1880	THE A
Line_1881	WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNIC ATTRACTING IN P
Line_1882	IT'S IT'S GOIN
Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND TURN IT OFF THE LIGHT WON'T TURN
Line_1884	THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SWITCH IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT WRONG
Line_1885	IT WILL MAKE UH
Line_1886	IT IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE ITS BROKEN
Line_1887	YA IT'S WELL IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT IS BROKE IT WILL CIRCLE
Line_1889	IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT TEN ON TO LONG PROBABLY
Line_1890	ONE LIGHT RAN OFF RAIN OUT AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT
Line_1891	IT ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WE'LL STOP THE
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY FORCE
Line_1894	IT'S UM WHEN IT RAN OUT
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT LIGHT A CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL ST
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WILL STOP ON MOST
Line_1899	BECAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_1901	IT'S CAUSE IT S
Line_1902	CAUSE THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS RAN OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND REP
Line_1904	WHEN YOU D NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT WHEN YOU D SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL W
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	I WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FOR
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MAG
Line_1909	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS IRON AND SIDE IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACTS BECAUSE IT'S IRON AND SIDE OF IT IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON SIDE DON'T
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WIND HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
Line_1913	IT OR HAS IRON AND THE MAGNET'S IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT HAS
Line_1915	MAGNET STICKS TO IRON
Line_1916	IT'S BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOES HAVE I
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN'T
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON ON IT
Line_1919	THE NOW SAND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NOT METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACT S IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DOING
Line_1927	THAT IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE A CREATING CIRCUITS
Line_1929	IT WON'T OR THE D CELL IS IT IT AS THE AREA OF
Line_1930	BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE IT'S THE TEAMS ABOUT THAT THE ELECTRICITY AND IS LIKE CORE MAKE THE WORK
Line_1931	THAT ELECTRICITY'S IN THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY ARE
Line_1933	SO HAS TO BE ASKING TO NIFIRSE TO GO TH DRIVE ME TO THOSE MARRY ELECTRICITY TO BE HOWEVER
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GOING WELL BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S OR CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE PLATE NAME
Line_1935	UM METDOLN TECH HER RULE TO IRON SELLS AND THAT WAS FEEL JUST TO GET A FOIL
Line_1936	IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCU-
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH A D CELL AND IT WON'T IN THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH TO BE A
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE SUN IS SHAKING THE SAL THE IT IT WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THEN IT WILL WORK AND THE FLAG OR
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT I GET WHEAT WE WERE
Line_1942	IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE IT HAS TO B SUM AND HIGH HAS TO MAKE IT HE
Line_1943	THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE SHELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKES THE FLAG HOLD
Line_1944	THE FLAG MER
Line_1945	I DO SO ELECTRICITY MAKES A FLAT
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE LI AND IT DOESN'T HEAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEEN AND THE WATER
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A A CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL THE WAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG EVE
Line_1949	IT'S HAVE ELECTRICITY GOING UP TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING A FLAG TO
Line_1950	THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HULKED UP TO THE SWITCH
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OF THE THE METAL SO IT WILL MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	THE SWITCH PACKET TO ME OFF
Line_1953	IT DOESN'T WEIGH
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SUCKED UP TO TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN KNOWS IT HITS THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THEN THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1956	IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S CLOUDY DAY STOPS WORKIN
Line_1958	IT DOESN'T WAN
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	T MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT A ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING A CIRCUITS THAT WICKS THE MOTOR RUN AND MIX THE FLAG BLUE
Line_1963	L LECTRICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO IT TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUS
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB IN ORDER FOR IT LIGHT
Line_1967	THEY MAKES A ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	HAVE TO MAKE A PATH WHEN YOU CONNECT IT
Line_1969	IT LIGHTS THE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT IT GOES BACK
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTING TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT HAS HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK AND SO THE WA POSIT IS
Line_1974	NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPCIT WAY BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURENDORN IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPCIT WAY
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE THE TWO PACES OF THE BULB I DON WON'T WORE BECAUSE THE WIRES LICAL UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FINALLY WET BEFORE
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE ER SINCE YOU BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON
Line_1981	YOU TO PUT A NAIL IN THEIR IT'S LIKE WEIGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHERS BEFORE
Line_1983	YEAH GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE MET BEFORE BUT THAT I DON'T WANT TO MEAT YOU
Line_1984	T ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
Line_1985	THING THIS ONE UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO YOU IT NO
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1987	BE CAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKING IT WORK
Line_1988	METAL IT'S SOMETHING IF SOMETHING METAL THEN I IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING CAUSE IF THAT'S A NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE S STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE METAL AND MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKES ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO BUBBLE
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL IN THE MIDDLE THEY'RE ALL ON MITTLE THING
Line_1995	Y YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIP RIDER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART FORE
Line_1997	E SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIXED
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS IN YOUR E
Line_1999	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FOOD MATERIALS STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BULB BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP ON THE FIL
Line_2001	WATER IS FILTERING
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAYED IN THE COFFY FILTER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILT DURING
Line_2004	SAM THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALTS WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATED THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU WICK SOMETHING SOLUTION IS WHAT YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIFE JUST LIED AGAIN
Line_2010	SOCIAL PRODACTS
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THING DEPENDING ON THE AREA
Line_2013	THEY SAID THAT THOUGHT THERE WERE THERE IS THESE THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL
Line_2014	THERE IS HOMES GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN ITS
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	UM S GRAPPLE CLAY AND SILT
Line_2017	HOMES SCRAPPEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAINS AND FARM LANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARBONS
Line_2019	DELTA HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2020	THERE IS A LOT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL AND THAT THING BECAUSE IT HAS SILT CLAY HUMMES GRAVEL AND THAT'S STUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATTER YOULS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUM A SCRAFUL CLAIN SILT AND THIS SOIL
Line_2023	ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP IN
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A LOUD OF PLANT MIFE LIKE CACTI AND CACTI AND BUSHES AND OR TACK I
Line_2025	THE TE HAS A LOT MORE SAND THEN HE'S A
Line_2026	GOOD BYE YEAH
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLIP
Line_2028	THINKS IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT AS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S A PLAIN ONE OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT SOL DISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS IT'S WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEEN IT'S BULB TO PLANT AND THEN IT'S BEAN BIGGER
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_2035	UN
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	B CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLVING
Line_2039	I I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FORGOT THE W
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL THE N THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
Line_2043	IT'S IN SORTING CAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLID
Line_2044	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER DISAPPEAR
Line_2045	TIME LOTS OF LOTS OF TIMES
Line_2046	S SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A A SALT OVEN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER AT A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THAT THE WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE AUSTIN OR MIXTURE
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER IT WILL
Line_2053	WHAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTIONS
Line_2055	THE FLOWERS MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTIONS
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFY FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IT'S A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FI FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	Y YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BE BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THE SKY FORE
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPOR
Line_2065	CAN WE PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMBET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTIONS IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION
Line_2068	SPOONS ARE FLOWING
Line_2069	AM
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIGHER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEETER OR BETTER
Line_2072	THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARD SWEETER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEETER AND THEY LOOK A DENSER
Line_2074	THEY'RE DILUTED
Line_2075	L LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATERS OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD EITHER TAKE OUT FIFTY UM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT UH MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY HIKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	LA OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES A TOASTER AND ONES OBSERVED
Line_2083	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON A SAIL
Line_2084	ONE'S TEN TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASSES AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	UM SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION NONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION MINE AND SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENSITY HAS ITS UM THE CORK IS LIGHTER THAN THE PENY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKES SOMETHING FLO
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS S
Line_2096	BE CAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT COULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD FLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THE WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIX
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A IM FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED IN GOT BACK
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRA IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THAN THE RED AND THEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINKS OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BY THE BOAT BYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND D
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE A SHOOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ACID
Line_2109	BECAUSE UM IT'
Line_2110	I DON'T CARE IF
Line_2111	THE SAME ARE AND OUR SCIENCE NOTEBOOKS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE IT SAID
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SPIKY
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S BEAN
Line_2118	SO IT HAD AGAIN SO WE WHAT WE YEAH YEAH AMADUDAM MAD
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SAID THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NOW
Line_2122	WE'VE BEEN DOING E PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANT AND THEY REACT OFF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTES
Line_2126	NOT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	EACH TWO OF
Line_2128	THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM NOTHING STRONG WITH THE
Line_2130	ING SODA CALCIUM CLEAR AND H TOE
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT A PRECIPITATE
Line_2133	THE BECAUSE THEY'RE AREADY MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING JUST ICE GETTING PUTTING IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWATTING
Line_2135	THE WATER'S CHANGING COLORS
Line_2136	IT'S PRETTY YOU AND IT'S PINKY AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS UM BUBBLES AND
Line_2138	IT FIZZED AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE AH GREEN
Line_2140	THE GREY
Line_2141	E YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTED AND THEN THE SECOND ONE HAS NOT METAL
Line_2143	IF A A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIX OR IF IT TURNED A HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	CALCIUM COLORED WATER AND SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY EITHER A BLEW UP THE BAG AND FIZZED
Line_2147	THERE IS GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GAS LIQUID AND SOL
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCE IS WEARED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION ON SAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE HAS MORE SOLID
Line_2152	M OKAY WELL AND MADE HALLAIR
Line_2153	FROM ONE YEA
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SAL
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A HOPING AH SAL
Line_2157	WELL FIRST VALUE SHOOK IT UP SO AND IT'S ON MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO SETAL AND IT'S GONE TURNED DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT WAS MY FRIENDS SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SALT
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THEY
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNIFYING IT ON THE BOTTOM AND A SCREEN
Line_2164	THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES ARE ON A
Line_2165	NOTHING
Line_2166	THEY ALL HAVE PROPERTY OR SO IN THE BAG
Line_2167	WE'RE LOVE R AND IT WENT ALL UH COMMANDCAMANGA OR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTAINS OR THE FARMLAND OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	A BRIGHT
Line_2171	WIND WATERS YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILLS THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STONE AND THEN IT STARTED WEATHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF RUN TOO AND HIT A COUPLE ROCKS AND THEN SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
Line_2174	DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVERATUN AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A ROADED UNTIL
Line_2176	THE BOULDERS ARE THE BIGGEST THEY
Line_2177	DEALS OF GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE DELTA GRAVEL HAS BEEN IN THEIR WEIGH MORE THAN THE BOLBERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING AMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN STREET
Line_2179	BLUE ANYBODY THERE CHEDRALE HEADLE
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CAMICAL WEATHERING PHYSICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHANGE ROCK S
Line_2182	LET'S GO COME ON DO YOU LIKE U
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER AS DRAIN THAT'S HITTING THE LIMESTONE AND CINIGRATING
Line_2184	WHAT IS A WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT ONE IS A
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S ACID RAIN IS COMING DOWN AND SHIFTING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE LI
Line_2186	RAIN IMPRESSIT
Line_2187	THE ROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT TOOK TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SANDSTONE THE RAIN FREEZES DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMAGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIMESTONE AFTER ACID RAIN AFTER A YEARS STILL HAD
Line_2190	ITS DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HE LOSE ANYBODY THERE E
Line_2192	IT UPBRAGED AND ERODED
Line_2193	ACID RAIN AND ALSO ARROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE A CUT BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE ROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CUP BANKS
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS COLLID
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ISLANDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITION
Line_2199	THE SCREAM TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ES IN CLASS
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND EROSION
Line_2201	EROSION AND THE IT'S IN DELTA AND A CANIAN
Line_2202	THE WATER CAME OUT AND LEFT A TRAIL OF WATER T I MEAN MUD
Line_2203	IT'S THE DATA
Line_2204	THE S CHALINIUM
Line_2205	POSITION POSITION
Line_2206	ME WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
Line_2207	IT'S A VALLEY AND WHEN WE HAVE A FLOW
Line_2208	IT DON'T GO FOR A WHILE AT
Line_2209	EROSION AND ERTHMATOLO CIRCUIT CARRIED AWAY
Line_2210	ELTA DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING A EXACT THING THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREAM TABLES
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE IS NOT EVEN CLOSED TO THE BOAT
Line_2213	AT THAT FLAT IS MENTERING AND THEN STEEP IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEEP SLOPE IS GOING VERY FLAT FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND A CORNERS
Line_2215	TE FLUD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONES IS VERY DEPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GONE OUT
Line_2218	IT'S HAIR IN THE FLOOD
Line_2219	IT GOES FASTER
Line_2220	THE WATER RISES IN WHEN THERE IS A FLOOD
Line_2221	ITS QUITE
Line_2222	PLANTS IN THE EARTH MOVING
Line_2223	VALCAINERUPTIO N
Line_2224	H LAND SLIDE
Line_2225	SLONG AND SLOW
Line_2226	ERS SLOW
Line_2227	I THINK SLOW IS
Line_2228	MINERALS
Line_2229	THAT THEY'RE NOT ROCKS
Line_2230	MINIARRILES
Line_2231	WE I USED THEM
Line_2232	MINERALS GO INTO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MINERALS
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCALE TO SEE HOW HARD R ARE WE DID THIS IN CLASS
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPPENS THERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIMEN CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WHY DOES IT ALWAYS MAKES A MARK
Line_2237	IT DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	NO DOLLAR HIVE
Line_2240	THIS IS SO SAID I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
Line_2241	ONLY STUMMIG ARTOIN'S HAD
Line_2242	LOCK CAN SCRATCH THE TILE YEAH
Line_2243	IT MAKES A T A PATH
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH A SOLUTE TO MAKE A A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS PICTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	THEY
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GREAT TA STICK
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WAT
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T USE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST ADDS
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CH-
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSONS WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICED THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION IN THE IN
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTERS TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS A SOL
Line_2258	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT CAUGHT AND THE COFFY FIL
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIX
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET OUT IN THE SALT
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPOR
Line_2263	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER PAPER AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND IN THE CON
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG D
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2266	I I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWICE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE ON
Line_2270	I I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTR
Line_2272	THIS I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
Line_2273	MEAN S BYE
Line_2274	THE PENNY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE COURT OR
Line_2275	THE PENNY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE E
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTIO
Line_2278	IT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWED IN THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONES WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LIGHTER IF WE ADD THE LIGHTER SALT SOLUTION LAST THEN IT WON'T THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON TOP
Line_2284	HEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION BE IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	USE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_2286	THAT'S SO COOL
Line_2287	A A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATERS
Line_2289	T THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUSOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE EACH TOO
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SHOGER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINERS
Line_2295	THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHS
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT IN THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAT
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UHM
Line_2299	I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH S
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH ITS SOLUTIONS WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAYS
Line_2302	I GIVE YOU- THAT

Line_2391	THE WATER WENT UP SLOPE OR
Line_2392	THE FLAT THE WATER IS FALLING SLOWLY AND ON THE STEEP SILL THE WATER IS FINE
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FLOW THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T STUFF

Line_2503	O THAT THEY THERE ARE TWO'S SOFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOMETHINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHTS WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BANGING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BALANCING OFF EVERY THING AND AND AWAY Y
Line_2509	R REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BOUNCING OFF ALL THE METERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEEN THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WEIGHT LIGHT S
Line_2515	IT'S WEIGH
Line_2516	EVERY WHERE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IT IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLACS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BE BECOMES BLUE
Line_2520	THE RED HEADING NEVA L IS WIGHT AND THE RAYS COMING OFF TO BULB ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECT IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS AINBO
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BULB AND THEN MIX THE W
Line_2524	I THINK IT GETS OBSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BULB
Line_2525	THE A BULB IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLUE LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE A RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREENS
Line_2529	HUNG RE
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	H THE ONES BEHIND IT BURNS OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TWO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TOO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WER-
Line_2537	AS THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE IT FEELS

Line_2544	A PLANT MAKES ITS OWN ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND TIRE
Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE EDUCED
Line_2546	IT MEANS IT YOU EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET
Line_2547	ANIMALS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN SET THE ENERGY TOGETHER
Line_2549	THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD GUNS AND ANIMAL THEY CAN
Line_2550	YOU ALWAYS BEAT PLANTS AND ERB

Line_2560	THEY TURNS INTO DESERT
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES SAND AND WATER AND MIXTURE THAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAING THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE A SALT
Line_2567	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID AND THIS MIXTURE IS THE WATERS
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES IT'S DISSOLVING
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND THE RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PEANUTS REASONS AND MINI
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHT'S COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWED THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	ITS IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALTS DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIXED DROOR
Line_2578	BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I I THINK IT'S PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILTER OUT A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTIONS
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WE N IT'S A SOLUTION SORRY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED WITH THE WATER GRIP TASTIC IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENTS A SOLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCALE TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO C
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE A LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	THEY WOULD TAKE SHIGEARER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO I
Line_2593	THE TASTE IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS I
Line_2594	TH CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE IS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATER IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COOL AID BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE COLD
Line_2597	I'M HAVING A BAD DAM MARNEY
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A PIPE OF GAS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK ST O TWO WASN'T CREATED
Line_2601	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TEARN IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE REACTIONS
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBBLY L
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING IN WA WATER IS MISSING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THING'S MOLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE SE
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE AT
Line_2611	THE REACTING MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PRODUCT MOLECULES
Line_2612	FIT THEY UM REPEATED PILES
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE OF MOLECULE AND THE SOLUTIONS
Line_2616	TURNING THE WATER IS GAINING MOLECULES FROM THE HIGDROLIC ACID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT FALL
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAR AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED BURN
Line_2619	NOT THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FIZZED UP AND THEN COOL DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A CETERA PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FALL
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS HEATED ON TO THE PAINT TRUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NOT THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BY MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN MAKING SANWIGES RIDING ON UNICOINS AND PLAYING MAR
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2627	THE SALTED IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	A ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
Line_2630	TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATED
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYED ON THE TOP
Line_2634	ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A EVERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE TEAM HERE IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATE
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT GOES
Line_2638	SOLID MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE A
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT I I'S AT EQUIVOLENT Y
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED URBLES
Line_2648	EL THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	CONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNIE
Line_2650	THAT TELLS US THAT IT IS A A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION B
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	I COULD BYE YOUR MY BESTEST FRIEND
Line_2656	WHAT YOU WON'T TO TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	UM THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICLE SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELPS YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALLED THEM TOOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SURE MARNEY UM AT SINCE
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK B
Line_2660	ELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MAGNET
Line_2661	I I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OOH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTIONS AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS A LOT MORE GRAPETASTIC POWDER IN ITS
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE DARK COLOURED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED D
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THEN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE REALLY GROWS AND JUST REALLY DISCUSS THING AND YEAH THAT'S REALLY UH REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE PRETTY BLAMES COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE B LAND AND A LOT MORE TASTE LESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU I I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND AN OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU M KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WON'T YOU- YOU CAN'T UNLESS YOU TASTE IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE ITS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THESE SOLIDS IN IT ARE DIFFERENT PROPERLY
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND A THEY
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY U
Line_2684	THE PAPERCLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZED
Line_2685	S TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEE AND THE STONE STAYED ON TO
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SEE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFY FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFY FILT
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN ES TO THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPARATE THE SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOU ARE PUTTING THE POWDER IN TO THE WATER
Line_2692	TO DAY MARNEY WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTED A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW HI UH
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SEE A IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2698	I I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2700	THE PENNY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORK
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY
Line_2702	ITS WILL FLOW
Line_2703	UM OKAY AMONG CRUCHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEAN THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTIONS IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS A ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY'RE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS A WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BOY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE AS EACH OTHER
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION P PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT A I'M NOT SURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTIONS IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION B IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2723	IT BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGURED THE SOUTH BY W
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHOOGER ARABIATS THE OTHER WAY IT
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH A SOLUTIONS
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERST-
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE C IS SALT ARMIEN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WEIGHT CRYSTALS
Line_2734	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPSOM SALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ON E
Line_2737	I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST CON I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
Line_2740	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2741	REACT TONS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT S
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTION
Line_2745	SOIL VENT
Line_2746	I I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF WEARED STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASSY
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GAS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERY FLIES
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKES BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED IN FIZZ A LOT
Line_2754	THERE IS SOME LITTLE WEIGHT STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY'RE MISSING SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WITH HIGH DROP
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECULES ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A LITTLE A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPLE
Line_2757	IT'S UM THERE ARE MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACT THINGY
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCTS TURN PINK
Line_2760	THE FINAL PRODUCTS TURNED PINK
Line_2761	TON SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFINITELY A REACTION HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FIZZING
Line_2763	THE WA THE BUBBLES IN THE CARBONATED WATER ARE CARBON BULB
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOAKING INTO ITS BONE S
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST H
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE BIKE
Line_2768	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTIONS AND IT GLOWS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO A GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING ON
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ARCCURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S HAPPENING
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE EVENTUAL MASS IS
Line_2776	YEAH THIS TELLS US THAT WE
Line_2777	IT I'M REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE A MANY ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT I MARNEY
Line_2780	M MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MIX THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE PLANETS THE REASONS AND THE EMINEMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PUTS RAISINS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILE S
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPPENS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISCINIGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH D
Line_2786	THE SOLUTION YOU KIN
Line_2787	SOLUTES
Line_2788	A A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S EARLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR STICK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	I MARNEY I LOT OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYE I'LL SEE YOU IN YOU WORST MATES
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GETTING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE A SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PEES IS SOLVENT OH YEA OH YEAH UH YEAH I D
Line_2797	SORRY MARNEY HAVE TO GO CA AS SEE YOU LATER B
Line_2798	I'M DOING GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE'RE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALTY AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TOOTHPICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE FAN IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCK SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOES
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBBLES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO FEST THROUGH THE FAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT STING IT ON THE HOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PEVLES ARE GETTING STUCK IN THE FAN KAY MARNEY
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2807	Y SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT HE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBBLES THE SMALLER PEBBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THEN WOULD TAKE A TILE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK ON TO THIS S
Line_2811	I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ONTO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WOULD STACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALIZED THAT THE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREENS
Line_2814	YOU USE A SLEEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEELS
Line_2815	TO HAVE WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBBLES GOT STUCK AND THEY FILTER
Line_2816	S SO THAT IT'LL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VAPOR S N
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNEY
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU KIN
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT RESOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GRAPE TAC STICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	WELL ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE IT MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAD MORE FLAVOR
Line_2827	ONE WILL BE A A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	ITS HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	S SWEETER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRASPIER
Line_2832	ADD MORE GRAPETASTIC
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN OKAY BYE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RED
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCES YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SHOOGR
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SNAIL
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE D IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ICED CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN WELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHART I
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2844	IN THE PICTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFY SALAD BEAMS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED A PURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING ONTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATED GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLES
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WON'T BACK TOGETHER AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY-
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	OR THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALT WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVED
Line_2862	WE CALLED THEM A SOLLUTE
Line_2863	THE SAND STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLL THE WATER IS PLAYING AND THIS PIXTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE A ROLES PLACE IN THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT- WEIGH MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILES MIX
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREIGTER
Line_2877	A MIXTUR
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MEAN
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MEAN
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE ME MAM BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWN AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO AN AH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	HORRIBLE TODAY THINK'S FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS AND THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS A TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT AWAY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PREDICTION MY RODICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SORRY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DETERMINE IS BY TASTING THE
Line_2900	WE ARE SAYING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCES I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BE CAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AMOUNT OF WATERS
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASSES
Line_2909	YOU IDENTIFYIED THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATERS WITH THE SUB
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO A IT BUBBLE
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CHEMICALS THE
Line_2917	IT'S AN ADDITION PROVILUM
Line_2918	I- I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2919	THE A BAG CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MORE
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNOW THAT QUESTION OPEN THE ONE
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE THEY ARE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL I KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS A CREAN
Line_2927	THE VILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S WAIT TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
Line_2929	GETS THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE OTHER TWO ALL MIXED YOU'RE
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING REASONS AND MINIMS OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY'RE TALKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BRINGING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER
Line_2934	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SAND STAYED ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE S A
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SOUND A SOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKES A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	WE CALL THAT A SOLLUTE
Line_2944	T BECAUSE THE GRAPE STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVES IN THE OTHER AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THE SAME PROPERLY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTIONS
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIENT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE OF S
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IT'S A SOLUT
Line_2953	THE SOLUTE EAT THE SOLID SOL
Line_2954	ALU IS WHERE ONE INGOODENT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVE
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS WHAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURE
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSES HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY KEEP THEIR SAME MASS S
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT USES ANY M
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX SO AND THE SHOE STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF ITS PROTICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX YEA
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT AN SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTIO
Line_2965	APPARATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SEPARATE NOW
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARNED THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	R IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEY'RE PROPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILLTALS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MAG THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THE POTICAL SIZE IT'S SCALE THAN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	M PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTIAL S
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	POTICAL SIZES AND MAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PERNICAL SIDE AND MAGNETISM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS SWIT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETIC IN IT
Line_2981	I NOTICE THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	IT DON'T GO LIKE MARNEY BUT
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE THEY ARE
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THAN ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PURPLE STUFF
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTES YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_2991	THE VITAL COLO SOLUTIONS ARE MORSE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH HA MOLEGRAP POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE GREAP AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GREAP
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UM ONE WITH LESS GRAPE POWDER WE'LL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TASTE IS NOT AS THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	M YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE ER LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WHAT'S AIR MARTIE
Line_2998	BY MARTY
Line_2999	BAD WE'VE BEEN LEARNING C
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU CAN TELL IF IT'S MORE CONSCIONICKETED IF UM IT'S DARK
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3003	MY PRODICTION WAS RAFT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MOST CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	WELL MAN IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTING
Line_3006	BYE THE'RE WEIGHT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THE NUMBER TWO IS SO LE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	THE ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND BUT TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRAT
Line_3009	N
Line_3010	UH THAT'S WE LEARNED ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3011	THE CORK IS LESS DINGED THAN THE PENNY AND THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE COOL
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	N THE SOLUTION A THEY WOULD SINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRARSTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY
Line_3016	THE MORE WILL STINK TO THE
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WELL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYED AT THE DOOR
Line_3019	THE AURDENCITY CAME FROM THE THE AURDICITY BECAME THE SAME
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHT ONE
Line_3021	IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GRAY IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN GRAMS THEN I
Line_3022	SEE YOU THIRSDAY
Line_3023	UM YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTIO
Line_3024	IT'S FOGGY AND THIS IT'S ALL BLINDED IN
Line_3025	THEY CHOOSE TO MAKES A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3027	THE UHM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	T REACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN MET
Line_3031	THEY ARE THE PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THE AND A REACT
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUR SCOOPS OF CICUICITUID ACID ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EASOM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING THE A LIMIT OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DICITIES THAT
Line_3035	DEN CITY YEAH AND CONSOL AND SATURDAY
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMES ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATERS
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBSTANT NUMBER NINE
Line_3040	I'M DOING ALUM
Line_3041	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	YA'SRECENTS
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CAT ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLED THESE REACTIONS TO ALL
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
Line_3047	A HAM QUA THEY'RE S SAME PROD
Line_3048	I I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3049	I AM H
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3051	ALL OF THEM MOLECUES AND THE DIFFERENT UM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UM UH
Line_3052	ITS CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE EARTH AND A NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE CONFERENCEVATION MASS
Line_3055	THE IT SKIPS ARE FLOATING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FOG
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE PUT
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLED
Line_3058	A SYMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTIONS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	ITS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTING TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES THE CANILLCURRACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE
Line_3062	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS FOLDED AND HA
Line_3063	THE GLOW STICK IS BEING GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
Line_3064	YES A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3065	CONSOLPATION
Line_3066	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GREAT TASTE IS ADDED TO THE WATER
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	AND ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CHEM IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE UH NOT I SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE A S
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKEN APART
Line_3075	THE THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A M
Line_3076	CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT WE
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FILT
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULLED ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT'S LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED A
Line_3080	UM YOU WE CALL IT A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARS AND GOES INTO THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NO I TH
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	Y BY UH CAN YOU PLA ONE CENTENCE ITCHES
Line_3085	COULD HAT YOUR FACE WHILE YOU SO WELL GO
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3087	THE UH SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPEAR
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISAPPEARS AFTER BEING MIXED TO THE WATERS
Line_3090	IT'S SOLVENT
Line_3091	E EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE UHM
Line_3093	ITS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	IT WHERE A CLOUD
Line_3095	HOPING UP THE BEDS THERE MARINE

Line_3163	WE HAD A WE HAD A SUGAR THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT IT'S LIKE LIKE LIKE WHICH ONE WAS RAT
Line_3164	YOU OF GOT THAT ARE TO ACT
Line_3165	YOU'RE POURING THE VINEGAR AND THE SOLUTION BAKING SODA INTO WATER AND THEN A
Line_3166	A CHEMICAL REACTS
Line_3167	I FORGOT MARNIE
Line_3168	THE VINEGAR IS REACTING THE BAKING SODA IS REACTING AND THE AND THE WARM LIKE THE CUP IS A PRODUCT
Line_3169	SHOT HAVE BE REPEATED THAT EATERS SHOT
Line_3170	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3171	REACTING
Line_3172	REACT TO
Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK DIM BUT I THINK I I THINK THEY'RE WIRES
Line_3174	I SEE IN THE VINEGAR I SEE OCIGIN AND HI
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCAGIEN AND HI ATTMS IN THE VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEANS THEY ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND A DIFFERENT TIPS
Line_3177	THE AIM IS WET TO BE DIFFERENT
Line_3178	IT'S FIZZING FOR A LONG LONG UHM
Line_3179	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER
Line_3180	BAKING AND CAC CLI
Line_3181	IT'S FACING BEING BEING IN AT RECAP WHEN YOU

Line_3184	THE AT THE ARE BLUE BLUE POT OUT AT THE WIRE BEL
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE UM LIKE JARS THAT'S SOR
Line_3186	THERE WAS REACTION THAT LIKE THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY COOL AND I LIKE LOVED
Line_3187	THE WATER OR SUBSTANCES POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE'S MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FADED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NAH KEE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE B
Line_3190	ITS STARTED FIZZING SO AND ONE IS FIZZING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION S TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR
Line_3192	IT GETS TURN GREEN IT WAS GREY IT
Line_3193	A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED BECAUSE THE WATER TURN RAIN WITH THE TRIP OF CURRENT FLOW
Line_3194	I IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TURN
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER CURRENT PURPLE N IT USED TO BE BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THE REST COULD DEER IN PUT THE WATERS TO AN PAP
Line_3197	IT DIDN'T WELL NO IT DIDN'T THERE WAS TOO MUCH IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST LIKE STAYED THERE

Line_3203	THEY'RE WEIGHING TWO ON TWO DIFFERENT SCALES ON THE
Line_3204	THE THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IT WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE TH THE BAG THAN BECAUSE IT HAS AIR INSIDE IT TRAP INSIDE OF IT
Line_3205	THE AIR MOLECULES ARE TRAPPED INSIDE THE CLOSED BAG BUT LEFT OUT AND BALANCED INSIDE THE OPEN BAG
Line_3206	WE'VE BEEN MAKING HUMUS FOR REDDIGLARS
Line_3207	OUR HUMAN BODIES A SUIT
Line_3208	THIS IS A PART OF THE SYSTEM
Line_3209	WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_3210	EVERY THING SUPPORT THE CAR
Line_3211	THIS HOLE BODY IS A SISTM
Line_3212	IT'S TELLING YOU YOU WHAT WHAT PART OF THE SUSTOM IT IS
Line_3213	IT THOSE THINGS THAT THEY IT
Line_3214	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE SHHOMAN BODY
Line_3215	RATING MUCH HO EVERY THING TO MAKE IT A SYSTEM
Line_3216	I THINK ER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT HAS COUNTRIES AND THAT'S WHAT MIX
Line_3217	THEY WORK TOGETHER
Line_3218	I THINK IT'S AN OPTION WERE AN IOLIND

Line_3223	THEY ALL HAVE SOME THEY ALL HAVE LAND
Line_3224	LOOKS LIKE UM H UM A FOR CHAIN
Line_3225	I THINK IT'S A SO THAT'S GETTING THINGS LIKE ANIMALS AT OTHER PLANTS
Line_3226	I KNOW IF THIS THAT UM THAT'S OF BUGS HAVE LOTS OF B
Line_3227	THEY'RE LIKE FLAME BUT THE ANIMALS AM IS
Line_3228	I'M LEARNING OF THE CATERPILLARS AND COMPOSERS TING COMPOSER
Line_3229	THEY'RE IN EX COMPOSERS D COMPOSERS AND CIRCULARITY TOO
Line_3230	COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY GLASS SAID
Line_3231	TRICALLY THEY'RE WE SAY IT ARE
Line_3232	IRON OR YOU CAN YOUR OR FULLY BACK OR MORE I
Line_3233	OR THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
Line_3234	UH THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCE
Line_3235	BEING A COMPOSERS YOU EAT THE PRODUCERS SO THAT THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEY'RE IN
Line_3236	UH D COMPOSER IT'S THE COM MAR
Line_3237	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUME
Line_3238	THE CAR SOON WAS A BUNNY AND WITH THE AND UM THE BERRAD AND THE LIZARD
Line_3239	AM PRIMARY THEIR RAPPETS ONE OF THE PRIMARY COMES
Line_3240	BACTERIA AND FUNGI
Line_3241	IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING IT
Line_3242	FINISH I STOPPED TO FINISH IT CARNEVARS MARS DA WA
Line_3243	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THIGESTION
Line_3244	THEY THEY'RE ALL GET IT
Line_3245	I THESE APPRADUCERS AND THES THE CONSUMERS IN THESE SIDES D COMPOSERS
Line_3246	THE PRTUCORS B COMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_3247	THEY GET THEIR N
Line_3248	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY GIVING THE FUMES FROM THE PRODUCER THE PRODUCER THAT ENERGY IT WEIGHS
Line_3249	I CO SOME THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCERS TO GET IT'S ENERGY
Line_3250	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE IT CONSUMNATES THE PRODUCER
Line_3251	A SO ONE THAT EATS PLANT
Line_3252	IT'S ON THERE EATS PLANTS AND
Line_3253	SISTIOMS
Line_3254	CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND A COMPOSERS
Line_3255	IT IS ABOUT THE FOOD WEB AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_3256	THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUMES THEM
Line_3257	ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THE GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PRTES SOME WITH THE
Line_3258	A D COMPOSER IS ALL ABOUT COMPOSERS UM
Line_3259	THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN FOOD WIT BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
Line_3260	WE TALKS FIRST SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMERS
Line_3261	AND TREVOR IS THE HURBOR IT EATS PLAIN
Line_3262	A CURENTOFAR IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AN UMNEVARN UMNEVORDY BERRIES AND MEAT
Line_3263	THEY MEAT SIDE OF THEIR AREA
Line_3264	OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS S
Line_3265	THEY WOULD EAT DEAD PLANTS AND I T
Line_3266	THIS IS A D COMPOSER OR RED WIGGLAR WARM IT DECOMPOSES ED PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN IT INTO SOIL
Line_3267	A RED WARM IS A DECOMPOSED
Line_3268	D COMPOSERS CREATE SOIL RICH AND SOIL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR PECIES AS RICH AND SOIL
Line_3269	THE WASTED MATERIALS TURN IN A RIDGE SOIL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEEKS

Line_3284	HA MARNEY HOW YOU DON'T SAY
Line_3285	IT'S A IT THAT'S THE BELT TOGETHER
Line_3286	WELL YOU'RE A SISTM BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A COMPUTER THAT'S RIGHT
Line_3287	I WON'T HAVE A SCIENCE CLASS BUT IT IS A SYSTEM I MEAN ALIMENTURY NOT NOT A MITTAL SCOOL
Line_3288	MAGNATE LEOUISHIA LEUISHIE LOUIS
Line_3289	IT IS STOP BE BOXING MY MARNEY CAN HEAR YOU
Line_3290	THAT IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SA SOMETHING
Line_3291	IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT IS UH
Line_3292	IT IS SHOWING THE DIJECTIVE SISTOM THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM AND THE SCELICAL SIT
Line_3293	THE RESCPITORY SISTOM
Line_3294	THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE HEART IS PART OF THE RESPIRATORY SISTIOM
Line_3295	THAT ONCE AGAIN WE'RE WRONG HEART RESPRETORY BUT
Line_3296	IT IS SPILT UP OF MANY GRAVITY POLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKES THE EARTH QUAKE IRON S
Line_3297	IT IS A SYSTEM GOD I DON'T HAVE TO RIGHT THIS STAMP BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT EARTH
Line_3298	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE EARTH GRAMITATIONAL PULL MOVE

Line_3303	THE BUBBLES FI IS MADE OF GRASS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER LIKE UNNORMAL THING
Line_3304	THERE IS A DESERT A BOURLEINA FORIST AND A W
Line_3305	THEY ARE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH
Line_3306	THE REST OF THE TILES FAIR IS MADE OUT OF LIKE LIKE WET LANDS AND STUFF I DON
Line_3307	YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND ANY MORE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
Line_3308	FILE ASK TIME HOW TO ST COMPUTER
Line_3309	S
Line_3310	THE LEAST STUDY THING MAIN
Line_3311	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE EST IS BREAKING ITS DORMANSE
Line_3312	THAT THE EASE IS MAKING IT'S DORMANCY I JUST SAID THAT ASKED
Line_3313	IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS A
Line_3314	THAT THEY ARE YEAH ONE HAD SHE'S FOR MY EXBOCX
Line_3315	HOW DID YOU DUMP IT IN THE CRASH AGAIN
Line_3316	THAT THE S IS ALIVE LIKE FRINCASTIM
Line_3317	THE ONE WEE PLANT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH STUFF
Line_3318	THAT IT GROES THE POINTS START OUT AS THE SEED AND THEN TURN TO THE PLANT
Line_3319	IT MADE ME THE WATER SUNLIGHT AND SEE O TOO
Line_3320	SPACES FOR HIM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE US HUMANS NEED WATER SURVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUIDS
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUDS
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AIR BUT IT MATTERS ON IF IT STEAL A TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON TO SIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OCCIGEN FOR US
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF THE SYSTEM
Line_3327	YES BECAUSE IT COULD DRIVEN THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBURGER I DON'T I THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBURGERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOOD SO NOT
Line_3330	IT SHOWS PLANTS WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE FOAM IN IS IT
Line_3332	THOSE ARE SINGLE CELL ORGANISMS OR YEAH
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	BUT THEY'RE IN MUSSLE SELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE YOU EXRSIZE
Line_3337	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS FROM A MUSCLES
Line_3338	THAT THEY ARE PART A BRAIN
Line_3339	I SEE SKIN
Line_3340	THAT THEY MAKES UP YOUR SKIN
Line_3341	SELVES AND RESPRTORE MADE UP THE SKELETAL DIGESTIVE NERVOUS MUCULAR AND REPATORY SISTOM
Line_3342	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE OUT OF FU

Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECOND ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3356	A BREATHING IT'S ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR SELLS GET OCCIGIEN AND CARRY THEM TO YOU
Line_3358	TWO THE GET A MINI
Line_3359	T FIRST WELL CAN'T CLICK ON IT SO
Line_3360	EE I CHOSE JE
Line_3361	I THINK THE THONGS PROVIDE AIR TO ALL THE SELVES IN OUR BODY AND GET WEARS SEE OUT TWO
Line_3362	BY
Line_3363	BECAUSE IT'S A LEAF AND I TOLD YOU WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAFS RIGHT SAI HAD
Line_3364	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3365	THERE LEAPES
Line_3366	M FINE
Line_3367	ABOUT THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SISTOM AND WHAT WE USE FOR FOR US TO BREATH
Line_3368	IT IS EVEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FARM AND THE ZILOM
Line_3369	IT IS SO YEAH
Line_3370	THE SMELL SEC AND THE MILES AND THE LUNGS OF WELL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN LUNGS HAS IN YEA
Line_3371	HUH WE'VE BEEN UM
Line_3372	THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE RAN ENO SISTM
Line_3373	UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE EARTH ON A CARS
Line_3374	BECAUSE THE WHEELS AND THE AXLE ARE BOTH PART OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE COLOR ROLE
Line_3375	A A TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS ON THE CAR
Line_3377	I SEE UM THE AXLES AND THE WEALS WHICH HELP THE CAR MO
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS IN THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE VINS THE LUNGS AND THE HEART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEM
Line_3381	IT HAS THE EARTH IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SYSTEM LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUB SYSTEMS IN IT TO HELP THE EARTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREES HOUSES AND AN OPTION
Line_3384	THEY'RE PART OF UH NATURE AND HUMANS
Line_3385	I THINK THE BLOW SPILL IS MADE OF OF THE ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND TREES AND NOT HOUSES AROUND
Line_3386	I SEE THAT ALL THE ECO SYSTOMS IN THE EARTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BURN FOR FOREST THE WHITE LANDS AND THE DESERT
Line_3387	I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP REPRESENT HOLES KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3388	THE B SPERE IS MADE OF OF SAND AND LIVING CREATURES
Line_3389	IT'S ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND WHAT THEY L
Line_3390	THE FOOD WHAT IT MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF EIGOSSISTOMS THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT THEN
Line_3391	I
Line_3392	HE
Line_3393	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3394	WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
Line_3395	D WE HAVE BEEN BEEN LEARNING THAT
Line_3396	UH WE HAVE A FOOT AND
Line_3397	IT GETS AS I NOTICED THAT THE SUN
Line_3398	BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT GOES IN TO HIM IN THE SUN
Line_3399	GETTING ALL THE FOOD FROM THE THING THAT EATS THE PLANT TO GET THE SUN'S ENERGY AND WHAT YE
Line_3400	THAT IS ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT GROW ON THE GROUND AND BACK AREAS YOU GET IT
Line_3401	THE- THE GRASS
Line_3402	I DON'T I
Line_3403	SU MAR THE CONSUMERS EAT UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_3404	THE DEER EATS THE WA AND THE RAT EATS THE GRASS
Line_3405	M BECAUSE IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_3406	AN CARNIVORE EATS MEAT
Line_3407	EACH IRONY TOLD YOU VE
Line_3408	BECAUSE CRUMBLES AND THEN
Line_3409	ON THE VORE ONLY EAT BERRIES AND UHM ME
Line_3410	EAT AND BERRY
Line_3411	THEY EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVEN CARS
Line_3412	D CAN OVER EACH AS THE STUFF FELL ROUND
Line_3413	D COMPOSERS EAT RAW THINGS ON LAND
Line_3414	BAR AND MOST CONSEALL AMOUNT
Line_3415	AND UM THE AREA
Line_3416	A CONNE BON
Line_3417	ERTHMORMS ARE COMEVORMS AND IT
Line_3418	THAT THEY LIKE THAT ENVIRONMENT W
Line_3419	THEY WILL DEL HOLES IN IT AND EAT THE FOOD INSIDE THE DIRT
Line_3420	IT CREEP UP SO THAT IT HAS NEW THINGS IN THE THE WORLD
Line_3421	DOING LITTLE HEART HOW ARE YOU
Line_3422	IT LOOKS LIKE LIKE OR A BUNCH OF WARMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
Line_3423	OUT OF THE PLANTS IN THE GROUND LIKE THE RUST
Line_3424	A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS A
Line_3425	UH THE LIVING SACS AND THE OTHER PLAN
Line_3426	WHEN I CLICK ON THE LEG I NOTICE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE BUGS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3427	MUSCLE SIDE ARE THE MOST PART OF THE BODY SO THAT YOU CAN RUN OR WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
Line_3428	THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ONLY
Line_3429	I SEE THAT THE BRAIN IS NUMARONS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE THE A PERSON SMART
Line_3430	THE BRAIN SAYS WHAT THE NEURONS COMING OUT OF THEM
Line_3431	THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF A CALLED NEURONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND NEW NEURON COMES OUT
Line_3432	I SEE SOME SORT OF DESIGN BUT I CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS
Line_3433	IMPORTANT OF THESE KIND OF SKIN SELLS IS HOW WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HEALTHY HEARTS
Line_3434	THAT THEY HELP HOLED THEIR SKIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
Line_3435	THEY ARE MADE OF FLESH AND THAT DISC SELLS CONNECTS TO
Line_3436	UH YES BECAUSE UH THE ANIMALS A MAGNET MAN UH HAVE THE SAME SKIN SO
Line_3437	I NOTICE A BUNCH OF LITTLE SELLS IN THE YEAST AND IN THE SKIN SELLS
Line_3438	I THINK THEY COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW US OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF SELVES THAT ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS HAD
Line_3439	I SEE SOME SORT OF WEARED LITTLE SELLS IN THE UH PLANT SELLS THAT'S DIFFER MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN SELLS
Line_3440	THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT DIFFERENT TIPS OR SELLS EACH ANIMAL HAD
Line_3441	WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT UMINES AND SELVES IS UHM ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
Line_3442	THERE IS A LANG SCREEN AND FIRNOME
Line_3443	ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGESTIVE ISTMOHU
Line_3444	DIGESTIVE CYSTOMS HELP YOUR FOOD BREAK DOWN AND GO INTO THE BLOOD
Line_3445	IT BREAKS DOWN THROUGH E
Line_3446	AFIGUS LEADS THE FLUIDS INTO THE STUMIC
Line_3447	THE LIQUID ACID
Line_3448	THEY ARE THE BRING IS PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3449	THE LAND TESTANCES CAR THE WEST REMOVAL AND THE SMALL INTESTINE IS FOR THE FOOD TO GO DOWN
Line_3450	WELL THE JUST FOOD YOU HE'LL GO UNDER A BROAD STREEN
Line_3451	ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND A AND ALL OF THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3452	THE UPPER EAST STAY SAL
Line_3453	OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL SEALS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_3454	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING SPELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3455	OF THE HERMIT BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR SPELLS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINT PALMATE AND ANOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPE AND SIZES
Line_3459	UH THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND ON THE LIKE THE AL MEAT HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
Line_3460	THEIR PATTERN ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIZE OF THE LEAF
Line_3461	HOW SOME B ARE DIFFERENT AND OTHERS
Line_3462	A PALM MATE AND PARALLEL
Line_3463	THAT IS A PALMAYGHTE
Line_3464	TO HOLD THE LEAFS TOGETHER
Line_3465	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3466	THE RESPIRATORY SISSTOM
Line_3467	I NOW KNOW
Line_3468	I THINK THE VASCULAR SYSTEM LE S ALL OF THE THINGS
Line_3469	ONE TWO GOES UP THE OTHER TWO GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LANDS
Line_3471	WHAT DOES WHEAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE BYE SEE IT LIKE UM
Line_3473	OOD
Line_3474	ITS UM ALL THE PLANETS OR MAN OUR SUN
Line_3475	BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING US THE SUN IN THE SOLAR FLOW
Line_3476	SO A DRAW LIKE MUGS
Line_3477	DRY STEEL BUTTONS AND ALSO THE INNER PLANET S
Line_3478	THE INNER PLANETS ARE SUPER SMALL
Line_3479	THE EARTH ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVITY WE WOULD STU AN A
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_3481	EARTH LUGGAGE COMPUTERS CARS THE HUMAN BODY AND THE UNIVERSE
Line_3482	IT L IT SAYS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN A DO
Line_3483	THEY SISTOM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SISTOM
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WHEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THE INVOLVING THE SYSTEM
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY ILIG
Line_3487	CAUSE IT IS AN EARTH IT IT'S THE EARTH AND THAT IS A S
Line_3488	ANT INTERACTING PARTS IN IN IT
Line_3489	I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVEING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKES OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN ONTION HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES
Line_3492	UM THERE ARE EGOCYSTUMS AND UM I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFRICA IT BROUGHT UP DESERT
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND DICE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	IT MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WE EAT THEM
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY'RE A A D COMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS OR BACTERIA A
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE
Line_3502	ERS CONSUMERS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_3503	A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATH AND MEAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHES IN SEE TO WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND THEY BREATHE OUR AIR WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE IN
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOODS
Line_3506	CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3509	IT IS A FOOD CHAIN OF MANY DIFFERENT TIN
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS AN OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	A HERBIVORE ONLY EATS PLANTS
Line_3512	THINK THAT IN ANYMORE MEANS THAT YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3513	I THINK A S COMPOSER IS
Line_3514	ED PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER UM THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE EARTH THAT HELPS IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS A A A A COMPOSER
Line_3517	A A CARNIVORE
Line_3518	IT IS A ER ERB
Line_3519	IT'S A D COMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE EARTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THE DEAD LEAVES AND THE NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOSE D
Line_3521	WORMS UM DO COMPOSE IT AND MAKE IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	ITS HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THIS STUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF THE BIG CIUM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD TO SI SUP
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE E
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BUG THE BIRD THE HOLK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3531	A COMPOSER IT'S DEAD PLANTS IN AN
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3533	THERE WE GO THE MUSHRUMS
Line_3534	-EAH A CONSUMER
Line_3535	A G COMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT UHM
Line_3537	BEING AN ERMIEVOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NOT PLAN
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NEITHER A HURT HERBIVORE OR A CALNIVOR OR A AMNIVOR
Line_3541	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOOSE IS A B
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOX IS A CARNIVORE
Line_3544	THEY ARE WARM THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY MAKE A COMPOST FOR GARDENS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	A RED WARM IS A A COMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKES COMPOST SO THAT GARDENS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CEILITUMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY SO YOU TELLS ME
Line_3550	EST IS A FUNGUS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN IT'S DORMANT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THE THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SOME LIGHT WATER AND SWEAAIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TOO HEAVY THE PLANT WILL DIE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SOME AND THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SURVIVES
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NEW TRAINS TO SERVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SEED BY FOTO SIN THIS
Line_3561	TOO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
Line_3562	PLANTS NEED SUN TO SURVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WILT
Line_3563	THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO
Line_3564	THE PLANTS GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEED EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SURVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIE AND WELL
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUNS AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DRIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SITTING THE BEE IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND THE THE GUESS A ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BE IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND IT IS BRINGING THE POLLEN BACK TO THE HONCOME
Line_3572	IT SHOWS THAT ONE BE WANTS OTHER BEANS TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	I RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DOORBELL RANG THE DOG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT IT'S MASS IT'S MASTERS
Line_3575	IT SLAPS THE MASKTO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE DOT THE DOORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULUS IS THAT THE DOG BARK
Line_3577	THAT IS A HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONES IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND THE
Line_3579	THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOME THI
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMALS AND THEY'LL HAVE DIGESTIVE SISTOMS
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGESTIVE SISOM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN A A ADAPTATION
Line_3583	THE SUNK IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DEFEND ITSELF FROM PREDATORS
Line_3585	IT'S A ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHOW BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SURVIVE FROM RED
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS ITS PATTERN ON IT'S BACK AND ON ITS BODY SO THAT IT CAN BECAMFLOGED IN WITH IT'S HALF A
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEAPE FEET
Line_3589	NUMBER TWO IT'S A TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS SO THAT I CAN FLY
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE MATTER AWAY
Line_3592	THE SNAKE HAS AN ABEPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTLE IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTLE SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMULUS
Line_3594	IT IS ENVOLVING A SUNCK WHICH IS FOOD FOR THE WOLF
Line_3595	AN ADAPTATION THAT THE SKUNK HAS IS ITS SMELL THAT MAKES THE SKUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SMELL THAT
Line_3596	UH UM WHAT DOES CLASSIFY MEAN
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BIRDS ARE FLYING N THE ONE IN THE FRONT IS THE LITER
Line_3598	ITS BEHAVIOR IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CATCHING THE DISC
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FRISBEE WHEN THE
Line_3600	NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
Line_3601	IT IS I NO AND LEARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3602	THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3603	THIS IS THEY NON LEARN BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT IMEDIATELY WHEN THEY'RE BORN
Line_3604	THE CAT FELL OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE SELLS ARE DIFFERENT THEN THE THEN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY UHM SELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINK
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY DRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUE
Line_3609	THE ALL THE BIG BULLS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3610	MANY BLUE SCELLS THAT LOOK LIKE SKIN
Line_3611	SKIN SMELLS HELP YOUR BODY RE HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN YEAST DOES
Line_3613	THE BUTTERFLY HAS FILLS AND ITS BODY AND IT SWINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SISTOM AND THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE OUR DIGESTIVE SISTM
Line_3616	IT'S SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTINES AND THE LUNGS
Line_3617	THE DIGESTIVE SIT IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW AND GET IT BACK OUT OF YOUR BODY
Line_3618	IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
Line_3619	THAT IS WHERE YOU SPHERE THE FOOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTINES
Line_3620	THEY TRAVEL THE FOOD TO HELPS IT GET OUT
Line_3621	IT IN THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3622	THIS IS TELLING YOU UM PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THEY
Line_3623	THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING INTO YOUR BODY AND GOING IN TO THE LUNGS AND THEN COMING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREATH
Line_3624	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATH TO BE ABLE TO IT
Line_3625	AIR COMES IN TO THE BODY THROUGH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH
Line_3626	THERE ARE TWOOBS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRINKEA AND GO DEEPEN INTO THE LUNG
Line_3627	D BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS LONG
Line_3628	AIR GETS TAKE IT INTO THE BODY BY WHEN YOU ITNHAIL IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
Line_3629	DON'T KNOW
Line_3630	GOOD HOW M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3631	IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SISTIOM
Line_3632	THE DOG CIRCULATORY SISTOM AND THE HUMAN CIRCULATORY SISTOM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAM
Line_3633	HAT IS OUR HEART AND SOME OF OUR BLOOD IS GOING INTO OUR HEART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
Line_3634	I SEE O TWO EACH TWO WOLVES COMING GOING OUT OF THE
Line_3635	THE BLUE POINT IS THE SELLS AND THE RED BREATH OF THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH THE CAVELLAR
Line_3636	THE BLUE PART IS THE SILL AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS ON USE CAVALR
Line_3637	I THINK THAT THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD UM THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
Line_3638	IT GOES THROUGH BLOOD VESSILES AND GOES INTO THE HEART AND GOES OUT OF THE HEART
Line_3639	I THINK THAT BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART SOME BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART AND SOME BLOOD COMES OUT OF THE S
Line_3640	A IT'S THE BLOOD VESSELS
Line_3641	SEE IS THE BLOOD AND IT IS THE BLOODSTREAM WHERE THE BLOOD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
Line_3642	THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS HOW YOU BREATHE
Line_3643	THAT IS ABOUT THE AIRS GOING INTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
Line_3644	AIR COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3645	THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3646	WELLINGS AND YES IT IS IN THE STORY THE STONE
Line_3647	THE DIAFAM THE DIAFRAM
Line_3648	WELL ACTUALLY I'VE A READY PASSED IT
Line_3649	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PART
Line_3650	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3651	IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT IN MOVES WITH ALL PARTS
Line_3652	IT'S YOUR BODY YOUR BODY IS A VERY BIG SYSTEM WITH SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3653	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3654	THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3655	WE HAVE INTERACTING PARTS AND SMALLER SISTOMS INSIDE OF YOUR BODY
Line_3656	SMALLER SISTOMS UP SISTOMS
Line_3657	IT HAS ILANDSOTIONS AND LIVING THINGS AS BY A SERIC ATMSFER AND OTHER SMALLER SUBSISTOMS
Line_3658	THEY IT HAS A BUS SPEER A
Line_3659	LA W ON I I THINK
Line_3660	LIVING THINGS
Line_3661	I HAS CREATURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
Line_3662	THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
Line_3663	GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
Line_3664	FOOD WEBS
Line_3665	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN D COMPOSE US D COMPOSE THE THEY CONSUMERS
Line_3666	BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_3667	THE GRASS AND THE PIG ONE
Line_3668	BY EATING EACH OTHER OR OR THE PRODUCERS
Line_3669	THE HAIR THE SNAKE THE HOOK THE BIRD THE BEAGLE AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3670	WHEN THE CONSUMER DIVE THEY DECOMPOSE THEIR BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF NATURE IS
Line_3671	THE DEAD BODIES AND TREES AND STUFF OF ANIMALS AND TRUE PLANT'S
Line_3672	THE BACTERIA AND THE MUSHROOM FUNGI
Line_3673	A BERRY OR PELIC PLAN
Line_3674	THAT ARE A THRUMS
Line_3675	MUSCRUM OR FUNGI
Line_3676	I DON'T KNOW I
Line_3677	CONSUMERS OR HUMAN
Line_3678	CAUMNEVORES AND UMNEVORIES AND HERBORSE
Line_3679	CONARES EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAT
Line_3680	THEY EAT PLANT IT ONLY PLANTS
Line_3681	PRIVITARS EAT ONLY PLANTS
Line_3682	YE HURBWAR
Line_3683	TO M L MAKE EAT PLANS THEY EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEET WEIGHT WE
Line_3684	A UM NERVOR
Line_3685	AND UM THE WATERS
Line_3686	TO EAT ONLY DEAD THINGS
Line_3687	ONLY A THEY E ONLY D DECOMPOSED TO STUFF OR DIED STUFF
Line_3688	A CON UM CARNIVORE
Line_3689	IT'S A D COMPOSER THEIR WORRUMS THEY EAT ONLY DID STUFF
Line_3690	A DE COMPOSER
Line_3691	THEY PRODUCE HEALTHY STUFF FOR LINES OR A AT ERTHWORKSM
Line_3692	MORE FOOD CHAINS IN FOOD WOODS BUT WE ALSO STUDIED UM LEVORES COUNOVORES AND HURBEHORS
Line_3693	A M ANIMAL CRACKER WHICH HAVE S SHUGER AND FLOWER AND WATER
Line_3694	I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM YEA AND GETTING ITS NETURS
Line_3695	VERY VARY A SO
Line_3696	WELL THE A UM PLANT ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
Line_3697	THE P ALSO NEEDS SUNLIGHT
Line_3698	OH LINES DON'T NEED HAND BEGGERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD BUT THEY PRODUCE THEIR UNDERWOOD BY USING SHOOGER SOME LIGHT AND WATER PAPER
Line_3699	PEEL I DOES MEAN REALLY MUD IS THE PRODUCES IT'S OWN THING
Line_3700	IT LOOKS LIKE CELLS
Line_3701	WE'VE BEING A EASE EXPERIMENT
Line_3702	SIT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
Line_3703	I IT LOOKS LIKE A FACTORY
Line_3704	I DO N NOT KNOW I FORGOT
Line_3705	THEY VECAL THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS OF THE BUSSL AND THE ILL DOTS IN BETWEEN
Line_3706	THEY LOOKS LIKE NERVES
Line_3707	NORMAL SELLS OLD SELLS
Line_3708	TIP TOE SAND
Line_3709	THEY'RE MADE OF SLID EVERYTHINGS MADE IT S EVERY LIVING THINGS MADE IT
Line_3710	YOU HAVE A LOT MORE SELLS THAN EACH
Line_3711	HUMAN BECAUSE IT WERE NOT JUST ONE CELL ORGAN ORGANISM LIKE DEE
Line_3712	THE BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT THE S
Line_3713	I FORGOT MMM A MISTAKE ABOUT THAT LIGHT YEAH I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_3714	THE DIGESTIVE SISTROM
Line_3715	WE BOTH HAVE DIGESTIVE ISTOMS
Line_3716	OUR DIGESTIVE SISPTOM
Line_3717	BREAKING DOWN FOOD AND GIVING OUR BODIES ENERGY
Line_3718	THE MOUTH BREAKS DOWN THE FOODS
Line_3719	THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMIC IT BRINGS THE FLUID DOWN TO THE STEEL MIX
Line_3720	BRINGS FOOD AND TO THE STOMMICK USING MUSSLES
Line_3721	IT BREAKS DOWN FOODS
Line_3722	TO BREAK DOWN FED AND A YEAH
Line_3723	THE INTESTINES EXSORBED ALL THE NEW TRANS IN WATER FOR IT TO USE FOR A BODY
Line_3724	IT GOES OUT WAS WHICH IS DISCUSSED SAND
Line_3725	IRE LEARNING ABOUT THE S AND PLANTS
Line_3726	IT'S ALL MINE
Line_3727	IT'S A P MINE OR SOMETHING A THAT NOT SUCH AS THE PE I THINK
Line_3728	GETTING FOOD FROM PLACE PLACE MAKING FOOD
Line_3729	FMEANS THE PLANT AND STUFF
Line_3730	UH THAT'S A BAGGER ROUND THE LEAVE THAT SHOWS WATER VAPER COMING OFF FROM THE LEAVE WHICH IS FAIRLY USEFULL
Line_3731	UM I FORGOT
Line_3732	LOCK A SHIN WHICH HELPS OUR BODY WHEN THAT HELPS MAKES OUR BODY LID
Line_3733	THEY BOTH HAVE HEARTS AND GAINS
Line_3734	THE SICULUETORY SISTOM
Line_3735	TH THE HEART ONE SIDE THE HEART PUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BODY THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMPS TO THE BACK
Line_3736	OCIGON FOOD WILL NUTURANTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WAS
Line_3737	BLUE ARE SELVES YEAH
Line_3738	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_3739	UM E FURNISH LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
Line_3740	BLOOD VESSELS THE HEART AND BLOOD
Line_3741	BLOOD'S GOING AND AND OUT
Line_3742	THERE MOUNT PRO MUCH THE THE VAINS DEILIVERY SYSTOM THE HEARTS DEILIVERY SYSTOM THEN THE VAINS IN THE RODS
Line_3743	GIVE FLOOD TO THE HEART AND TAKE IT AWAY
Line_3744	PRONOUNCE THE HIGH WAYS FOR BLOOD AND THEY ARE CALLED VEAINS IN ARTERY
Line_3745	UM THE PUMPS
Line_3746	SEE UHM DIE WELL HOLDS THE BLOOD
Line_3747	IT'S THE IT'S THE LINE THAT PRINICH MEAN THAT IT'S A RESPIRATORY SISTOM AND YEAH
Line_3748	IN THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SISTM
Line_3749	THE RESPTORE IS A CINTIMA IS RESPONSIBLE RATING ALIEN INTO YOUR BODY AND CARBONDYOCIDE OUT
Line_3750	THEY ARE GOING SAND AND OUT OF THE LUNGS AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OCIGE IN DEER SELLS AND GETTING CURBENDY OCCIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES IN AND FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE UM
Line_3753	THERE'RE TWO BS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF TO THE TRAQIEA AND DEEP AND GO DEEP INTO THE LOGS AND THEY POUR IN UH HOLD THE AIR SIDE
Line_3754	CELLS ARE DR UH CARBONDAOCX AND PICKING UP OCXIGON
Line_3755	UH EASE
Line_3756	ARCH THE AIR SAX OR EVOLI
Line_3757	JE THE UM ONE
Line_3758	THE CIRCULATORY IS
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE FULL CISTOM
Line_3761	ALL THE PLAINS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BIOSFEER THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BIOSFEER MAKING IT AN ENTIRE SYSTEM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CYSTUMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SORRY I'M ON THE WRONG UM T WEB SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE SELLS ARE BASED OR USED PARTICLES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT I'M NOT CAALLTIORN
Line_3768	MAY BE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOOD AND WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3770	SUN LIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FRTALLISER
Line_3771	DEFINITELY DEFINATELY DEFINITELY THAT'S PUT OUT ARROLA
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANTS ALSO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE E
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE FOTO CYNTHECIS TO GET THE I FROM I MEAN TO START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS YEAST OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SHELL
Line_3776	BUT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN SMELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY SELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG SELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE YEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE SOIL THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIONS OF SAL
Line_3779	IT'S UH BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN ENTIRE SISTOM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DIGUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	SELLS AND ORGANISMS AND SISTORMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SELLS AND ONE SISTM
Line_3784	PINK MUSCLES IN THE LEG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSCLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSCLE SELLS
Line_3786	THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS AND THE BRAIN ORGANIZED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AND THE EAST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE SE
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMULAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLY'S NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF SHELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SYSTOMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISMS AND SISTUMPS INSIDE OF OUR BODIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOOD THROUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONT ON THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMICK SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THE FOOD
Line_3793	TO DIGEST THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FOOD IT ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M VERY GOOD BUT YOU'VE JUST SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH BUT HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW A WET WET NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DIDN'T BREATHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DRIVE
Line_3797	I THINK JE THE DIEGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE A OLVIOLLAND YEAH THE LVIOLLEACH
Line_3799	GOOD AND NO MISS LIGHT HOW ARE YOU
Line_3800	I THINK IT'S TING THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS SO TWO AND O TWO O
Line_3802	RAY END BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3803	TS
Line_3804	I I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE AS TALKED YOU EARLIER
Line_3806	SMISTOMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I I THINK THAT IS A HEART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VEINS CONNECTED IN TO THE HEART
Line_3809	EACH TWO TO AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD CELLS ARE TRAVELLING THROUGH ARE THE VAINS AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN SEALS
Line_3811	THAT THE BLUE PART IS SMELL ARE SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAPOLLARY
Line_3812	IT'S LETTING IN BLOOD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLOOD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLOODS AROUND AND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BODY
Line_3814	BLOOD VESSUILS THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOOD AROUND
Line_3815	THE UM SLAD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE E
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASSES SO THAT WE CAN SURVIVE
Line_3819	UM THE LUNGS DEFINITELY THE LUNGS
Line_3820	E THE LUNGS
Line_3821	THROUGH END BEE THE MOUTH END THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE RETSREA
Line_3823	THE RATTLE SNAKES RATTL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORRIED WHEN HE SAW THE JUNE SPILL OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT USED THE QUITE FAST MAN
Line_3826	UM I I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SYSTOMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTICE SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WOUND FEET
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN TRIP OPEN HIS PREY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR ITS BLASTING A FART AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF GETS ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOOSE BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIOR
Line_3833	UM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WEATHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROUGH IT OR BEFORE
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURTS SO THEY JUST GOING TO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HURTS
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THEY'RE SPECIAL REFLEXES
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT COIN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEM THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT HAS SSTOMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AN IN ACTING OF MOVING POUCH TOGETHER MAKING A CAL
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POT THAT MOVEMENT WORKED TOGETHER
Line_3843	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS IN OUR ACTING POWERS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM
Line_3844	THE H OUT AND THE IES
Line_3845	THEY'RE IS MOVING OUTS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES THE ST
Line_3846	YES TO MOVE AND A WE'VE TOGETHER
Line_3847	IT IS I SEE WITH A MOUNTAIN LOOKING THINGY AND IT HAS FORCE STUMPS
Line_3848	IN SALT
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND ITALS
Line_3850	E GO SISTOM AND LIKE IT'S THE WIRES
Line_3851	THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR AMINALS AND THE AMINARS ARE E
Line_3852	THE EMINALS PROSSESS THROUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ARE PRODUCING A SUBSYSTEM OF THE OR
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STEMS
Line_3855	IS A SISTOM WITH INACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3856	IT IS A BUNCH OF IN OR ACTING POCHS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE IN OR ABOUT MOVING THE OTHERS
Line_3858	IS IT AS BUNCH OF SUP SISTOMS ARE A TON MAKE ONE
Line_3859	I THINK THAT THESE ARE SYPTITOMS SO
Line_3860	TICISCUMS BECAUSE IT'S THING AND REACTING ABOUT MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT'S WON'T YOU HA MG HORN A
Line_3862	OOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF A IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS HUM
Line_3866	IT'S BODY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSISTOM
Line_3868	THE HEART A CAN N AND A
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S MA BIGGER PART OF THOSE SUBSISTOM
Line_3870	THERE ARE
Line_3871	BIO SEERE IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN EGOCTISTOM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S LAND AND MOTION
Line_3874	THE ARROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE LIKE OR WHAT ENDS WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER I I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	ITS TOLD ME THAT IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NOW I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I I THINK THAT WARM PLACES WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE CIRFS
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE SCIRFICE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO STRING
Line_3882	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRFI AREA AFFECTS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE SCURFACE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED TO ME QUITE YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PENTTALS EVAPORATE QUITE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SOIL AND THE ROCKS OR A GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER ON THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GAS STAKE D
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP RICE WATER DROP LITS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THAN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITTING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER FIELD TO HELP US LIFT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	LEARNING YOU'VE ARADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	THAT'S SO CAN MARNEY
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEASEL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT HERE OR LATER THIS WERE
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY IT WEAR AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HI MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKES DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKET TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SCALE AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_3907	THE THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH IN THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SAL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CRECT
Line_3911	WELL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT H THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISK IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED AT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST MORE A GUESSED
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WELL BECAUSE UHM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST WANT US TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
Line_3916	OR MEASURING TAPE WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE IT WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AN AND IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH BRO HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE METRIC ISTOM
Line_3920	Y YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT A MIX- SURE IT'S RIGHT
Line_3922	H YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZES EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHING'S BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND CUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR HE WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTH WIDE IT'S GOING TO GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S I SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT UH I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE SEAL YEAH THE SCALE YEAH
Line_3927	NO I DIDN'T GET TO THAT I YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE COUNT HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM W THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WAIST THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	METAL METERS YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	NO- NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	YEAH THIS BONES OH SORRY
Line_3933	THAT WOULD BE FIVE E YEAH
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLA STICK WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	UH SORRY UHM
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	Y YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_3939	LEN GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I I WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT I THINK I SHOULD HEAR IT OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWER S
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY BLANK AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_3943	UH OH
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DEPTHS WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET T ALL
Line_3946	UM FOR BASICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRETTY USEFUL BUT THEY CAN'T BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING BECAUSE
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	N NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NOT
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T CLARMEN YET NO
Line_3952	OH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDENT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE IS A ONE
Line_3953	UH WE FLOWED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO REALLY Y
Line_3955	UH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER UM USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT YEAH
Line_3957	Y YEAH
Line_3958	UH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAT JE BEES OFF I'LL GET
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR HI YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH JUST THIRTY EIGHT PIECES WHEN I WALKED ET YEAH GO
Line_3962	YEAH I H WATER THE M I MAY HAVE IT IN ALL CLITTAL YA I NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO I DON'T REALLY KNOW MMM
Line_3965	TWENTY EIGHT LITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO CUP MAYBE JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO END AND THE OFF SO
Line_3967	EN YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBE CAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE A
Line_3969	I HAVE NO CLIPS FIN THAT'S MOSES YEAH
Line_3970	I THAT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS MOST ST
Line_3971	I IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRI OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
Line_3972	UM YEAS WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY GOT A LOT BETTER YEAH
Line_3973	UM I LEARN THAT U
Line_3974	YEAH REPEATING THINGS IT'S BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONCE AND I HEARD THAT ONE SHOW AS ALWAYS MISSED OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES ON B
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WAY OR GUESS
Line_3977	UH GRAMS ABOUT AS MUCH AS A PAPER CLIPS
Line_3978	AND BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO EL GRAMS AND HE THOUGHT THAT E IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM UH A GRAM IS JUST ABOUT A WHEN CLOSED OR PAPER CLIP
Line_3980	THUS TO WEIGH AS MONTH THAT WEAR
Line_3981	UH YEAH AH THOUSAND S
Line_3982	A MILE GRAM WITH HERE'S THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGHS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	M EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BE UH ONE LINE
Line_3984	UH THE MAKE THE SINK THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM USE THE BALANCE WOULD BE SCRAPED IT WOULDN'T BE SO IT'S SLANTED
Line_3986	OKAY BUT I WANT TO SEE THE INTERACTIVE CHIP
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORIENT WEIGHED MORE
Line_3988	WE A WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM SEE ACTUALLY SURE FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED BANDS EQUALS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE THAT ONE OF THE BEADS EQUALS A GRAM
Line_3992	I THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
Line_3994	A HUNDRED GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM S SEEDS
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP UM ONE SIDE WAS S UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TO I LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	USE THE NURACTIVE CLIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSES
Line_4000	AND WE DID WEIGH WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	HI MY THAT THING IS GOING UH IT LIGHTS AND GOES UP
Line_4002	M READING RITING AND MASS MAINLY
Line_4003	LOOKS HE UH FLASH IS RED
Line_4004	MMM WELL YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DISK WITH THE SCRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING ON MINE BATS
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE DUST WITH THREE BY TWO MINE WAS TWENTY NINE TENTH BITE TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DISK SEEM TORN IN ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSE TO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NINE TENTHS A I MEAN TWO OR NINE TENTHS IS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE PARENT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	M HENCE OKAY
Line_4011	TRY STING NO OH YEAH WE DID WE HAD I'M GONNA LOW THIS UP THAT'S YOU M
Line_4012	UM A METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR NAMED IS THEY ARE
Line_4013	NO THE IT IT ISN'T COLOR IT IT ALL
Line_4014	YOU YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I I'VE NO IDEA WE MIGHT COLLAR IT SOMETIME
Line_4015	THOSE THINGS MARKED A CENTIMETERS SALT OKAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDREDTH OR METER IT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER UM ALL THE WAY I DON'T LIKE I
Line_4017	NO WE'VE JUST START WE'VE JUST STARTED CUTTING IT OUT BEING DELUDE TOGETHER
Line_4018	OH ONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALS ONE TEN HE SAID TO BE A
Line_4019	AND THAT'S W THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTUITA ONE TWO THREE FOR SIX HEY NINE TEN THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER'S
Line_4021	WHAT IS SCALE ONE MILLIMETERS
Line_4022	KAY U UP FOUR
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE'S I DON'T WANT TO GET RED OFF
Line_4024	OKAY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT'S I
Line_4025	I KNOW BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FORE I SAY THOSE
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LITER'S NOW CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPARE VIALS HE AH AH THAT'S LIKE WHAT ARMS WE'RE
Line_4029	UM A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUALED TO ONE LITER AND THAT
Line_4030	NOT I I KNOW LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT HE WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I CHAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	U MEDIAN L THEY SUCH THING AS A KILLLIDER I THINK
Line_4032	UH LOT OF WATER UH
Line_4033	NAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UH YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UH A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GRAM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLILITER TRAVELS EQUALS A MILL A MILLIMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD FIND THE CUPS THAT LOOKED LIKE AND YOU WOULD PURE IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	UH I WANNA DO GRASURATERS YEAH
Line_4040	YEAH YOU COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS UP
Line_4041	WELL THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	I THINK THIS IS ON BACKWARDS THAT'S WHY IT IT'D FALLING OFF
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DEN IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET THE TEETH HAS ONLY SHOWN US WE DID THE VIAL THING AND THEN THE TEETH HAS ALSO SHOWED US BUT
Line_4046	UH CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE IN THE IN THE THING ABOUT A
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF VIALS AND SOME PEOPLE'S SIDE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LETTERS OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WIDTH OR HEIGHTS
Line_4052	MMM E YOU SAY I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION ER THINK YOU MIGHT THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT- THE AMOUNT OF THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT THE IT'S A HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND LENGTH
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE US HURRY COLD NO NOT THAT ONE WHAT DID WE DO THIS OR
Line_4056	THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSANDTH OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OR
Line_4057	W ISN'T A OH TEN
Line_4058	THAT YOU ARE UM PROPERLY THE EITHER THE THIS ONE OF THE ONES
Line_4059	WAY I WOULD UM MEAN THEY ARE PROBABLY THE HUNDREDS
Line_4060	M WHAT'S YOU IN IT IN YEAH YEAH UM L WU DID ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	HM UH MOTOR LIVED WHITE WHAT ACHING WHAT WE S LIKE TO WHAT WE YOU SHAD AS
Line_4062	UM TRAP ALLY MILLA LITERS
Line_4063	OH BUT I WANT TO SEE THE FIRST TIME ONE I DON'T FORGET THE
Line_4064	NO WE WEREN'T USING VIALS WE USED VILE A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH UH WELL OH WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME S
Line_4066	MMM NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE A D LINE A SEE LINE A D LINE
Line_4067	OF THE SYRINGE IS A THING IT SO IT SUCK UP WATER AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THEY ARE THAT YOU'VE SUCKED UP
Line_4068	E WELL BYE THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	Y YEAH IT'S NO
Line_4070	Y YEAH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BREAK
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE PILES WERE DIFFERENT O YEAH MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADUATED SO AND THERE IS BUT THOSE ONES HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER UH
Line_4074	UM MMM HOW MANY OH THAT'S A SO THAT BIG THING AND A ONE LITER
Line_4075	O IT'S THE SO IT CAN THE INTERACTIVE SODA CAN I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES NO
Line_4076	NO BUT WO A HUNDRED NOLLY THAT LOOKS NEAT IF CLOSE
Line_4077	TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADUATED SILINDERS EQUALLY WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT BES A COLD IS WHAT IT'S WONDERING OH A TRAY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONE'S WIDE IF YOU FLAT IN THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT T
Line_4080	UM S WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL UM THE ELS TOWN STANDS FOR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER IN TWENTY IF IT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_4082	YOU WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU'LL LOOK AT WHERE THE WATERS LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LOW ENOUGH TO THE R
Line_4083	AM YEAH
Line_4084	UM UM I HUH NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WON'T NO LOOK AT THAT END THAT SAIL MAN OR ACTIVE SAINT THAT WON'T
Line_4086	SEAL LAND TRACT LONET
Line_4087	M IT'S INTERACTIVE END SODA HUH EXLY S ANE SODA
Line_4088	MMM BUT I WANT A RATE AT MY CONSOLS
Line_4089	DON'T FEEL SALT UH NO BONES
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WEIGHT NOT WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
Line_4091	Y YEAH
Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND SAID TO A CARPENTER
Line_4093	UH I WANT I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED OUT A GROCERY STORE AND SAID YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIPS S
Line_4095	U APPLES PROBABLY HE NEW PROBABLY WHITER I USED SMALL AND HE COULD E USED BIG
Line_4096	HOUNDS' AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	SO T SAY ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTED ONE POUND THE SOME THING
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED A THE UHM UNIT ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UH
Line_4100	AND H PLASTIC TIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	AREN'T AREN'T GOOD TO USE SURE MEASURE I MEAN WEIGHT
Line_4102	IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER WIPE BECAUSE SHE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
Line_4104	USED THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	MY ONE WOULD BE SMALL AND ONE WOULD BE HUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND GROUP WOULD BE T
Line_4107	WITH THE RULERS TAPE MEASURE
Line_4108	WE MOST REEL MOSTRELLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	H SAME LENGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A ROLLER WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURE BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULDN'T USE MET M METERS
Line_4112	I NOTICE A HUNDRED A HUNDRED OF A CENTRIMETERS
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_4114	MY DAD MEASURES WIT UM BILDS BUILDING SO HE USES A LOT OF THI STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL A METER AND ST IF LIKE A A LOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE SERIAL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TIL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD BE WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE THE TAPE
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD UH MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	OK THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_4121	LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURE IT MEASURES NOT IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPUTERS A DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOORS ARE UH CAN BE
Line_4126	WIGHTER THAN TAPE THAN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UM RULERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WAMBLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE IT THE CORRECT WAY
Line_4131	SO A IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METER'S SO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT IT
Line_4134	I I COULD
Line_4135	Y YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN UM MILLIMETERS IN A CENTIMETERS
Line_4137	I DON'T AW I DON'T
Line_4138	NO MARELLEY NOT TOO MUCH
Line_4139	SPONGES SPONGES THEY SOAK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEAN STUFF H
Line_4140	GRAMS ARE A MEASURING TOOLS
Line_4141	AND THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURE OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU LOOKING FOR UNTIL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED
Line_4143	SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN IT'S LIKE THIS AND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRETTY BOUNCE RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU YOU YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COUNT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPONGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPONGE YOU WAIT UNTILL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MESSY PUT THE FAN IN
Line_4147	UM HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT A DRY SPUNGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THE PUT THE GRAMS IN ONE BY ONE AGAIN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TWO IF IT'S LIKE AN HEAVY IT UM YOU CAN GO BY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TOO HEAVY ONE YOU PUT IN ANOTHER FIVE YOU'D TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOUR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	UM THE DRY SPONGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN ALLY REMEMBER
Line_4153	UM THE E
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHT'S
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGHS TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	WHEN THE END THE DRY SPONGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	MMM IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UNEVENLOY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIG SINGS WOULD HUN MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT STRIVE
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY UH HUH
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT A
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WET IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG AND SOAKED IT'S GOING TO BE JIGANTIC MMM
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANT NO GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	UH I HAVE NO IDEA WELL YEAH HAVE TO IDEA
Line_4166	THEN UM TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN AN ORANGE
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAYBE TOO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH I MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILO
Line_4169	HH-MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSAL I WOULD LOSE A
Line_4171	MILLI I THINK THERE'S THESE THINGS CALLED MILLIGRAMS I CAN REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILIGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WE USE METERS IT'S LAKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LEAKS FROM
Line_4175	TEXIS FROM HERE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKES THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER ALONG WHICH IS IMOSING YEAH A
Line_4177	DRY SPONGE MMM
Line_4178	H AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESSING
Line_4179	NO REALLY YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
Line_4180	A HUNDRED THOUSAND UM H WASH
Line_4181	TESTING TESTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER AS SPUNGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	UH I CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WELL HUH
Line_4185	LEVELS MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BAR IS LINED UP WITH THIS THE
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMPTY WATER BUBBLE OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	IF DON'T PUT ANOTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE IMFINATELY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IN IT
Line_4190	UM IT THE THE F FIVE GRAMS TURNED INTO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER AND THE SPONGE
Line_4192	UHM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCKETS
Line_4193	I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU COULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	A KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBE LEPTUP COMPUTER A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTY UM WEIGH THAT SOUNDS SIXTY ACIDS A POUND
Line_4198	THEN MY DAD FLOW MY HOME HE EH HE USED TO HAVE A JOB IN CALIFORNIA

Line_4202	UM USING SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFIC LIKE U
Line_4203	NO WE WE HAD TWENTY FIVE IN OUR GRADUATED SYLUNDER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED AND THE CONTAINER
Line_4204	UM WELL
Line_4205	WELL I CAN REALLY TELL DIFFERENT
Line_4206	WELL YEAH WHAT YOU SHOULD WAS WHAT HOMENED I JUST CAN'T REPEAT IT AL
Line_4207	THIS UM OUR CONTAINER DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ONE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED STUFF LIKE WHAT
Line_4208	YEH SAME YEAR EQUAL IT TH THOSE
Line_4209	IT HAD TO BE ER YEAH
Line_4210	UM I PARTY MUCH NO
Line_4211	UM I WE IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAM LOSE THAT'S H
Line_4212	YEAH WE DID IT WITH PAPER CLIPS I REMEMBER US
Line_4213	SO WHITERINT HAYES

Line_4254	UH IS IT IRON
Line_4255	WELL UM SODA CANS ARE IN FILLED ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE TOW
Line_4256	CAPACITY VOLUME BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY FILLED TO THE TUFF
Line_4257	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT
Line_4258	H UH NO
Line_4259	NO WE PUT HIM IN THIS TALL CAN AND THEN WE MEASURED IT
Line_4260	THEN WE POURED IT IN INTO THE INTO THE SODA C
Line_4261	IN IN SO CA
Line_4262	MINILITORS ARE T
Line_4263	WELL A LITER IS BIGGER THAN A MILLA LITER WELL IT'S MILLILITER IS
Line_4264	DIDN'T TALK WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT WE MIX
Line_4265	A LITER IS A UM TWO A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MIL MILLILITERS
Line_4266	UH WE USED GRAMS

Line_4289	ONE NO CASE OR WHAT ELSE IS THERE
Line_4290	I UH HUH I LIKE LOOKING AT THE MILLAMETERS
Line_4291	UH I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCE I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METERS STICK I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METERS STICK
Line_4292	OH IT'S THREE METERS LONG BUT ACTUALLY REM
Line_4293	UM TEN CENT IT'S METERS HEIGHT CARRY METERS METERS N OH NO
Line_4294	I KNOW BUT THIS BUT MY ARM SPAN WAS WAS WAS ACTUALLY LONGER THAN HOW TALL I WAS AND IT WAS MORE THAN A METER
Line_4295	M UH AH NOT USUALLY SOME OF THEM
Line_4296	I I WANT A LOOK AT THE R GROUPS ME TWENTY GROUPS STRAWS
Line_4297	THAT THAT THE STRIVE'S ARE NOT GOOD
Line_4298	YEAH BUT I WANNA GO INTO MORE STUFF ON A UM I WANT THEM
Line_4299	PACES IT'S WHAT WE DID A METER TAPE S IT MOVES
Line_4300	I WANT TO SEE THE OTHER METER S STICK
Line_4301	METER'S STICK METERS STICK ONE AND METERS STICK TWO WHAT'S METERS SKIP
Line_4302	OKAY NO BUT I I WON'T LIKE A THE ESTIMETOR'S STICK
Line_4303	A KIN I WE KNOW THERE'S HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM A
Line_4304	ONE CENTIMETER I WAYS MIXED YEA
Line_4305	TEN AND THERE'S TEN DECIMETERS AND ONE
Line_4306	THERE'S IS THERE MANY KILOMETERS
Line_4307	AND OTHERS ON LIKE CLICK ON SCAILS
Line_4308	MEASURING LONG DISTANCES LIKE THE SCHWOEL TO THE HOUSE
Line_4309	MAYBE I WOULD USE MILLIRITER BECAUSE REA
Line_4310	WE DID THAT WHEN I WANTED YOU METER CHALK OR WE HASN'T DONE THAT ONCE YET
Line_4311	THREE THE IN HALF FORE MMM YES FORE METERS
Line_4312	YEAH OR INEVITUS TAPE MADE TENCILS AGAIN

Line_4432	THAT AMERICA HAS D ALL NAME LIE THAT DOESN'T USE THE ELECTRIC CISTOM
Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T CAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THEY E IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT UH NOT ALL STRAWS OR THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	WERE THE SOME OF THEM WERE SNULAR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE CUT IT OUT TH WE COULD WELL UM ONCE WE CUT IT OUT THE METER TIPES WE
Line_4440	UM THAT I IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH WE UM NOW WE
Line_4442	MEASURED UH THE BOOK SHELLS
Line_4443	BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE CLOSER THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO R

Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS B
Line_4451	IT'S WORKS NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STANDARD THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT IF EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAM S
Line_4455	LIKE I SAID THESE WERE LIKE THE CUBES THE ONE AND THE FIVE T
Line_4456	UM IT'S DIVIDED BY IT
Line_4457	EL YES THE THE CHIP
Line_4458	YES DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE RESULTS WERE UH NIAS
Line_4459	YEAH BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOMETIMES
Line_4461	IT UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CUBE BLUE JUST USED PAPER CLIPS INSTEAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN P
Line_4463	WE WE TRIED TO GET WITH OUR EH GRAMS WE TRIED TO GET
Line_4464	IN INSTEAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL OF THOSE BULS WE COULD JUST USE
Line_4465	THE THAT TEN A
Line_4466	THAT TEN AND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE CHOCKS THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	HUH KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TERMS DOING IT SO IT TOOK LONGER AND SO JUST ONE PERSON

Line_4479	YEAH STUFF THAT LAS YEAH
Line_4480	UM THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN ENDED AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN S
Line_4481	UM WELL I MEAN
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT IT'S LIKE WIBBLEWAPY
Line_4484	WELL A WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE YEAH BIG WHEN IT CALLED A GRAM
Line_4486	WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT
Line_4487	Y YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH FIRST I HOLD IN MY HAND AND I WEAY IT AND THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USES
Line_4490	HER AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL NO
Line_4491	YEAH YEAH UH-HUH YEAH
Line_4492	UM I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT I
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WEIGH NOT ALL THE WEIGHT

Line_4495	YEAH ONE MILLION
Line_4496	UM ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE SO IT JUST FLIPPED UP UM
Line_4498	I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S TRYING TO CHICK US BUT YOU JUST DID THAT YOU'RARITY DID THAT
Line_4499	H OH WELL THEN POUBBLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
Line_4500	THAT'S THAT'S UM I
Line_4501	THE LIONS WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FOIL IT WOULD BE
Line_4502	YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAY S
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THEN IF YOU USED THE SAME SIZE EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE'S WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY A YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND PLASTIC CHIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCALE THING WE HAD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AND IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LIKE OUR EVEN TO
Line_4507	IT UM THERE IS MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THEN IT WOULD S
Line_4508	COPY UM
Line_4509	TOOKS AWAY A LITTLE TWO
Line_4510	YEAH AND
Line_4511	TAKE OUT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A HUMAN GRAMS AND THEN WILL GO BUT IT'S FLOAT IT'S FLOTING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND HUH
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WE EVEN USED GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW W IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CRUST AND GO OSSOM
Line_4516	HO OKAY BYE BYE
Line_4517	UH YEAH
Line_4518	HI UH-HUH
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOAKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHED IT PUT ANOTHER PUT THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPONGE STICK DID NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	THEN WE GOT WA SOAKED UP ALL THIS WATER AS IT COULD THEN WE WAITED AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH YEAH S
Line_4525	S SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_4526	TO CLEAN BECAUSE IF SHOWS WET AND WITH DIRTY WATER IT WOULD ABSORBED THE DIRTY WATER M
Line_4527	NO DIDN'T I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMTY CAUSE CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
Line_4530	IT HOLD COOL IS YOU ALWAYS UP TO TOP WITH THAT EVEN TOP THUS PRE
Line_4531	KILOGRAMS THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND ER KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDRED UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE A HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO A KILOGRAM IS PROLLY GENNIBY IS HEAVY IS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS OR TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT ONE WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THIS STOVE HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	TER IS PICTURES AS HEAVY AS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILICRUM PLUS ONE L UH WATER LITER
Line_4541	YEAH MISS MISS STEAL THE FINE PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPONGE WE UM MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WEIGHT SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPUNGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	IT'S A FIVE AND THEN NECTAR ONE THEN
Line_4546	IT WAY INSTEAD OF OWAYS HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THEY CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALLED OUT SO FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS YOU CAN T AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THAT SHOULD BE SIXTEEN TO MAKE IT WAY SO THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S A RO LOCK UH LOCKET INSIDE OF HIM
Line_4551	AND YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
Line_4552	U AND THEY'RE IN THE SPONGE YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER BE WATERS HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY ARE LOCK ALL THE ROCK IT'S GOING ALL AWAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	WE HAVEN'T IF YOU ACTUALLY WAIT BUT AS IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	OKAY SO YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO HERE
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT NO WITH NO WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCALE AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUITS YOUR VEGETABLES AND A
Line_4559	PUT THE SCALE IN A WAY
Line_4560	YOU HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT F
Line_4561	CISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DO SAYING THING A HOW THE CISTOM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A CYSSTANT BECAUSE THE PREPELLAR IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	HI THING IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN THEY HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK
Line_4565	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROKE GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BAKE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OF
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING E AND SEEING HOW FIRE IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IN MIX A FILPERSISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU KNOW ONE ABOUND IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE IT SICK AND BREAK
Line_4571	AND I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAY BE
Line_4572	U S A HEAVIER BULB BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE IT YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE CLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LITTLE THE LOCK CAN GOE BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOATS
Line_4577	UM GOE TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PIGNECK IN THE
Line_4578	WEN
Line_4579	YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIVE BOLTS YOU CAN BILLY THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I BUILT MINE OUT UH PA OUT OF PAPER CLIPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WASHERS
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BULB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS AND IN THE LITTLE BOOK
Line_4583	WAY IT THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES BECAUSE THEY CUT IT THE SHORTER OR LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND SEE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SURE THIS ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIR PLAING COULD FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIR PLAIN FLY
Line_4588	I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FING YOUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4589	I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GOING TO GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
Line_4590	BY IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PARPELLEAR IS THE STRING IS MICKING IT BALANCE AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE PEOPLE A KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PREPELLAR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4593	O CASE ON HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RUN THE WATER IT'S LIKE E TO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONE SETTING UP THE MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
Line_4597	WELL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNEY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE EXACISIS THE PENDULUM LENGTH JUST THE PENDULUM LIKE AN NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRA FER PRODICTING THAT'S FOR TEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETER S SWING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST UH YOU COULD TEST YOUR PRODICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THE PENDULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GET S LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PENDULUMS AND LOTS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHECK A PENNY AT THE BILLY AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDAML YOUR BOUT WILL TIP OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE ABOUT S COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHERS CAN END THE FOR N A COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
Line_4609	HOW THE PENNIES WERE STACKED I WOULD SAY A WOULD STACKED REALLY SLUFTHILY AND D WAS STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE GETS DOWN MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YES
Line_4612	I I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
Line_4613	UH CLEAR AND UM YEAH
Line_4614	AND ON WE ALSO MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCE S WAS
Line_4615	I THINK F
Line_4616	THE UM THE METERS STICK HUTCH IS STANDING UP AND AND I
Line_4617	THE I DUM AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S SLAPPING
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE ONE IS POUNSING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS A BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND ONTO THE GROUND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKING HAIR PLANS AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HEY J GRASS ABOUT PENDULUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PENDULUM HA IS FIFTY
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LEFT SIDE UM
Line_4625	IT'S AND NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT'S HOW MANY SWEENS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF SWAINGE AND THE PEN TO ON A LEN INTO IS
Line_4628	WELL WE E WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKING THE PLAN BUT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	THES THEY EAR PLAIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WE'RE MAKING HIND SOME BOATS
Line_4630	W WE HAD UM THAT
Line_4631	A LIKE PADDLE THING FOR THE WEN SINGS OR THE FRONT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN AND SOON UP THE LINE
Line_4633	YOU HAVEN'T TRIED THE PLAINS YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE A I TRIED IT YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THINK YOU ARE ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANYTHING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I KNOW I I I CAN REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MIND BUT I I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS A YUM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRAFT WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TASK YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF RUN YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WHAT I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE LINE WOULD BE- UM I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	HUH IT'S GOING ALL YOU A
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARK THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURE IT I I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM LENGTH MAYBE MARKED IN HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	UM THE NUMBERS ARE LIGHTER THERE AND UM THE NAME WHERE IT IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THE THE BOTTOM THAT OR THE HIGHEST SO
Line_4646	UH GULLYEN AWHILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING VARIETY WELL THINGS
Line_4648	HIS UM STRADDY LEARNING ABOUT CATAPULTS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT AN
Line_4650	AD IT A P CICL ST AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THERE
Line_4651	THEM THINK YOU I SEE THAT POPSICLE STICK THAT THINK YOU PUT ON A CHUMMTHEM
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORK YOU END THE ROBBER THE RIBET STOPPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT HOW UM THAT LOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA JUMP BILLY FART
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES FLING UP LIKE STICK
Line_4655	UM JU I THINK IT'S
Line_4656	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOATS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FLOW AS THEY'RE OTHER OR THEY'LL UM DOWN
Line_4658	TO FLOW IT ON WIRE AND UM PEOPLE TOO GET ON THEM AND SEE THAT OTION
Line_4659	SISERS UM WATER AND UM THAT'S A
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD CAR
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UHM PEOPLE
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD IF THEY INTEL IT COUNTS IT
Line_4663	I I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION RARELY WELL
Line_4664	OUT OF PENNIES UM THERE'S SOME PENNIES IN THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWING IN WATER
Line_4665	THEORY MEAN OF LIKE THE PENNIES BEING PASCAENGERS
Line_4666	I LIKE REMIND ABOUT HOW MANY PENNIES WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT EX STINK
Line_4667	THE IT CLOWS UP IT IT STINKS FASTER BECAUSE UM
Line_4668	CAUSE UM IT HAS MY WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM IT
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHT A M
Line_4670	HOW CAN U UM CASE LESS IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM PTRIC ONES CARRY MORE BECAUSE IT CAUSE IT'S A TALLER
Line_4671	THE T ONE CA CAN CARRY MORE C A AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CAT CASE THAT CAN SMALLER
Line_4672	WE COULD SHORTEN AND OUT AND IT COULD UM
Line_4673	THINK IT'S FISH IT'S FISH LIKE THAT CAN LIKE THE KIND OF STRING YOU USED TO CATCH FISH
Line_4674	IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A STRING IT COULDN'T LE CAUSE IT'S CHAIN TO FIT IT
Line_4675	I DIDN'T REALLY HARD YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON UM THE STRANGE YOU WOULD IT TO A CHAIR THEN PUT THE AIR PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ONE IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_4677	IT GRIPS IT MORE AIR SIDE YOU CAN SO YOU CAN THEY CAN FLOW FASTER
Line_4678	WITHOUT THE PREPARLAR I WOULDN'T FLIGHT BECAUSE YOU ANY UNIT N AND THE RUBBERBAND WOULD HAVE NO WHERE TO UM TO
Line_4679	S ORAN THE COMPUTER NIPPED IT ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVES
Line_4680	MAKE THE BRAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF ELEPPARPAL AND TO BE AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THERE ARE TWO AIR PLAINS AND THERE ON A STRING
Line_4683	ONES IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S KIND OF GOING DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER THE THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN CAUSE IT'S GONNA A NEED TO WEIGH MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RIVER BANDS UM SWINGS LIKE TURNS AROUND UM THE PERPELLAR IS GOING SO I CAN'T GET MOREAIR
Line_4686	THEY ARE TO A AND A PLAIN UM THE CANDLE
Line_4687	MAKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS ALIKE HANGING AROUND LIKE THAT TIGHT
Line_4688	THIS SCRAP IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SILENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF IT WAS GRAPHING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULD
Line_4690	REPTILES A MAR NOT WELL IN
Line_4691	IT WAS ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR THE R THE COURT WOULD GO
Line_4692	I THOUGHT I NEVER
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PEN SLEPT
Line_4694	IT MAN ABOUT HOW YOU HA CHE THAN TILL IT FILLS IT FASTER SLOWER EX
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENDULUMS AND HOW THEY SWING AND
Line_4696	THE GRAPH IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USED ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ARE Y SWAY OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PREDICTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL AN VERY THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN I WILL
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE FLAG THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
Line_4701	RIVER BAND IN IT JUST THE PREPELLAR BEAR LEAVE AND SPIN WHENEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A DRAFT WITH AN EX AND WE AXIS S
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EX AXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE WERE AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU WOULD GATHERED UH IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND SO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS OR THE MOTORS
Line_4711	BY AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONES AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS I
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW'D I EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRANDFATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE PIPE THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES UH ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECOND GOES AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS THE SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSIT SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT SLOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MADE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLER PLAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEY'RE KIN LIKE CATAPULTS YOU PUSH DOWN
Line_4724	MS THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKES YOU ABLE TO SHOOT
Line_4726	NOT NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	WHAT I THINK IS THE HIGHER THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOOT
Line_4728	IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIKER THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE S STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WAYS SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRETTY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPPER BASE IS WHERE YOU PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK IT PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STICKS ARE EACH CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM S
Line_4733	IN RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIGHER OR TO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPER BRACE WITH SHOOTING FLIPPER BRACE WITH SHOOTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON A PLASTIC ANGLED HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HI IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS I
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICKS IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONES WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONES WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN SETTING PENDULUMS AND TODAY WE DID HELP DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BE BECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A LOT CH LOT SHORTER STRINGS
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	T THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING IN HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS
Line_4749	THEY KEEP I'M KIND OF LIKE ON A GRANDFATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED A YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'L'D SINK THE BOAT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TINY T OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFEBOATS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	OU RETY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIMES
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE IT WASN'T THERE ON THIRSDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TOO HARD IT MIGHT SINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK EARLIER THEN USIUAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAIN S
Line_4763	THE HIGHER THE CAPACITY OF THE BOATS
Line_4764	THE HIGHER OR THE MORE PASANGERS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAPHED ABOUT THE M
Line_4766	THE Y LINE WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE EX LINE WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASSANGERES THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PATANGERS IT COULD HOLD
Line_4769	EX IS THE COMPACITY OF THE BOAT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THEY
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENT Y FI IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PASSENGERS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANY ONCE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	HERE IS A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND THE PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWANGN FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT CAN GO A UH THIS MORE TIMES TWO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPERCLIP THE PENNY AND THE PENCIL
Line_4779	UH THE STIRRING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THEY ALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	H HOW FAST THE PENNIES GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE FASTER IT'LL SWING SIDEWAYS
Line_4783	STUDYING UH THEY WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWING IT SIDEWAYS
Line_4785	THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	UH CHANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE HUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND THE SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES YOU COULD SWING BACK IN FORTH FIFTY AND FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	O UH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UM IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT WOULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE I DID AT THE LAST STARTING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATAPULTS
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPPER BRACE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE CLICK GOES AFTER YOU LOUNCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CORK UH LIKE SLID
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LAUNCHED THE CLORK
Line_4801	Y YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP THE FIRST STICK
Line_4802	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CORK WAS LANCHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN MATCH THE CORK
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LAUNCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO FARTHER
Line_4805	I NOTICED THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT FURTHER BECAUSE THE CORKS WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WAIT OF THE CLOURAK MAKES THEM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENDULUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PENNY IN THE IT MAKES THE PENNY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S DRAFT TO SEE HOW LONG THE PENDULUM'S
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM THE BIGGEST TO A LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE AN ESTIMATE T YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SUBTRACTING N
Line_4815	IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS GETTING LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH I I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND IT'LL STILL BE THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULD SEE YOURS RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID STUFF ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UM I DON'T REM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UH PENNIES ARE LIKE PASTANGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL UH IF THERE IS MORE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE AND THAN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
Line_4825	SOMEONE'S DROPPING MORE PENNIES IN TO THE BOLT
Line_4826	MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED IN THE BO
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING ME A GRAFF ABOUT UH BOTS
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THEN THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGED A BUNCH OF THINGS IT
Line_4831	IT IT WOULD LIKE SINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PAANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4834	I FIGURED OUT THAT UM THE BIGGER THE LIFE BOAT THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOAT IS S
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PENNIES LIKE RE FITTING IN EACH BOAT
Line_4837	AY IS THE BIGGEST SO IT'LL HOLD MORE PASSENGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PENNIES IT CAN MAY BE HOLD MORE PASSENGERS S
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY UH OF THE BOB WHICH IS NOT
Line_4840	UH WELL THEY SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST SLITEST OR LITEST LEAST TO GREATEST
Line_4841	WE'LL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THAT THAT THE NUMBER C IS RISING UP
Line_4843	THE EXACT SEYS IS THE WHY THE CAPACITY MILLIMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PASCANERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EX AXES IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE Y AXES IS ON SO TO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WIDE ACCESS SHOWS HOW MANY PASSENGERS THERE ARE E
Line_4847	THE GUY AXES IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ONE EVERY BOAT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALLER PENNIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOAT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4850	I NOTICED THAT THE THE NUMBER OF THE COMPASS THE PASSANGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GROW
Line_4851	IT EITHER GOT THE PASSENGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT T SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH TWO THE DIFFERENCES AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOTORS A RIVER BANDS AND WHY IS A DISTANCE
Line_4854	BANDS IT I'LL GO PRETTY FAR
Line_4855	WERLL'S PLACED LIKE ON THEIR SIDE IT WILL BE EASIER AND OLDEST
Line_4856	WELL YOU PLEASE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE RED THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE GOING THERE SO YOU IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RIB ER BANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASSENGERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSAUNGERS THE DISTANCE WILL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FEW DAYS AGO WE THE PAPER AIRS PLAINS
Line_4860	UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PEN
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME I YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4863	INCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A A PENNY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF IT SHORTER IT WILL FILL FAT S SLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY VARIABLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CHANGE A TOO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AFTER TIME
Line_4869	THE SHORTER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT S IT TAKES
Line_4870	AS THE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT HAS
Line_4871	UM LET'S SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRANING IS ER THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PREDICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND THE ACHE OF THE SLIPPER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH OF WHAT WE DID SO FAR AND WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MORON
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOING TO PUT CORK AND THEN OR LAUNCH AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR IT WILL GO
Line_4876	THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PERPUS THE CORK IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH AND THEN THE RIVER STOPPER HELPS UM STAY UP AND THEN
Line_4877	I I'M NOT SURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE FLIPPER BRACE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RIVER STOP
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A PICTURE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4880	YE AT THE WEIGHT MAY UM AFFECT HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4881	YEAH WELL PAPER YOU TRY OUT AND NOT MUCH THOSE TO MOROW
Line_4882	OR WEHELB WE MAKE EITHER OUR GRASS OR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKES A CHART
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER AN IT CAN FIT BEFORE IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO A MIXTURE THERE IS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
Line_4886	HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOB WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOME IT MIGHT HA BABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UN LET'S SEE UH
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND OF JUST DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT MAKE IT SINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SENSE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM ON EVERYWHERE THEY'LL SINK FASTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS T
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEN NOT AS TALLER AND IT WILL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONCE THE BOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BUILT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOOT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE THAT THING MAKE IT WORSE OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY UH
Line_4897	CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T KNOW IF ONE OTHER KIND WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU'D
Line_4899	NO IF THEY ARE WRONG OR BRIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK HIM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO SINK IF YOU STUCK HIM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD UM
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACORN MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EACH CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG A STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S POST TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	F I S UH I
Line_4905	THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE M
Line_4906	WE MADE FOUR PAPER PULLS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND THEN HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	US WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4908	TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM BANO
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLDS MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLDS MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL ABOUT HIS
Line_4913	OT DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SETTLE IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT EM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE LE SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER'S TOO RUFF THE BOAT CAN TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN IT WELL STAY UP
Line_4917	THE THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER WAS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE UM A SMALLER OR BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
Line_4919	THAT UM WE C
Line_4920	ACTITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PACANGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRASS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE WOULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING OUR IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT AMOUNT ON THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4926	IT'S CAPACITIES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT WOULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND A
Line_4929	THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS
Line_4930	THAT IT AND THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSANGERS
Line_4931	HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT GETS AN MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	UH I SO HU S
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS A CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW IT COULD WHEN WE'VE BEEN T HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PREPELLAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS A PROPELLER UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODDY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLOAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIN THE STRING YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU WINED UP THE PERPELLER
Line_4938	WELL MEAN MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING AT THE ANG ON WE LEARN THAT IF YOU PUT IT IN AN ANGLE IT
Line_4939	IT FACTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLY
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TWO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOR SIX WAIT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE FIBER IT OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS IT HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GO SLOWER AND I WILL GO AS FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WINDS IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL THE MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER A A DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT AFFECTED HOW M THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGE IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF IT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKES IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE ER
Line_4949	ELL IT LIKE Y YOU TAKE OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS AND MIGHT EFFECT THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPERCLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I I NOTICE THAT WITH ONCE AGAIN WITH
Line_4952	MORE WITH MORE PAS AS YOU ADD MORE PASSANGERS THE LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROABBLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR AROUND THAT
Line_4954	THEN NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RIPPER BANDS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PACE ER AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID IN MY IM
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS UHM TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE I SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DISH AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP O THE DESK AND THEN JUST LET GO OF THEM AND COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE S SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE ROOT OH YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THE M
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I THINK SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	LAND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_4968	THE FLIPPOSTIC CRANES ARE
Line_4969	IT SHOWS HOW MANY CENTS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENT AMIS
Line_4970	I SEE WHEN I UM CLECK IT'S GOING THROUGH THE
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE OFF THINGS WITH THE EXPERIMENT IN MASS WHETHER IT IS
Line_4972	WARMTH YEAH TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE A OF THINGS ILL THE EXPITILIMENT MIGHT BE LONG AND YOU'RE NOT SHOW IF THAT'S RIGHT OR
Line_4974	IT EFFECTS THE WILL DISSULTS BECAUSE YEAH YEAH
Line_4975	IT'S A GRAPH SHOW
Line_4976	IT'S COUNTING BY TENS AND IT'S MOVING UP BY CENTRIMETAS
Line_4977	IT'S GAIN HIT AND HIT S
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTERED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE STRING
Line_4980	S SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WE UM MEASURE IT AND UM I
Line_4983	ON MEASURING TO
Line_4984	WE KEPT THE PENNY AND THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE LU THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE OTION AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSENGERS AND SOMETIMES I MERGENCY LUGGAGE
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DREW ACROSS
Line_4987	WE BUILT THEM OUT OF A PAPER CUP CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANT SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZE I
Line_4990	S SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PENNIES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIDE THE PLACE MEANS OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I FIGURES UM I DON'T KNOW ALL VARIABLES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOATS WERE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WEIGHT
Line_5000	WE DID BY US DOING EVERY THING AND EVERYBODY MAKING THEIR BOATS PRETTY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME E
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE Y AXIS IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERERS TO THE BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY A FAR COAL LINE
Line_5005	UH WHICH WORDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT T
Line_5007	HOW WHERE YOUR BULBS CHANGED THINGS
Line_5008	THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS SMALLER TWO SO PRETTY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAMPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BYE MARNE HAVE A NICE STAY
Line_5011	AH MY HI MY NAME IS CATHER AND I AM NINE YEARS OLD WILL YOU TOLD ME A QUESTION
Line_5012	CORPACITA MEASUREMENT DECLINE AND SUMIT
Line_5013	ALL ABOUT HEIGHT EH I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT'S A QUWISHED
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A ROLLER AND UH A METER STICK
Line_5016	THEY ARE TOUBES
Line_5017	AND TALL AND CAN TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WOW UH I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	OH I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I KNEW NOT NO ALL
Line_5022	THE DORNO ON THE PICTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM N THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SH
Line_5025	I STEAL ONE ME UM TEN METERS A HUNDRED METERS AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WITH ODOR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS OUT OF BEGGER THAN ROARES
Line_5028	HEY A DORNOB I MEAN A KNOB ON A DOOR
Line_5029	YOU CAN ILL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A RULER
Line_5030	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE H
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BULBS YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IT IT'S TEN CATTANLIE AN ERS UM IN THIS PICTURE
Line_5034	ALL THOSE HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS TALL IN ALL
Line_5035	THREES CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A RULER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE MOTORS MOST MORE COMMON
Line_5037	THIS BOY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEEDED
Line_5039	WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS S YARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THE
Line_5043	SOME ARE THE SAME WINGS
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU CAN USE A RULER OR YOU CAN MEAN YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	Y YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEANT METER STICKS AND RULERS
Line_5047	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5048	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM WITH A SCALE
Line_5049	I DO NOT TEN THE WHOLE
Line_5050	WELL THERE WEIGHS THAT OR LIKE COME ATE THESE TO LIGHTS
Line_5051	ITS HEAVIER THAN A CHIP
Line_5052	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN CLASS AND FACE THE ANSWER
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST WAS THE EDGE OF THE MAGNET WAS THEN THE OT WOODEN AND THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE JU
Line_5054	I DON'T KNOW ANSWERS I IT'S A QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING BALANCED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR MATTER SEE THEN YOU ALL MAKE IT MEASURE SO IT'S A LITTLE METAL
Line_5056	THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THE C
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WEIGHT A BONE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURES SHOW ME THAT NOT THE MIDTAL MUSHURE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM ONE I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MORE A CURRENT
Line_5061	WOUND MMM IS GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT LAND METAL
Line_5062	WELL MEASURE IT'S LIKE YEAH BUT WELL I FORGOT
Line_5063	WEED UHM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5065	WELL A SMALL PAPER CLIP I WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE IN AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIPS SMALL ONE PAPER CUPS T
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HEAVIEST AS ONE'S NOT HEAVINGS
Line_5068	THE LITTLE CUBE IN FRONT ME AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAMS
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS WORE GRAMS ALL WEIGH UNTIL IN CANETY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	MISS PICTURE'S TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THAT METAL WASHER
Line_5072	AN SAVE SIX FIVE MORE THREE TWO WELL N THEN THE LITTLE WASHERS GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE BOOM
Line_5074	WITH THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAM TEN GRAM TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	H KNOW WHAT GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	OKAY UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH UH I DO NOT MEAN TO
Line_5078	I DO NOT I TOLD YOU ARE MA I DO NOT R
Line_5079	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERENCE IS OR T
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS F FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THERE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	ITS IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKE SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TO TO MEASURE THAT CURRENT KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TOO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVY USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S DONE A KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WA UH I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SCIENCE T
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASUREMENT MEASURED MAN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING S WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
Line_5092	L IT'S A MEASURE HEART OH I'VE BEEN MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE COURTHS OF WATER MAYBE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S LINES AND THAT COULD PROBABLY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD
Line_5095	WITH VILE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND B ONE COULD HOLD A MORE LIKE TWICE THAT MUCH A BILE TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VILE COULD PROP THROUGH
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE A BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS THAT WAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER IS HOLDING A THOUSAND NIWUILITORS OR ONE ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW M HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH IT CAN
Line_5100	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOWS IT'S ONCE A MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM MILLILITERS WON'T BE HOLD OR HOW I CA WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED MILLI TIES AND THE BIG FEET TWO BE THING THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5104	TAKES TEN LITTLE TOO BITES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILLILITER
Line_5105	WHEN BAKE A TRICK YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS
Line_5106	UM WELL I I FORGOT
Line_5107	A MILLOW METER IS BIGGER THAN A LITERS SOR
Line_5108	YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS A FEW INCHES MILLIMETERS OR LITERS
Line_5110	IT COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THING THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	IT'S A MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS AND THE ERMAN
Line_5113	UH IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCIENCE OLD OR
Line_5114	UM WELL OLD AM WE WOULD PUT THE WATER IN THE RAIN AND WE WOULD SPREAD IT INTO SOMETHING YOU SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS THREE CRANGEST KILO
Line_5116	WELL CORENDER'S CAN UM YEAH
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS IT WON'T FILL UP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE OR HOW MUCH IT WILL HELP BUT WELL WHEN EH STOPPED FIFTY MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES REPRESENT HOW MANY WA
Line_5120	IT IS A GRADUATED SOUNDER
Line_5121	THINK IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN HOLD A L HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER OR THE LIQUID'S IN IT
Line_5123	WELL THERE'S MORE GRADUATED SILANDERS THAT ARE FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5124	L M I DON'T KNOW UH HALF THE SIME
Line_5125	WHEN YOU PREDICT YOU COULD MAKE A AN ESTIMATE AND MAKE A LINE AND SEE IF IT WILL GO OVER UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING IS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN ASK
Line_5127	E TO LIKE TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL IT'S WAY IN THE LAND AND OLD MARS SEE
Line_5129	DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDIED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM OBSERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS HOW FULL
Line_5132	THE CUP I UH HAS MORE AND THAN IN IN
Line_5133	EL CAPACITY SO DON'T ALLY KNOW
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WERE YOU PUT A C WATER AND A CONTAINER AND YOU FILL IT IT CAPACITY
Line_5135	THIS SAYS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSEL
Line_5136	THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL HOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HI RE FATTER SKINNIER AND IT COULD JUST HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	TAKE WELL EVERY ONE EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU PUT IN IT'S A HUNDRED AND EQUALS A TO TO HUNDRED MILLILITERS WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLD THE SAME MATH OF WATER
Line_5139	OH MORE THAN WET A HUN
Line_5140	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5141	THIS IS NOT A MILLEVY BUT IT IT IT HAS A GRADUALLY GAINED AND IT'S SIELANDER
Line_5142	ILINDER
Line_5143	THEY USING A CURI
Line_5144	CUP ON THE LEFT HAS MORE WATER ON THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS WATER
Line_5145	YOU COULD PICK A SOR ENGINE I WANT HIM NO NO WHAT'S MORE
Line_5146	YOU COULD ARRANGE ER ER A CERTAIN YOU CAN PUT IT ON FIFTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTY TILL IT SLEW UP
Line_5147	MORE THE MINUS
Line_5148	YOU MUST HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5149	WELL IT IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE IN
Line_5150	USING THE WAY USING THAT
Line_5151	S'S HOW MUCH IT LESS
Line_5152	HUH I OBSERVED L
Line_5153	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5154	AT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN CAPACITY TO THE VERY TIPPY TOP
Line_5155	HOW MUCH IT CAN HALL THE CAPACITY OF IT
Line_5156	I NOT KNOW
Line_5157	IF MAY ALL SAKE IT WHOLE MORE AND ME CANT
Line_5158	IT CAN HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAN HOLD THAT MUCH AND THAT'S HOW MUCH
Line_5159	I KNOW THAT IT'S A CIRCANTAGE ME
Line_5160	THE CAMMITTIVE BECAUSE WELL TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE LIKE THELESS AND YEA
Line_5161	ON A WHOLE FIFTY ONE COULD ONLY A HUNDRED ONE AND A THOUSAND WHICH'S ONE LATER
Line_5162	ALL WHAT'S GOING ON IS
Line_5163	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5164	PAIN WASHERS FROM GOOD
Line_5165	ITS HOLDS A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5166	YOU COULD USE THE LINER OR BEAKERS OR CENTIMETERS LIKE OR
Line_5167	MIKANEISAS ORANGES
Line_5168	YOU PULL IT UP AND THE WATER FALL
Line_5169	OH IT'S THAT FAR RIGHT NOW
Line_5170	MEAT LIKE A PAIN
Line_5171	OH A HOUNDRED FORTY AH THREE HUNDRED I
Line_5172	OW YOU IT IT UP HOW MUCH ER WOULD HOLD AND IT'S HOLDING UM
Line_5173	BECAUSE THE WATER WAS JUST ON IT COULD BRO
Line_5174	WELL TO FILL SO
Line_5175	OH THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
Line_5176	UM WELL AVERSING A MINE THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED WITH THE WITH THE CUP WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_5177	I FORGOT IT
Line_5178	WELL M THAT'S COLD AND I CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
Line_5179	WELL WE DID UHM EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD CHECK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT ARE THINGS
Line_5180	UM WE PLAY UH HOW MUCH SALCIUS
Line_5181	IT SAYS FIFTY THINGS IS
Line_5182	WELL YOU'D PROBABLY BE APP SORT
Line_5183	WELL WHEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IT THE N
Line_5184	E I OBSERVED TEN MINTS
Line_5185	WELL IT CHANGES BECAUSE I SEE COLD AND FREE
Line_5186	H IT GOES UP AND IT GOES DOWN
Line_5187	THE SACS AND
Line_5188	IT I CAN TELL YOU YEAH
Line_5189	WELL YOU'VE EXTERMINE SEE I LILY COULD COUNT YOUR WEIGH UP TO WHERE THAT T
Line_5190	IT BLOWS YOU'RE A SILSAA
Line_5191	ONE OF THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS TWEN-
Line_5192	BUT WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GASES IN IT AND THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO YUP
Line_5193	IT'S CALLED UN MILL AREA AND IT'S GOING O GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
Line_5194	OH MY NAME IS SARA UM IS REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
Line_5195	YES AND THEN REALLY EXCITED SO START
Line_5196	WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_5197	UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE
Line_5198	UM LIKE S UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
Line_5199	THEY MIGHT COME UP WITH A DECISION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT STANDARD
Line_5200	IT SHOWS HOW LONG A METER IS AND UM HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_5201	THERE'S A MOST IN SCIENTIPIC STUDY FOR LIKE RAY LONG THINGS ARE REALLY SHORT THINGS YEAH
Line_5202	HOW LONG THE DOORKNOB IT'S FROM THE FLOOR
Line_5203	THEY ARE PART OF THE METRIC SISTORM OF THE WORLD
Line_5204	WELL WHAT OUR TEACHERS SAYS IS USED FOR PINKIE FIRST CENTIMETERS AND YOU HUM I PINKIE FOR RECIMTOS
Line_5205	HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW
Line_5206	WELL VESSELS AN OLD SAYING THAT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT
Line_5207	UHM PRETTY GOOD
Line_5208	WITH LIKE A METER OR A RULER OR A YARD STICK
Line_5209	TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL THINGS
Line_5210	YOU GET A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE
Line_5211	WE MEASURED UM TO ARM FOOT TO HA UM
Line_5212	ROEBEE'S NOSE IS ONE PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIES THING GOES FINGER LIKES
Line_5213	H I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE REFERENCE IS
Line_5214	UM I DON'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER PARTY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE BONES I'VE TOLD YOU
Line_5215	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE STANDARDS ST AND OTHER UM CYSTUMS
Line_5216	YOU UM I COMPARING MASS WE DO MAGNETS
Line_5217	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE METAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE HEAVIEST
Line_5218	WELL WE COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND OR ANYWHERE
Line_5219	UM MEASUREMENTS MORE ACTUAL THAN AH
Line_5220	EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHT'S
Line_5221	TWO GROUPS PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIPS AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIP
Line_5222	HAVE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5223	YOU'LL GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5224	F UH
Line_5225	REALLY YOU HAD TO EXPLAIN E
Line_5226	O WE USED GRAM BLOCKS
Line_5227	UM GRAMS UH N OH
Line_5228	ONE THE P EQUALS ONE GRAM B
Line_5229	UM I THINK IT OUTS
Line_5230	AT GRAMS EQUALS ONE METAL DISK
Line_5231	IT'LL BE UM IT WILL BE LIKE BRIGHT
Line_5232	UM THE STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5233	THE STANDARD FIND ALSO INCHES AND UM FEET
Line_5234	WE I'M SORRY FOR THE PAS PICK POS
Line_5235	WEIGHT WEARING
Line_5236	GRAMS ARE ABOUT UM EH ALL ABOUT UM
Line_5237	UM SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRAMS SOMETHING I
Line_5238	UM I DIDN'T SAY ANY THINGS
Line_5239	GRAMS ARE UM YOU MEAN OF MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_5240	IF THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIES
Line_5241	HELLO WE
Line_5242	UM THERE IS A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THE
Line_5243	UM YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5244	IT'S A SMALL GRAM I'M GUESSING
Line_5245	OH IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAINS
Line_5246	WEIGHING HEAVERIER THINGS B
Line_5247	IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5248	NO EVERYBODY YOU WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
Line_5249	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UHM DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND MASS
Line_5250	DRY SPUNCH EATS SPUNCH S SPONCH
Line_5251	UM IT'S REALLY DRY AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON A WEIGH THAT MUCH
Line_5252	UM IF GO AWAY A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE SILK DEEPUNGEE
Line_5253	UM I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SALK SPUNGE OR A WET SPUNGE BUT IT'S DEFFEINALLY NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S A DRY SPUNGE
Line_5254	WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM LORGICALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF WHERE THE SPUNGES RIGHT
Line_5255	THE DRY SPUNGIE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	UM NO T MONTHS
Line_5257	PUT DRY SPONGES PEE GRAMS
Line_5258	IT IS EX TIN
Line_5259	UM YOU CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH UHM
Line_5260	HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGHT I WRAPPED
Line_5261	AS GRAMS A BEG
Line_5262	I MERICUL
Line_5263	GOD I
Line_5264	THE SAND AT
Line_5265	YOU COULD WAVY THE BOTTOM
Line_5266	GRAM PIECES AND ANOTHER CUP A LOTS OF THINGS
Line_5267	FOR I LOST IT'S GOING TO SAY
Line_5268	ISN'T AN A VOLUMES MASS AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVEL UH YOU CAN MEASURE IT WON'T TO SMALL OBJECTS WITH THIS
Line_5271	MELTING A PLAYING IT BY A HUNDRED S
Line_5272	SMILE IS
Line_5273	THE PLEARMOMETERS UM COUNTING BY TURNS THIS IS CANNON BY ONES AND THIS IS COUNTING BY HUNDREDS
Line_5274	ALUM OH THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN SINCE
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED Y
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR ANY LIQUID
Line_5277	CHOO CAME BAKING I USED THAT BIRL LOT OF THINGS I
Line_5278	UM BE EXACTLY THE SAME D A MILLIMETER LITERS A MILLILITERS
Line_5279	SMALL OBJECTS WERE LIQUID OBJECTS
Line_5280	IT'S UM MEAN A MOUNT IT'S A SMALL WO THEN THE METERS
Line_5281	ILE A MEASURING CUP A MINE SHARING SPOON
Line_5282	A BALANCE A
Line_5283	CAPTIONS CALLED BUT IT'S USED FOR METISON AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED THE A PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TACK LIKE THAT
Line_5285	MEAL LITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBERS THAT THE ERIN L IT IS FURRY FINDS A SCREW UP
Line_5287	R VOICES A LOUD TO DAY BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	IT'S A SPOON BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW ONE TO WELL THREE
Line_5289	THOSE ARE MILLIMETERS
Line_5290	WEED SILANDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR SMALL OBJECTS
Line_5292	IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IT'S WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACES THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO BEAM ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINS UM
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HAD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THEN YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A INCH YOU COULD BY SYRINGE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILLED UP
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT YOU P I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT SKINNIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT WILL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM
Line_5301	THEY'RE WE ARE EITHER TALLER BUT SHINIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZERO W
Line_5304	ONE MINUTE A SALAD TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO THE
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN IT'S HOTTER DAM IDELSE COALTAR
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER IT GOT TWENTY DEGREES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM TO P
Line_5308	UM I DON'T STAND LAUGH
Line_5309	E SOR I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU REPEAT
Line_5310	I NEED STAR BOYS FIRST SO
Line_5311	UM A CHANGED RILLY UP QUICKLY GOES
Line_5312	WE DREW IT ON GRAPHS PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE TO UM F
Line_5314	L EXES OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WHO YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UPUPAUNTHE WE
Line_5317	IT'S TIMES HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY I'M GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WELL AND IT UP
Line_5321	IT GOT IT WAS STUNNED THAT TEN AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MA IT I GUESS BY FIVE SE
Line_5323	JUST BE COUNTING BY TENS OR FIFTY
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IT GETS WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT HITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THES UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE IN THE UM C
Line_5328	GOOD BYE AM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT I
Line_5329	HOLLOW MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH RULERS YARD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURERS AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
Line_5332	E WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DISC AND WE HAD TO FINGER OUT THE PERIMETER T
Line_5333	I USED A YARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY IS
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS S WITH THOSE AND I THINK THEY'RE STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF THE IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YOD STICK OR A RULER IT'S THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	BIT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVEN NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETER'S
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DEC DECIMETERS AND A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WE MEASURED THE COMPANCAPACITY OF A CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP A
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE CAMPACITY
Line_5346	WE USED ON THE COMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU'VE HAD POUR IT IN A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRAGITATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELLS YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MIL MILLILITERS
Line_5350	T'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND NET'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PRTY MUCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACI- CAPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP A WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	THE CUP THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5354	SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S YOUR IT'S H IT'S THE FULL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSUALS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND CAPACITY
Line_5357	THAT TELL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE CAMPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER B
Line_5361	CAMPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH AM WHAT THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE CAMPACITY OF THE AN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT A CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENT SO IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLUME AND THE CAMPACITY THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENT
Line_5367	THE COMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLUME
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAMPACITY OF A CANS
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER A IS THE VOLUME OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LITERS AND THE SMALLER ONES IS MILLILITERS
Line_5372	IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED SYLINDER
Line_5373	IT'S LABLED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THEN YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM E ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THAT WAS
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETERS EVERY MINUTE
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARM
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY HAVE Y UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINUTE
Line_5380	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT S UP HI AND THEN IT GOES UP PRETTY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOWLY MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GLASS AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5382	I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND SENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	T WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FULLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	ARMS IT WENT FROM TWENTY ALL THE WEIGHT TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY SLOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES ON THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THING AND LENGTH AND THEN AWAY WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO A AND THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	HE IS TRYING TO FINGER OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE MORSE
Line_5389	TO FIGURE OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT WAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULBS
Line_5392	A WIRE HAS TO BE IN HIGH PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IN
Line_5394	WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINUS WEIGHT FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UM THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND T
Line_5396	UMM NO
Line_5397	THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING THE COLLEGE SORT OF E LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM A HIGHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM THEN IT IT JUST
Line_5400	WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NO I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE THE NOTCHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ANOTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN REMEMBER THE NAME OF
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPES OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLELL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	IT ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB BIRDS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL UP PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DOES FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BUT ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE ONE THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	ATER TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOMETIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	AND THE ROCKS THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON VILANES STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUFF TOGETHER THEY WOULD SEE LIKE THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF YOU T TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK E ALL TIMES BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UHM IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT ON A MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAYS LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	Y YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	O THAT THE HELP JUST CHINA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	ER OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHERS SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARTBORBDS IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO DO
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE ROLE THING
Line_5433	BE CAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY SO WON'T PICK UP ANY YOU KNOWS THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT GOES RIGHT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH THEM
Line_5438	TE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE ELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THEN WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WILL NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACTS LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START TO START RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT'LL STARTS GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE SINCE YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T START WORKING
Line_5446	LE THE RIGHT PLACES IN THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	AND THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINE IS PLACED AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE ON THE PLUS PLACED SO IT'LL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IT
Line_5450	TO DAY I MADE POSTERS PEACE POSTERS
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPERS IN THE MIDDLE AND THE MAGNET BELOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIPS AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS ON ON THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIP S
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY AND THE IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONES
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TO DAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PIECE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PIECE AND NOT DRUGS AND ALL THOSE OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WAR IS BAD TWO BUT PIECES REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE PINT POSTORS OUT FOR PIECE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS IT THEN IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH SO THE LIGHT BULB W
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL THE ELEC- ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE E
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT ON A BATTER THE BAT WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINUS S
Line_5465	WELL SINCE I CLICKED ON THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL IT I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	S OR A B OR S D E
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BATTERY WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULB CARRY
Line_5469	AN IN V AND AFTER YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING I THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR THE LAST THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE WE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A A MOTOR SPIN
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY UH UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE ITS ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIEGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DUNG CLASS
Line_5478	THAT'S THE ELECTRIC CURRENTS HAS A PLACE TO GO
Line_5479	HE IMPORTANT SAYING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRE IS AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THEY OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULBS WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THE M
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAYS THAT IS GOING OUT OF IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD GO IN AND UP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE A UH NO IT FLOW TO THE LIST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS EITHER BY DROPPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPPED THEM IN THE RIM CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT B
Line_5488	MOUNT WEIGHT BRAKES THE MAGNETIC WEAIVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC WHEAT ARE THEY CALLED
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WEILVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW SINGS THAN BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURNS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON NO S
Line_5492	M I WOULD THINK THAT IF I HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINDS IT HAS THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE POWERFUL ELECTRO MAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKES IT THE ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	UM IT IT BUSED IS AND INDEX PO IT SPUN AROUND AND SO ELSES
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSE A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARTIMAL LIGHT
Line_5497	AL BATTERIES CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH IN IT TO MAKE THE MOTORS TURN ON AND OFF
Line_5499	ENERGY WE FOUND IT IT CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT RUN
Line_5500	A BATTERIES CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS ON ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE BULB
Line_5502	UM ONE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UN IT MAKES IT SO THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	THE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT IN A CIRCLE
Line_5505	WE LOVED THE PAR CLIP ON A MAGNET THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5507	UH IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN T PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL LOW TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH THE EL MAGNET YOU CAN'T DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLD US PUT YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES AN LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS I JUST DON'T THINK TO WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MIX THE FLAT S
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FAST TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE THE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT IT WAS IN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	BECAUSE IT'S STILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED B IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM HMM WHAT YOU EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAID IT JUST SWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTOR IS FLOAT RUNS
Line_5522	INSTEAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THEY'LL I GIRL FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE OUR SWITCH THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEIGHT TO LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
Line_5525	W YOU WON'T DO IT LIKE ON
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S A WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS UH WHAT'S YOU CALL IT IT
Line_5529	WHAT'S IT CALLED THE WATER PARA
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THEM THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	IT UHM DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	U I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	IN THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLE SILL KEEPS WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN BRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING UP TO D ENABLE HARD WERE EXCELLARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCH THE BATTERIES I NOTICED THAT THEY BECAME MORE PRET
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERIES THEY A YOU COULDN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	Y YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD BUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE AND ONE HAT I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITCH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE UM ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULB'S BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHERS
Line_5548	I THINK IT SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNETS
Line_5550	AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOX AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METAL TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS COPPER
Line_5552	AND UHM UM IF
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT HIM SOMEWHERE IN THE CORE BOX AND WE TRIED TO FIND IT
Line_5554	WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPASS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX AND THEN WE SERCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	TE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THERE IS A METAL OR UH LIKE A ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO IT SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER MA MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TECHNICALLY FINDS UH METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIND METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WAS MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUPS
Line_5561	Y USING LIKE A NAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOX AND FIND IT STILL IT FUELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY STICK TO CERTAIN KINDS
Line_5563	IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHERE LEVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NO IT DID NOT IT JUST KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLEGHT
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5566	THE THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LETTER SIDE THE PENS L
Line_5567	YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THE D IS HEAVY AND THEY ARE NOT STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER CAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUITE SURE
Line_5571	T YOU THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MA A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I THINK AND THEN
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UP SO IT UM TURNS ON AND TURNS OFF
Line_5575	IT'S IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UHM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD A UM PLAY AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A MOTOR
Line_5578	UH UM W
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	HER ENERGY UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	U CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	UH WE PUT IT UNDER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY OPINION I WOULD I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UHM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE THING INSIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THESE LITTLE SANBLES AND WE SAW UM IN A QUES AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH LIKE THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB IN WALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	UM THE DRAMS RELATE BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WHERE STARTED BUT IT GOES A WRAGE FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	UM IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY AND THIS SLOW AND THEN SUCK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HUNK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THEY THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE NE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HURKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLATES
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HULKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN'T GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE I ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL TO THE PLATE
Line_5602	UM WELL AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS A MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE LIGHT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT IT LEAVES TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO THE OTHER ONE IT COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY Y
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE PAPER THAT HAS THES SIMBLES AND IT THEY'RE ON D
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S A BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM IS NOT QUITE
Line_5616	WE MADE A MAGNET THAT CAN TURN OFF IT UM
Line_5617	UH WEIGHT WA UH
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE UM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE E RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NO THINGS HAPPEN I
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAGNET THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I'M NOT YET QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S UH SPECTURAL METAL B I'M NOT QUITE SURE
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIED THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWDER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE I USED JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT I NOT SURE IF I'M CORRECTED JUST IN MY OPINION UH
Line_5629	WELL IF THE CIRCLES DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WE UH SO JUST WAIT I FORGET I
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIED THE WIRES TOUCHING IT INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
Line_5632	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE AS HELP FROM THE ERMOCINE AND HE TOLD US TRY WRAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT UM THEY STICK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKES THE MAKES THE LIGHTS TURN ON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FORM ELECTRO- ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOU WILL NEED MORE YOU
Line_5641	NOW BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAYS BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	YES YOU CAN STILL MAKE A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGGESS THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TOO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE WRONG PLACES
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE RAN
Line_5648	IN THE WRONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE ON
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY LE BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACES FOR IT TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I IS YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS P PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS I WOULD WORK TWO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BOTH UM THE W
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRE'S SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5657	IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECTS
Line_5658	UM THERE'RE
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE THE SPONGE ITS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	UHM SO THE SO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THEN NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UH I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5662	UM YES IT IS BECAUSE I I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMILAR TO TH IS
Line_5666	U YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AND MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULB YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAIN
Line_5670	YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORK WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	Y YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YES SCIENCE IS VERY EQUAL
Line_5674	I'M IT SIN THAT'S HOW MANY
Line_5675	IPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	THEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THEY ARE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHERS GOING INTO A CUP S IT HAD UNHOOKED THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEING HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UNHOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	BUT IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING D CHEACHED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY ARE BEEN DETRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT IS HARINDING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PUSH THE ON WASHER THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATES THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GRABS WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YES IT DOES TELLS US
Line_5686	ARE IT TAKES TO BAKE THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHERS IT TAKES TO BREAK THE FOURS
Line_5688	MORE THE METAL WASHERS THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO BRACK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_5689	I I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HUH THE WIRES THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT IT SPIN
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM IN THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BATTERY A BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WELL YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTORS RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DID SCIENCE WHERE WE USED THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU WOULD PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BODDLEMUH CORNER AND THEN YOU OULD HAVE
Line_5697	I I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT WHATEVER IS IN HERE IS A S A LIGHT BULB UH
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S IT IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A SCREW RIGHT NO
Line_5700	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE GONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY THINGS
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPENING
Line_5704	NOT IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT A THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND A PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY Y
Line_5707	AT THE MAGNET CAN GO THROUGH THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_5709	UM WE BUILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEWHERE WHERE I DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT
Line_5710	WHEN THE METAL SHAVINGS FOUND THE MAGNETS THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE MAGNET'S ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NOT IT HAS TO BE KIND OF UH THIN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARDBOARD
Line_5713	UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIGHER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	'CAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNET IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT WAS S YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOUR HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNETS THERE
Line_5718	BE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE ON A OFF SWITCH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON IN OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE I ENOUGH SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THOUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR IS NOT GOING TO RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR REAL RUN
Line_5721	OTORS IF THE MOTOR'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DO WE DO IT FOUR
Line_5723	A IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5725	YOU WOULD PUT BUT WIRES AT THE BULB OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT UP BUT SENSE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCH UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULBS
Line_5727	ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM UM ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED UP THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM YEAH UH BECAUSE WE TRIED THAT A COUPLE TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEY'D CALLED
Line_5731	AND NOW ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	L THE WAY WE DID IT IS A SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECT UN CONNECTED SO THE ELECTROMAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRIC
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET M IT'LL GO THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	H ELECTRICITY'S FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	POWDER IS GETTING TROUBLE THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS F FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	THE REASON THAT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT ERCHED TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY'S GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MINING AND SINCE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP THE ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASILY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWES THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT MIX THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5748	INSULATION MEANS LIKE THE COPPER WIRE IS AND SIDE OF THE GREEN COATING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN UM A SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS S STAY MAGNETIC
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND YES PUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME I CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE AH THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN'T THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I I OBSERVE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINES AND IT CANNOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NO I WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNING ABOUT THE E ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT ON SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LET'S GO APART
Line_5760	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WILL UM THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN THEM
Line_5762	RACK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL AND THEM CONNECTS TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM IS ALUNIMINIUM HELUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE AND BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPELLING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING APART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNENECS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHERS
Line_5768	CAN SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET EN THE MAGNETS TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	WHEN NINETEEN WASHERS BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TWO A HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROPBABLY SEPARATE QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FORCES FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE WELL THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACES TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU'LL GET A HI ER NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS IN YOU GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANY MORE
Line_5776	WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND DOWND JUST SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND BE CREATIVBE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY S TURN ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THERE'RE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR A LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	UM I FORGET IT'S NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN ES AND IT USES SIMBLES TO TELL YUM INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE D TAILS
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	THIS SHOWS YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THROUGH THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY I MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NEW WIRES
Line_5785	Y YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TODAY WE GET THIS FUN MYSTERY THING WITH THE BAT FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	EN NO WIRES CONNECTED TO BE
Line_5788	HI MY NAME IS JONAH
Line_5789	HI OUR NAME IS JONA WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS
Line_5790	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM AND SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORKS
Line_5791	WELL THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO A B ON A AND THE AND THE ONE ON D
Line_5792	WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECTS KEEPS THE CIRCUIT IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRADS THAT THE WIRES ATTACHED TO A OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
Line_5794	WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORKS
Line_5795	UM A THE CONDUCTORS
Line_5796	WELL A GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UM WORK
Line_5797	WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTACHED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MYSTERY BOARD BY A WIRES AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
Line_5798	WELL THAT SO IS THAT UM THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MYSTERY BOARD ARE CONNECTED FROM A AND SE
Line_5799	WELL A CIRCUIT IS A ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S UM MAKING SOMETHING WORK
Line_5800	UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU MUST ASK ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
Line_5801	UM THE BUT UM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5802	UM WELL JUST M MORE WITH ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIGHT UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5803	I ONE I'M NOT SURE
Line_5804	I I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5805	UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLASCADA BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINE'S SIDE NO THE BATTERY
Line_5806	WELL WELL IT'S ALWAYS COMING INTO THE PLUS SIDE INTO THE INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5807	WELL IT ALWAYS COMES IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE AND OUT THAT NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5808	IT UM IT ALWAYS FLOWS OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND ALWAYS COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5809	WELL IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY FROM THE PLUS SIDE SO YEAH
Line_5810	WELL IF THE B CUP IF IT'S TOO HEAVY IN THE B CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THEN IT'LL BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5811	UM IF YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER AND IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
Line_5812	WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FORCE IS PARTLY STRONG
Line_5813	WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAKS THE FORCE
Line_5814	THEY'RE GETTING SPREADS APART
Line_5815	THE DISTANCE INCREASES
Line_5816	THE MAGNETIC FORCE SLOWLY WEAKENS INTEL IT'S NOT MAGNETIC UN IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5817	WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO SPACES ATRIUM NOR
Line_5818	GROUP GO GROUP D THEY ALL ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT GROUPS SEE JUST GOING TO THROUGH THEIR WASHERS IN AND BAD ORDER
Line_5819	WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5820	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING UH THIS CIRCUIT IS ONE BATTERY AND IT'S POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT ONCE
Line_5821	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5822	AND UH YEAH
Line_5823	WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAS ONE
Line_5824	EACH EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_5825	YEAH EACH COMPONENT HAS THEIR OWN PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5826	WELL THE BULBS AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5827	WELL UM THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5828	WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN UH PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5829	TWO PATHWAYS S I THINK
Line_5830	THIS REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5831	IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5832	THAT UM THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE POWER
Line_5833	WELL THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND ITS
Line_5834	UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S A PROBABLY A MAGNET IN IT
Line_5835	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAYS IT'S GOING
Line_5836	WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISM IS AH LIKE WHAT THE FILINGS ARE GETTING PULLED TOO
Line_5837	T I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM CORNER
Line_5838	E PAPER CLIP FLIES TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUSHING IS PULLING IT IN
Line_5839	UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
Line_5840	WELL WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE MAGNET IT'LL START POURING REAL HARD AND THEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING AT IT SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE'S MAGNET
Line_5841	WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5842	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP AROUND THE CORD THE UHM THE STRONGER THE ELECT UM MAGNET WILL BE
Line_5843	UM I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5844	THAT MEANS THEN ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_5845	WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AN IRON CORN IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP UM LIKE WASHERS
Line_5846	UM WELL UH NOT SURE
Line_5847	THE UM CORE WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE UM WASHERS
Line_5848	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
Line_5849	WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THE THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW SO THE THE CIRCUIT THE THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5850	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT IT WILL PICK UP CELL WASHERS
Line_5851	IF THE UM UM SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL O THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
Line_5852	T THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET WORKS
Line_5853	WELL THE CORE MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO PULL THE P WASHERS AWAY
Line_5854	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED AROUND IT AND IT IS A PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5855	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5856	WELL WE HAD A L A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_5857	WELL YOU HAVE TO USE THE UM THE D CELLS TO GET THE UH ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5858	IT PRITY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO YOU CAN SPIN AROUND THE CIRCUIT
Line_5859	I THINK THE REASON IT UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOURCE USED ABOUT A LIGHTBULB
Line_5860	WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GUIDE IT THEN THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GUIDES IT THROUGH
Line_5861	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULB LIGHT
Line_5862	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUNNING THOUGH THE WIRES
Line_5863	ELECE ELECTRICITY
Line_5864	I MEASURE WHEAT CONTACT POINTS ARE
Line_5865	UM YOU CONNECTED HIM TO EACH CONTACT N AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
Line_5866	WELL UM WELL UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THE SIDE
Line_5867	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5868	WELL A D CELL GIVES THEY UM GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
Line_5869	TE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
Line_5870	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING WE SO IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
Line_5871	UM THE CIRCUIT UM UM IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STORES TO UP AGAIN
Line_5872	WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PARK WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A FLAG SO THE FLAG SPINNING AROUND
Line_5873	THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SLIT AROUND
Line_5874	IT'S MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_5875	UM IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GOING LI
Line_5876	LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING ATTACHED TO A CONTACT POINT SO IT'S GETTING LIT
Line_5877	UM THERE IS A MOTOR AT THE BOTTUM
Line_5878	U IT HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THE CORD
Line_5879	WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE QU AR MORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BATTERIES IN
Line_5880	UM THAT'S SHOWING THAT IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED WINDS IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5881	ONE HUNDRED MIGHT WINDS MEANS THAT OR PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5882	WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5883	UM IF YOU FUN IF IT'S NOT IS WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
Line_5884	THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5885	WELL THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AROUND THE CORE IN MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5886	WELL THE UM THE MORE WINDS YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT WILL PICK UP
Line_5887	WELL ONE WAY TO STRENGTHEN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINGS AROUND THE BOAT MORE TIMES
Line_5888	OH YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES
Line_5889	UM SOME OF THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY
Line_5890	UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST IN KEEPS INCREASING AND THE MORE WASHERS YOU UM I MEAN THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT
Line_5891	BECAUSE THE MORE UM IT'S MORE TO CLOSE TO ELECTRICITIES BEGGERS THE ELECT UM THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5892	IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD BIGGER
Line_5893	WELL UM THE MORE UM WIRE WRAPS YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THEM MORE UH WASHERS S
Line_5894	WHAT'S SHOWING ALL BUT MORE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5895	WELL THE MORE UH WRAP SA YOU DO THE HIRES THE GRAPE AT UM BECAUSE THAT'S UH WE'RE THE WASHERS ARE
Line_5896	UM THE FARTHER YOU RIGHT IT INCREASES TEN WRAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIGHER E
Line_5897	WELL WHEN THE NUMBER WRAPS GET LARGER THEM THE DATA THE UM WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP
Line_5898	THERE ARE INCREASING UM HOW MUCH YOU UM PICK UP
Line_5899	WELL THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU GET THE MORE WASHERS WASHERS SHOON'T PICK UP
Line_5900	WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP IT MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THEN WHEN IT'S NOT A STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
Line_5901	IT MEANS ITS STRONGER
Line_5902	BECAUSE UH NINETY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE BOTH FIFTEEN WRAPS
Line_5903	WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCTOR S IT IS
Line_5904	AND OPENS IT AN OPEN CIRCUITS
Line_5905	WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKES IT SPIN
Line_5906	H MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5907	WELL IF YOU HAVE AN INSULATOR THE MOTOR'S NOT GOING TO WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONDUCTOR THE UM MOTORS WILL RUN
Line_5908	WELL WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO IT IT WILL JUST STOP WORKING
Line_5909	WELL SOMETIMES METAL STICK TO MAGNETS BUT NO PLASTIC WE'LL
Line_5910	WELL WELL THE NAIL ON THE RIGHT IS A STEEL NAIL AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS AN ALUMINIUM AND STEEL STICKS TO MAG MAGNETS BUT NOT ALUMINIUM
Line_5911	WELL THOSE ARE STEEL AND UM IRON THEY WILL STICK TO A MAGNET AND CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_5912	WELL WE'VE BEEN BUILDING CIRCUITS
Line_5913	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIRES ARE IN THE LITTLE BOARD IT'S A PRETICAL EXPERIMENT
Line_5914	THERE IS THERE IS A WIRES GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT D

Line_5936	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE
Line_5937	IT'S FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5938	WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING FASTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER
Line_5939	THE ENERGY IS GOING FASTER
Line_5940	WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL IN THE CIRCUIT THE THEN
Line_5941	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER
Line_5942	THE BULBS LIGHT UP BRIGHTER SO IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELLS YOU GET MORE LIGHT
Line_5943	WELL WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE D CELL THE
Line_5944	WELL A PLUS IS AGAINST PLUS AND MINUS IS POINTING OUT
Line_5945	WELL WHEN YOU ADD MORE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5946	THEN THE ENERGY FLOWS ABOUT TWO TIMES FASTER
Line_5947	THE LIGHT BULB'S LIKE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5948	THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5949	WELL IN THIS SEAMATIC THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5950	THE PARALLEL VERTICAL LINES UH REPRESENT BATTERIES
Line_5951	ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COOL
Line_5952	IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
Line_5953	WELL IN THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO D BRAKE THE POLE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5954	WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC POLE BECOMES WEAKER
Line_5955	WELL THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT
Line_5956	NICE TALK INTO YOU TOO BYE

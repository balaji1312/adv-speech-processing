Line_0	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1	THE CAR IS A SYSTEM
Line_2	THE WHEELS CAN MOVE
Line_3	THERE IS LIKE THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THERE'S LIKE THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE HEART AND THERE IS LIKE THE BRAIN
Line_4	CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
Line_5	I SEE WATER LIFE TREES THE SKY CLOUDS HOUSES AND A MOUNTAIN
Line_6	EARTH
Line_7	THE LIFE AND ALL THINGS LIKE TREES AND PLANTS AND AND FISH AND EVEN HUMAN
Line_8	LIFE
Line_9	I SEE A DESERT I SEE WELL A FOREST I SEE
Line_10	THE LIGHT BLUE REPRESENTS THE WETLANDS THE YELLOW REPRESENTS THE DESERTS THE PURPLE REPRESENTS LIKE THE FREEZING PLACES AND THE DARK GREEN REPRESENTS THE FORESTS
Line_11	WELL WETLANDS HAVE FROGS AND PLANTS AND FISH DESERTS HAVE LIKE UM SCORPIONS AND SNAKES AND AND THE FORESTS HAVE LIKE BEARS AND MOOSE AND TREES
Line_12	IT SHOWS ME LIKE A FOX A BUNNY A HUMAN A BIRD UM LIKE A BUG A FLOWER LIKE MUD AND GRASS OR LIKE I THINK THAT'S LIKE A MOUSE
Line_13	A FOOD
Line_14	IT IS WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS COULD GET EATEN BY LIKE THIS AN ANIMAL'S FOOD AN ANIMAL'S PREDATOR OR LIKE LIKE SO LET'S SAY A BUNNY RABBIT IS LIKE FOOD FOR A SNAKE A HAWK AND LIKE A THIS LIKE A MUSHROOM IS MUSHROOMS YEAH THERE'S MUSHROOMS THERE'S A LIZARD UM THERE'S LIKE BACTERIA GRASS BACTERIA'S FOOD FOR THE GRASS
Line_15	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_16	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER SOME FUNGI IS A DECOMPOSER AND GRASS IS A PRODUCER
Line_17	BYE
Line_18	HOW ARE YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WITH LIKE THE PLANTS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MONKEY AND THE HAWK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ALL ARE CONSUMERS AND THE BACTERIA AND THE FUNGI IS IS ARE LIKE THE DECOMPOSERS
Line_20	I PRODUCE MY OWN FOOD BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME BUT IF I WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY OWN ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FOOD KIND OF
Line_21	I WELL I LIKE HAVE MY OWN FOOD LIKE AN FROM AN ANIMALS LIKE LIKE SO LET'S SAY IF I WERE WELL SOMETHING LIKE HARE I WOULD EAT FOOD LIKE GRASS SOMETHING LIVING AND MY ONE OF MY PREDATORS WOULD BE LIKE A HAWK
Line_22	A DECOMPOSER KIND OF LIKE DECOMPOSES THEIR OWN FOOD LIKE A LIKE A ROTTEN FOOD OR PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_23	DECOMPOSING ROTTEN FOOD AND THE FOOD THAT THEY DECOMPOSED GAVE THEM ENERGY
Line_24	SOME WELL SOME STUFF EAT LIKE MAYBE FUNGI AND BACTERIA
Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PICTURES OF A WELL OF DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WELL LIKE THOSE ARE THE ONES KIND OF LIKE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN I THINK
Line_27	AN OMNIVORE I THINK IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANTS LIKE UM SAY LIKE BERRIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A OMNIVORE EATS ALL WELL SO IF OMNI IS THE PREFIX OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO OMNIVORES ARE ANIMALS THAT EAT ALL THINGS LIKE MEAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
Line_29	A CARNIVORE
Line_30	A MOOSE IS A VEGETARIAN
Line_31	THAT HELPS THEM WITH THEIR FOOD AND THAT IS A PART OF A ECOSYSTEM
Line_32	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_33	HOW ARE YOU
Line_34	HOW THE YEAST IS GROWING UP WELL IT'S LIKE MAKING THE BAG BIGGER AND LARGER AND BECAUSE THE ANIMAL CRACKER LIKE THAT ACTUALLY
Line_35	THAT YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND IT IS JUST LIKE A HUMAN BECAUSE IT NEEDS IT'S WATER AND IT NEEDS ITS FOOD
Line_36	THROUGH THE FACT THAT THAT IS LIKE MAYBE LIKE BACTERIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S LIKE BACTERIA IS TO US LIKE BUT THAT'S LIKE BACTERIA FOR THEM
Line_37	THE CIRCLE ONE THAT YOU JUST SHOWED IS PROBABLY A ONE THAT WAS IN A DARK BAG AND WE CHECKED OUR BAGS TODAY
Line_38	CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
Line_39	SUNLIGHT
Line_40	WELL ACTUALLY NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS JUST ONE THING IT HELPS THEM MAKE WATER AND DIE
Line_41	IT'S BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS A LIVING THING AND IT NEEDS WATER
Line_42	YES BECAUSE IT IS A BURGER AND PLANTS ARE THEY THINK DECOMPOSERS WHICH THEY NEED JUST KIDDING THEY'RE NOT DECOMPOSERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD LIKE BURGERS
Line_43	THAT PLANT'S A LIVING THING
Line_44	WHAT
Line_45	NO
Line_46	NO BECAUSE PLANTS USE FERTILIZER BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO USE IT
Line_47	YOU
Line_48	IT NEEDS WIND IT NEEDS SOIL IT NEEDS SUN AND IT NEEDS THOSE IMPORTANT STUFF
Line_49	THEY NEED CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN AND WHY IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT HELPS THEM SURVIVE AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE LIKE A PLANT
Line_50	THEIR LEAVES
Line_51	WIND IT DOESN'T GET WATER NO WIND NO OXYGEN NO CARBON DIOXIDE WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S ONLY JUST WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN IT GETS WATER AND WIND
Line_52	IT IS ALSO DYING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE LAST ONE BUT IT IS NOT GETTING ANY WATER AND THAT LOOK LIKE IT ALSO NEEDS THAT MATERIAL AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY WATER IT'S NOT GONNA LIVE AND LIKE I SAID PROCEED IT'S LIFE
Line_53	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_54	YES
Line_55	GOOD
Line_56	PLANTS
Line_57	SYSTEMS
Line_58	THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL BLOOD CELLS AND THEY MIGHT BE LIVING
Line_59	BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_60	REPEAT
Line_61	FLESH
Line_62	NO THEY'RE JUST LIKE ANIMALS ARE JUST LIKE HUMANS AND LIKE HUMANS ARE ANIMALS TOO AND THEY'RE ALL MADE THEY'RE ALL MADE OF SKIN CELLS BLOOD CELLS BRAIN CELLS
Line_63	THAT THEY'RE BLOOD CELLS
Line_64	I SEE MAYBE PLANT WELL A A LEAF WELL THIS IS A PICTURE OF A LEAF BLOOD CELL OF LEAF BLOOD CELLS
Line_65	THE LEAF HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOOKING CELLS AND THE HUMAN HAS JUST LIKE THREE OR FOUR LOOKING ONES BUT THE HUMAN ALSO HAS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ONES
Line_66	THEY NEED WINGS THEY NEED A BODY A HEAD ANTENNAS YOU KNOW LEGS
Line_67	IT THEY BOTH ARE LIVING
Line_68	BREAK DOWN FOOD
Line_69	BREAKING DOWN FOOD
Line_70	IT HAS THIS STUFF THAT PROTECTS THE STOMACH SO THIS LIKE TYPE OF ACID THAT IN THE ACID IT KIND OF BURNS DOWN THE FOOD
Line_71	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_72	ABOUT WELL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE VEINS AND THE LIVING SYSTEMS YOU KNOW LIKE THE VEINS AND XYLEM AND PHLOEM
Line_73	A LEAF
Line_74	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE SHAPES OF VEINS IN THEM LIKE DIFFERENT WAYS IT GOES LEAVES IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE LIKE I REMEMBER ONE OF THE WAS PARALLEL
Line_75	THERE THERE IS THREE TYPES OF LEAVES I REMEMBER TWO OF THEM ON IS PARALLEL ANOTHER IS PALMATE
Line_76	WELL LEAVES HAVE VEINS LIKE THAT TRAVEL LIKE THE SAP OR SOME AND THIS IS LIKE THE SAME THING HAS VEINS THAT TRAVEL YOU KNOW
Line_77	ABOUT ANIMALS AND HOW THEY GET ATTRACTED AND A BUNCH OF THEIR SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY GET NOTICED
Line_78	STRIPES I SEE LIKE HEXAGON SHAPED KIND OF THEY'RE LIKE RECTANGLES CURVED SHAPES AND STRIPES
Line_79	THE SMELL
Line_80	IT USES ITS WEBBED FEET TO LIKE PUSH WATER THAT HELP MAKES IT SWIM AND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES SO BASICALLY CHOMP THE MEAT AND BREAK IT DOWN TO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOPLE GET LIKE IT'S BASICALLY SHOWING LIKE ANOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU KNOW
Line_83	GOOD
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE BECAUSE UM THERE'S TONS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP TONS OF LITTLE SYSTEMS THAT MAKE UP ONE HUGE SYSTEM
Line_85	A CAR COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF A WAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO OUR SCIENCE UM OUR SCIENCE SCIENCE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE UM THERE'S A MOTOR AND LIKE WHEELS AND STUFF AND TONS OF STUFF THAT MAKE IT A BIG SYSTEM
Line_86	UM THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE EXHAUST AND THAT JUST LETS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEED IN THE CAR UH AND AND THE WHEELS AND THE WHEELS ARE WHAT MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_87	IT'S A HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SYSTEMS LIKE YOUR MUSCLES AND YOUR HEART AND YOUR LUNGS AND UM IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOMETHING
Line_88	IF UM IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW LIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HEART IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS US MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STOMACH
Line_89	THE EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SPHERES LIKE THE HYDROSPHERE THE GEOSPHERE AND UM THE BIOSPHERE AND THE HYDROSPHERE AND THE ATMOSPHERE BUT UM SO THOSE LITTLE UM SUBSYSTEMS THEY MAKE UP ONE BIG SYSTEMS CALLED EARTH
Line_90	YES I DO THINK IT'S A SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE'S THE HYDROSPHERE AND THE GEOSPHERE AND THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE BIOSPHERE AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG SYSTEM
Line_91	OKAY THE BIOSPHERE IS UM THE LIFE OH AND LIKE THE TREES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND UM THE HYDROSPHERE IS THE WATER AND WE AND THE BIOSPHERE NEEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND UM THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKY AND SO UM AND THEN THE GEOSPHERE IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEED THE GEOSPHERE THE UM THE BIOSPHERE NEEDS THE GEOSPHERE SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE GEOSPHERE NEEDS THE HYDROSPHERE UM AND THE BIOSPHERE NEEDS THE ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE WE NEED SOME OF THE AIR THAT'S UP THERE AND THE HYDROGEN OR WHATEVER THE STUFF WE BREATHE AND UM WE NEED THE HYDROSPHERE BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD PART OF THE BIOSPHERE AND THE TREES THAT'S ALSO BIOSPHERE AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE GEOSPHERE I CAN SEE THE SKY WHICH IS THE OR NOT HYDRA ATMOSPHERE AND THEN THE WATER RIGHT ON AROUND THE BOTTOM UM IT'S THE HYDROSPHERE
Line_93	THE EARTH
Line_94	THERE ARE FOUR SYSTEMS THE FIRST ONE IS THE HYDROSPHERE AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECOND ONE'S THE GEOSPHERE AND THAT'S THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BIOSPHERE AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE AND TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOSPHERE WAIT NO THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS LIKE THE SKY
Line_95	I SEE A LOT OF LIKE LIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES IN THAT ONE SPOT LIKE ANIMALS OR TREES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITHOUT THE WETLANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STUFF UM THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WETLANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HABITAT SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAIR TO THE ANIMALS
Line_97	THERE'S LIKE UH FORESTS AND STUFF WHICH BEARS USUALLY LIVE IN THERE'S LIKE TUNDRA WHICH IS LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACES PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HYDROSPHERE WASN'T HERE WITHOUT THE HYDROSPHERE WE WOULD NEED UM THE THE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS UM SNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE'S LIKE UM ANIMALS AND I THINK IT'S A FOOD WEB BECAUSE THERE'S THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND WHAT THE GRASS EATS AND UM THEN THERE'S LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOOD WEB
Line_99	A FOOD WEB
Line_100	WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT DOESN'T EAT ANYTHING AND JUST GETS IT'S ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THERE UM LIKE IT'S SHOW THE ARROWS MEAN WHAT EATS THAT ONE THING SO IT SORT OF JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DO IT LIKE IT SHOWS ME LIKE IF I HAVE A TEST OR SOMETHING AND IT SAID WHAT DOES THE BUNNY EAT I COULD LOOK AT A FOOD WEB AND IT SHOWS THAT BUNNIES EATS GRASS SO IT SHOWS IT SHOWS YOU WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE FUNGUS AND STUFF AND THE MOLES AND GRASS AND PINE CONES AND STUFF
Line_103	UM HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGUS UM FUNGUS EAT FUNGUS GETS EATEN BY PINE CONES AND PINE CONES PINE CONES GET EATEN BY BARK BEETLES AND THE BARK BEETLES GET EATEN BY BY THE SALAMANDER AND THEN THE SALAMANDER EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RABBIT AND AND THE RABBIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RABBIT ALSO GETS EATEN BY RED TAIL HAWKS AND UM AND SPARROWS ARE EATEN BY RED TAIL HAWKS SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST A BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT DOES IT EAT AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER COOL THINGS
Line_104	GOOD
Line_105	I'VE BEEN STUDYING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO IN THE DARK OR IN LIGHT
Line_106	THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING CAUSE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE SORT OF SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS AND SYSTEMS THAT'S SINCE SINCE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAT AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR YEAST IS DORMANT SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOOD IT WILL IT WILL BREATHE AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IN WILL POOF UP
Line_107	THE YEAST HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND THE YEAST ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO AND IT'S DORMANT SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SQUEEZE SOME WELL PUT ADD THOSE THREE THING TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN THE YEAST WILL WAKE UP AND IT'LL START BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL POOF UP
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BREATHING BECAUSE OF THOSE LITTLE DOTS IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BREATHE AND WHEN THEY BREATHE WHEREVER THEY ARE IF IT'S IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BAG WILL POOF UP SO IT'LL SHOW THAT THEY'RE BREATHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND IF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS IT'S FOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO GOBBLE UP ANIMALS SO SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT'S JUST A WAY MAYBE WE COULD SINCE IT'S A LIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS IT
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YELLOW AND SOON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SO IT SO IT WILL DIE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN SHINES ON THE PLANT AND THEN AND THEN SOMEONE'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THEN THE WATER AND THE SUN GIVES IT IT'S FOOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLY WELL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THEM MAKES IT SO THEY CAN MAKE SUGAR AND SUGAR IS THEIR FOOD
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN OR THE PLANT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE SOIL AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THE OR IF THE SUN GOES ONTO THE LEAF AND IT WILL ABSORB THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE SUGAR AND THAT'S IT'S FOOD
Line_115	I THINK THE PLANT NEEDS THAT I DON'T WELL I THINK THAT PLANT NEEDS THE AIR WELL ACTUALLY NO IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BREATHE AIR OH AND THE PLANT THE PLANT THE PLANT BREATHES OR SOMETHING BREATHES THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT I THAT WE BREATHE OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BREATHE THE AIR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BREATHE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND PLANTS NEED THE SUN TO SURVIVE BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUNLIGHT THEY WON'T THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THEM LOOK GREEN AND AND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SUGAR AND SUGAR IS THEIR FOOD
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLANTS PLANTS NEED SUN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN THEY CAN'T PRODUCE SUGAR AND IF THEY CAN'T PRODUCE SUGAR WHICH IS THEIR FOOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBURGER AND A HAMBURGER IS SOMETHING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEED BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND PLANTS DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	IF WE DON'T FEED IT FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BUT IF IT WASN'T MAKING IT'S OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED FERTILIZER BECAUSE FERTILIZER IS LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN AND WITHOUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NUTRIENTS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEED FERTILIZER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND I THINK PLANTS ARE GONNA NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE HAS USUALLY HAS A BACKYARD AND IF IT HAS A BACKYARD THAT MEANS THERE'S PROBABLY DIRT AND THAT SOMEWHERE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE FOOD
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE THEY IF IT RAINS THAT GIVES THEM WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S SUNNY IT GIVES THEM THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THEY'LL GET THE WATER AND PLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUNNY THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUN IT'S THE SUN GIVING OFF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANT GETTING SOME OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE IN AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE DIRT AND IT'S ROOTS AND IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREATHE
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DRINK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES IT IT GIVES IT IT'S FOOD BECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT IT USES THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BREATHES AND IT BRINGS OUT AND IT BREATHES OUT OXYGEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE BREATHE SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED CARBON DIOXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE AND WHEN WE SPEAK WE LET SOME OF OUR CARBON DIOXIDE OUT AND THEN THEY'LL PRODUCE OXYGEN FOR US
Line_130	THEY ABSORB THE SUNLIGHT AND THEY NEED THEIR CARBON DIOXIDE SO THAT THEY CAN BREATHE AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SUGAR AND THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY BREATHE OUT THE OXYGEN AND THAT'S THE STUFF WE BREATHE
Line_131	YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT OR THEN THEY MAKE THAT INTO FOOD AND THEN BREATHE OUT CARBON DIOXIDE AND THEN THE WATER IS JUST A WATER FOR THEM
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY NOT SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS AND PRODUCE SUGAR CAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT THE SUGAR SO IT'S DYING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN'T MAKE IT'S FOOD AND IF IT CAN'T MAKE THEN IT CAN'T REALLY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT IT WILL DIE
Line_134	NOT ENOUGH SUN
Line_135	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIND OR AIR AND WITHOUT THE WIND OR AIR IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATHE SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATHE IT'S JUST GONNA DIE
Line_136	IT CAN'T BREATHE SO IT DIES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVEL UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITHOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WE NEED WATER AND FOOD WATER FOOD AND OXYGEN TO SURVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OXYGEN AND THE WATER IT NEEDS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND IT CAN BREATHE SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	WHO HAS THREE PLANTS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE THREE OF THE THINGS IT REALLY NEEDED SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY LIVE THEY COULDN'T PRODUCE THE FOOD OR DRINK OR BREATHE THE OXYGEN THAT THEY NEED BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATHE THE OXYGEN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GONNA BE HEALTHIER THAN THOSE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT'S STARTS OUT AS WHAT EATS IT'S OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THAT'S AND IF IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOD
Line_142	LIKE MAPLE TREES OR MAPLE LEAVES WELL MAPLE LEAVES AND THEN THERE'S LIKE PARALLEL LEAVES AND THAT'S JUST LIKE THE VEINS AND THEN THERE'S THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WHERE THERE'S ONE MAIN VEIN AND THEN VEINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THEN MORE VEINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE'S ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VEIN AND THEN JUST A VEIN ONE VEIN COMES OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONE'S VEINS ARE PARALLEL THE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GO STRAIGHT THE ONE THERE'S ONE VEIN THAT GOES STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE'S AND THEN ONE HAS THERE'S MORE THAN LIKE ONE MAIN VEIN BECAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VEINS AND THEN THERE'S ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VEIN AND THEN ONE VEIN COMING OUT OF IT BUT THEN AT ALL DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE HAS JUST HAS A TON OF JUST A TON OF VEINS JUST GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER TWO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE'S SOMETIMES THERE'LL BE MORE COMING OUT OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE ONE WHERE IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE BUT THEN IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANY MORE EXCEPT FOR THAT
Line_145	ONE ONE OF THE THINGS IS A A PARALLEL IS PARALLEL AND THEN THE OTHER TWO AREN'T AND THEY AND THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE BIT PARALLEL BUT THEN IT THERE'S ONE MAIN VEIN AND THEN IN ONE AND THEN A FEW OTHER VEINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VEIN BUT THEN NOTHING COMING OUT OF THE OTHER VEINS AND THEN THERE'S ONE WITH WITH NOT WITH MORE THAN ONE MAIN VEIN SO THAT MENS THAT THERE'S MORE VEINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT IS PINNATE IS KIND OF LIKE A FEATHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VEIN AND VEINS COMING AND VEINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN VEIN BUT THEN NO VEINS COMING OUT OF THOSE ONES THAT AREN'T THE MAIN VEIN AND THEN PALMATE IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A TON OF VEINS ALL OVER SO THERE'S AND THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MAIN VEIN SO THAT MEANS THERE'S EXTRA VEINS AND THEN PARALLEL IS JUST A TON OF PARALLEL VEINS
Line_147	THIS IS THE THIS IS THE THIS IS THE PINNATE AND IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VEIN AND THEN MORE VEINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN VEIN
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES PRODUCES MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SUGAR AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS OR AND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_149	TO CARRY SUGAR TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARRIES IT TO THE ROOTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROOTS CAN SEND IT UP AND MORE VEINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEINS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SUGAR TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE VEINS IN THE LEAVES HAVE ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKE THE SUGAR FROM THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT PIECE OF THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOOD SO THAT IT CAN FEED ITSELF AND EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEINS AND ONE IS CALLED THE PHLOEM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SUGAR TO THE PLANT AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE XYLEM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT BUT THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STAY IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP TOT HE REST OF THE PLANT THROUGH ONE VEIN AND I THINK THAT'S THE XYLEM AND THEN ALL THE NUTRIENTS AND SAP MAYBE AND SUGAR IS GOING THROUGH THE PHLOEM TO THE ROOTS
Line_154	IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES AND EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLOOD WOULD IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THE PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF AND EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE XYLEM IT PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT JUST LETS THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT MOIST BUT BECAUSE OF THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED INTO THE BAG BECAUSE THE PLANTS THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T RECIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANT IT JUST EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S WATER ON THAT
Line_158	BYE
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALSO KIND OF BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SYSTEMS AND HOW AND WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SKUNK IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND A TURTLE'S ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS THAT SORT OF THING
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEY'RE ALL COLORS AND SHAPES AND PROBABLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO CAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A A WARNING NOT TO EAT THAT ANIMAL OR SOMETHING
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IT'S PROBABLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO I THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL TURTLES THEY LIKE TO THEY THEY'RE UPON LAND SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTLES CAN AND THEY KIND OF CAMOUFLAGE CAMOUFLAGE SOMETIMES BUT YOU CAN SEE TURTLE LIKE TURTLE TURTLES THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTLES WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND STUFF SO THEY CAN SEE EACH OTHER AND THEN THE FISH ARE BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEAN DON'T EAT ME TO PREDATORS IN THE OCEAN OR THEY JUST FIND A MATE AND THEN SKUNKS THEY HAVE WHITE THEY'RE WHITE AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLY TO SHOW HEY DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR I'LL LEAVE STINK EVERYWHERE SO
Line_165	YES I DO
Line_166	THE ANIMALS DON'T WANT TO EAT THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED SO IT HELPS THE SKUNK STAY ALIVE
Line_167	ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHELL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP PREDATORS FROM GETTING INTO IT SO IT CAN HIDE IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDATORS CAN'T EAT IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO LIKE SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUE FEATHERS IF I SAW BLUE FEATHERS I'D BE ATTRACTED TO THAT AND AND THERE'S ALSO ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HEY I'M POISONOUS OR HEY I'M GOING TO IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GOING TO SPRAY YOU OR HEY YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I DON'T TASTE GOOD SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DUCK DIDN'T HAVE FEET WEBBED FEET IT COULD PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER IF IT COULDN'T PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO YEAH THE FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIONS DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BE GUM AND WITHOUT AND WITHOUT THE TEETH THEY CAN'T EXACTLY GRAB AN ANTELOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IT WOULD JUST SMUSH IT A LITTLE BIT
Line_171	BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TEETH IT'S JUST GUM AND AND IT AND THE LION CAN'T BITE THINGS TO KILL IT SO THAT IT CAN EAT IT IF IT'S JUST GUM BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY SMUSH THE A LITTLE BIT IT'D BE LIKE YOU COVERING YOUR TEETH WITH YOUR LIPS ALMOST AND THEN BITING YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH AS IF YOU JUST BIT IT
Line_172	THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HAS A SPECIAL DESIGN THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT MIGHT EVEN LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EYE BUT THE BRIGHT COLORS MEAN HEY YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I'M POISONOUS EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT NOT BE POISONOUS
Line_173	RATTLESNAKES RATTLE THEIR TAIL WHEN SOMEONE OR SOMETHING GETS CLOSE BECAUSE THEN AND THEN THAT TELLS THEM HEY I'M HERE DON'T STEP ON ME OR I MIGHT BITE YOU
Line_174	WELL THE PERSON WALKED UP AND THEN THE THE RATTLESNAKE STARTED SHAKING ITS TAIL AND BY SHAKING THE ITS TAIL THAT WARNED THE PERSON NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER BECAUSE THE SNAKE MIGHT STRIKE
Line_175	THE HUMAN KNOWS THAT IF IT GETS ANY CLOSER THE RATTLESNAKE WILL STRIKE AND BITE YOU AND IF IT BITES YOU IT PUTS POISON YOU SO THAT COULD KILL YOU ALMOST SO IF YOU HEAR THE SNAKES RATTLE IT'S TAIL THAT MEANS DON'T COME ANY CLOSER OR I'LL BITE YOU
Line_176	IF THE PERSON WALKS UP IT SHAKES ITS TAIL SO THE PERSON JUST STOPS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT TO GET BIT BECAUSE IF IT BITES OR SHE COULD DIE AND THAT KEEPS THE SNAKE SAFE BECAUSE IT DOES IT FOR ALL PREDATORS
Line_177	THAT COYOTE KNOWS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT THE SKUNK COULD SPRAY IT BECAUSE IT'S PUTTING UP ITS TAIL AND IT HAS THE WHITE AND THE BLACK STRIPES SO THE COYOTE KNOWS TO STAY AWAY OR ELSE IT'S GOING TO GET SPRAYED AND IT'S GOING TO STINK FOR DAYS
Line_178	WELL THE BIRDS ARE FLYING THE DOG IS CATCHING SOMETHING SO LIKE IF YOU THROW A FRISBEE THE DOG KNOWS HE WANTS TO CATCH IT SO HE CAN PLAY WITH AND BIRDS IF IT GETS COLD THEY KNOW TO MIGRATE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE OF SOMEONE GOING TO THE DOCTOR AND IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND ON SOMETHING HOT YOU HAVE TO YOU PULL IT AWAY VERY VERY FAST BECAUSE IT HURTS

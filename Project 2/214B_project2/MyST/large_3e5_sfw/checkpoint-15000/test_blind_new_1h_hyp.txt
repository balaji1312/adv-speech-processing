Line_12	IT SHOWES ME LIKE A FOX A BUNNEY A HUMAN A BIRD U LIKE BG A FLOWER LIKE MUTING GRASS OR LIKE I THINK THAT'S LIKE A MOUN
Line_13	A FOOD W
Line_14	IT IS WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS COULD GET EATAN BY LIKE AN ANIMALS FOD AN ANIMALS CREDTR  LIKE LIKE SOS O A BUNNY RABIT IS LIKE FOOD FOR A SNAE A HOCK AND LIKE A LIKE A MUSHGROUM IS MUHNS YATHERS MUSHGROUMS AND THE LISERD THERE IS LIKE VACTERIA GRASS BACTERIOUS FOOD FOR THE GRASS
Line_15	CAN YOU REPET THAT
Line_16	BACTERIA IS A D COMPOSER SOME FUNGY IS A D COMPOSER AND GRASS IS A PRODUCER
Line_17	BIYIE
Line_18	POIN YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WOILD LIKE THE PLANT PLANS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MUNKIE AND THE HAOUCK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ARE   THE BACTERIA AND A FUNGI IS ARE LIKE TO CANTHE D COMPOSERS
Line_20	I PRODUCE MY OWN BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS HAT'S MEAN TO ME  IF O WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY OL ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FROUA
Line_21	IIR LIKE HAVE MY OWN FOD LIKE NE FROM AN ANIMAL LIKE LIKE SO LETS SAY IF I WERERE WEILLE SOMETHING LIKE HAIR I WOULD EAT FOD LIKE GRASS SOMETHING LIVING AND BI ONE OF MY PREDETORS WOULD BE LIKE A HOCK
Line_22	A D COMPOSER D CANT LIKE D COMPOSERS THERE WON'T FOE LIKE A LIKE BROUGHT IN FOOED OR LIKE PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_23	TDE COMPOSING ROT AND FOUD AND THE FOUD THAT THEY D COMPOSED GAVE THEM ENERGY
Line_24	SOME WILL SOME STUFF LIKE MAYB FONGIE IM BAGATERIEA
Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PIXTURES O A DECOMOF DCOMPOSIERS PRODUCERES AND CONSUMARS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WELL WE LIKE DOERD THE MORE AND KIND OF LIKE ONVE THE TOP THE FOUOCHIANIGHTS ING
Line_27	ON THE VR I THINK IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANT LIKE U AND SEE LIKE BERIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A ON ER EATS ALL WELL SO IF ME IS THE PREEFIXTS OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO OUN DVRZSE ARE ANIMALS THAT EATS ALL THINGS LIKE MEAT FROUTS AND VEGCTABLES
Line_29	A KIND OF WAR

Line_38	WWHEN YOU HA TOLD ALOGA
Line_39	SOME ARE
Line_40	I'L ACTUALLY NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS THIS ONE THING IT HELPS THA MAKE WATER
Line_41	BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS A LIVING THINGS AND IT NEEDS WATER N THEN YOU AN JUST ICK ORN TO STOP IT AND THEN TBULB
Line_42	YES BECAUSE IT IS A BRGAR  ARE A THINK DE COMPOSARS WHICH THEY NEAD THIS KINDY DID NOT DE COMPOSEN BUT THEY NEAD FUD LIKE BERGARS
Line_43	THAT PLAN'S FI ING
Line_44	WHAT
Line_45	NO
Line_46	NO BECAUSE PLANS USE FIRTDALIZER UTHEY DON'T HAVE TO USE IT
Line_47	YOUSE
Line_48	IT NEADS WIND IT NEADES SOIALE IT NEADES SUN AND IT NEADES THOSE IMPORTANT STUFF
Line_49	BANNY CARBON DINOGSIDE IN OCSIGION AND WHI IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT HELPS THESERVIVE AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE LIKE A PRAUN
Line_50	THEIRE LEAVES
Line_51	H WINND IT DOESN'T GET WATER NOR WIND NOR AOAIN NOR CARPLON SIDE  WALSLY THAT'S ONLY JUST WHAT ITS LIKE WHEN IT GETS WATER AWHEND
Line_52	IT IS ALSO DYING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE LAST ONE BUT IT IS NOT GEATTING ANY WATER AND THON'T L LIKE IT ALSO NEEDS THAT MATERIAL AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY WATER A GANALL LIVE AND LIKE I SAID PROCEEDE IT'S LIGFE

Line_77	IT OUT AMBLES AND HOW THEY GET RACTY AND I MOST OF THE SIYSTOM AND HOWVE THEI GET NOTICED
Line_78	STRIES I SEE LIKE HACON SHAPES AND ISE LIKE LCKAS FROIDES  GRIPES
Line_79	DISMELL
Line_80	IT USES IT'S WEBED FEETS TO UHM LIKE PUSH WATER THAT MAKES IT SWIN HAND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES HOP BACICALLY CHUMP THE MEATE AND BRAKE IT DOWN TO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOUPLE GUESS LIKE  IT SBACICALLY SHOWING IT UN LIKE THE ANNOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU NO
Line_83	GOD
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS TUNDS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP WHAT ONE TENS OF LITTLE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONES HUGE SISTOM
Line_85	E CARE COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF AWAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO OUR SCIENCE PL OUR SCIENCE SCIENCE RANA BECAUSE THERE IS A MOTOR AND LIKE WEELS AND STUFF AND UN STUFF THAT MAKES IT A BIG STICITIUM
Line_86	THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE ZS THEN THAT JUST LETS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEAED IN THE CAR AND THE WEALS AND THE WEALS ARE WHAT MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_87	IT HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SISTOMS LIKE YOUR MUSLES AND YOUR HEART IN YOUR LARMS AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOMETHIN
Line_88	IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BE OF WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOWLIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE WE WOULD'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HEART IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOUOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS THIS MIXTURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STOUMICK
Line_89	THE ERTH IS A SIYSTM IT'S BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SFEERS LIKE THE HIDR SFEER THE GEEO SFEER AND THE BIO FER AND THE HIDRU AND THE ATMOUS FERE BUT UM THE'S ARE THOSE LITTL UM SUBE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE VBEAG SISTOM CALLED ERTH
Line_90	YES I DO THINK IT'S A SISTOM BECAUSE THERE IS THE HIDROSFER AND THE GEO SFER AND THE ATMAOSFER AND THE BIRO SFERE AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG STNO
Line_91	OA THE BIRO SFEER IS THE LIGT AND THEN H AND LIKE THE TREES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND THE HIDRA SFEERE IS THE WATER AND WE AND THE BIRO SFEER NEAEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND THE ATMAUSS FEER IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKI SOAND THEN THE GEO SFEERE IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEAED THE GEO STHATTHE BIO SFEERE NEAEDS THE GEEO SFEERE SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE BIRO SFERE NEAEDS THE HIDRA SFEERE WAND THE BIRO SFERE NEEDS THE ATMAUS FER BECAUSE WE NEAEDS SOME OF THE AIR THATS UP THERE AND THE HIDRZM P WHATEVER THESTUF BE BREETH AND WE NEAED THE HIDRA SFEER BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES OUSUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD BE PURT OF THE BIRO SFER AND THE TREES THAT'S ALSO BY SFEER AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE DEO SFER I CAN SEE THE SKI WHICH IEST THE HIGHS NOT HIGHJ ATMOU FER AND THEN THE WATER RIGHT OM ON THE BOTTOM  ITS THE HIGDRABS SFEER
Line_93	THE ERTH
Line_94	THERE ARE ORCOMES THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIDRA SFERE AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECONT ONES THE DERO SFEERE AND TLEST'S THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BIO SFERE AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE IN TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOUS FEERE WI NOGH THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOUS FEERE WHICH IS LIKE THE SGI
Line_95	I SEE A LOT OF LIKE WIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES AND THAT ONES SPOT LIKE ANIMOLS OR TREES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITH OUT THE WET LANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER AND WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STUFF THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WET LANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HAPE TA SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAR TO THE ANIMALS
Line_97	THERE IS LIKE FORIS AND STUFF WHICH BERS USUALLY LIVE IN THERE IS LIKE TUNDRES WHICH UST LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACE IS HOT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HI DRESOFEER WASN'T HERE BECAUSE  THAT THE HI DRESFEER WE WOULD NEED HE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS SOSNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE IS LIKE UM ANIMALS AND I THINK'S A FOODWAB BECAUS THERE IS THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND THE BT THE GRASS EETS AND THEN THERE IS LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOODWAB
Line_99	FOOBLAD A FOD WEAB
Line_100	WHAT EATS WI AND WH WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATS W AND WHAT DOESN'T EATS ANY THING AND IJUST GUETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THEYRRE LIKE IT THE AROWS MEAN WHATS EATS THAT ONE THIN SOSORT OF JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DOIT LIKE IT SHOWS ME LIKE IF I HAD LIKE A ESTE OR SOMETHING AND IT SAD WHAT DOES THE BUNNEY EAT I COULD OOK AT A FOODWAMB AND IT SHOWS THAT FUNNIES EAT GRAS SO IT SHOWS IT SHOWS YOU WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE FUNG IS STUFF IN THE MLES AND GRASLING PINCONS AND STUFF
Line_103	HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGIS FUNGIS E WEI FUNGITS GETS EATEN BY PIGN CONS AND PINGLBS GET PIN CONES GET EATENBY THE BARK BEETLES AND THE BARK BEETLES GET EAN BY THE BY BY THE SALMANTOR AND THEN THE SALIMENTORS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RAB AND THE AND THE RABIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RABIT ALSO GETS EATEN BY HOT RED TAILE HOCKS AND THEAND SPERROS ARE EATEN BY RETAIL HOCKS SO IT'S SPACICALLY JUST A BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS WI AND WHAT DOES IT WE AND ALL SORCE OF OTER COUE THINGERS
Line_104	UN
Line_105	I'VE BEEN STUDYING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO IN THE DARK OR IN THE LIGHT
Line_106	UM THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BECAUSE EST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE CERTAON LIV WORK SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS AND SISTOMS THATS SINCE SINCE ESTE IS A LIVING THING WHEND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN EARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAT AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR A ESTE  STORMANT SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOD IT WILL IT'LL BRETH  AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IT WILT PROOF UP
Line_107	U THE ESE ET HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND THE EASE ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO UAND IT'S DORMANT SO IF YOU AD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SCREESE WILL PUT AT THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN  THE EASE WILL WAIK UP AND  IT'LL STOP BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL POOF
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BREETHING BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE DOSAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BREETH AND WHEN THEY BREETH WHEREVER THEY ARE IF ITS IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BATDLE POOF UP CLS SOW THAT THEY'RE BREETHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND IF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS HIS FOD BECAUSE WE KOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO BOBBLE UP ANIMAMS SO MAY SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT WE WOULD MAYBE WE COULD WELL SICE A SOLIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YEALOW AND SON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN SO IT WILL HAVE SO ITWILL DIVE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN M SHINES ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE  THEN SOMEANE'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THE A THEN THE WATER AND THE SUN ANGIVES IT IT'S FOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLY WELL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER HELP AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THE MAKES IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SHOOGER AND SHOGER IS THEIR FOED
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN  THE POINT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NEW TRANCH FROM THE SOILE AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THIS RH  THE SUN GOES ON TO THE LEAF  AND IT 'LL OBSORB THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE M SHOGER AND THAT'S A FOD
Line_115	UM I THINK THE PLANT MNEANDS THAT I DON'T NOW YEA I THINK THAT PLANT NEAEDS THE AIR BECAUSE WELL ACTUALLY KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND UM I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BREETH AIR O AND THE PLANS THE PLAN THE PLANS HANT  BREETHS OR SOMETHING BREETHS THE CARBON DIOCIDE TAT IBRIN THAT WE BREETH OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BREETHE THE AIR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BREETH THE CARBONDIOCXSIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND EPLANT S NEED THE SUN TO SERVIVE BECAUSE WITH OUT THE SUNIGT THEY WON'T BE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THE LOOK GREEN AND AND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SHOGER AND SHOGER IS LIKE THEIR FOD
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBUM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLANT PLANTS NEEDS SN BECAUSE WITH OUT THE SUN THEY CAN PRODUCE SHOGER AND IF THEY CAN PRODUCE SHIOIGER WHICH ISE THEIR FOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBERGER AND A HAMBERGER IS SOMETHING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEDBECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND THEY DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	UM IF WE DON'T FEED I FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLUM  UM IF IT WASN'T MAKING IT'S OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLUM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED A FIRTALISER BECAUSE FIRTALISER IT'S LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN IT WITH OUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE AND THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NEW TRANTS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEAD A FERTALISER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND THE I THINK PLANTS ARE GOING TO NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE HS USUALLY HAS A BACK YARD AND IF IT HAS A BACK YARD THAT MEANS THER 'S PROBABLY DIRT AND THAT'S SOMEWERE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE FOOD
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE THAT IF IT RANS THAT GIVES THE WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S SUNY THAT IT GIVES THEM THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THE'LL GET THE WATER AND THE PLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUNDY THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUNIT'S THE SUN GIVING OFF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANS GETTING FROM THE COVER DOCSIDE N AND NEW TRAN FROM THE DIRT IN ITS REUTS AND IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREETH
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DRINK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES I IT GIVES ITITS FOUD BECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH FOTO SIMPHECIS AND THE CARBOND OCSIDE IT IT USES THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BREETHS AND IT BRINGS OUT AS IT BREETHS OUT OCSIGION AND THAT'S WHAT WE BREETH SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED  O COME DI OCSIDE CARBON DI OCSIDE AND WHEN WE SPEAK WE LET SOME  OUR CARBON DI OCSIDE OUT AND THEND THEY'LL PRODUCE OCXSIGIN FOR US
Line_130	THEY OBSORBED THE SUMIGHT AND THEY NEAD THEIR COVERN OCSIDES SO THAT THEY CAN BREETH AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SHOGER AND THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY REED OUT THE OCIGEN AND THAT'S THE STUFF WE BREETH
Line_131	YES UTHEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THAT INSOME FOOD AND THEN THEY BREEH THE M THE ACSIDE AND THEN THE WATERS JUST THE WATER THROUGH THEM
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY NU SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS IN PRODUCE SHOOGAER BECAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT THE SHOGER SO IT'S DIING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN MAKE IT'S FOOD N IF I  CANT MAKE IT'S FOOD THEN IT CAN REALLY UM IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EETEN IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TO TH ANYTHING TO  CAN EAT IT'LL DIVE
Line_134	NOT ANOUH SOID
Line_135	UM IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIND OR AIR AND WITHOUT THE WINT OR AIR IT  DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREETH SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH IT'S JUST GOING TO DIVE
Line_136	IT CAN BREETH SO IT DIVES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVEL UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITH HOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAIN WE NEED WATER AND FO WATER FOUD AND A OCIGON TO TO SERVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIVE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OCIGEN AND THE WATER IT NEADS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOGH WATER AND IT CAN BREETH SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	WHO HAS THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THROUGH THE THINGS IT NEEDED SO THAT SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY DI THEY COULDN'T REALLY PRODUCE THEIR FOUD OR DRINK OR BREATH THE OCIGIN THAT THEY NEAD BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATH THE OCIGIN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GOIN BE HELTHIER THAN THOSTE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT STARTS OUT AS WHAT EATS IT'S OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER EAT MAKES IT'S ON FOOD  THAT  AND IF IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOD
Line_142	LIKE MAPBLE TREES R MAP BELIEAVES MAPBELEAEVES AND THEN THERE IS LIKE PARALLEL LEAVES AND THAT'S JUST LIKE THE VANS AND THEN THERE IS THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WEL THERE 'S ONE VAIN VAIN AN THEN VAINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THEN MORE VAINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THENT JUSTVAIN ONE VAIN COMING OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONES VANS ARE PARALLEL THE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GO STRAIGHT THE ONE THERE'S ONE VAIN THAT GOS STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS AND THEN ONE HAS THERE I'S MORE THAN LIKE ONE VAIN VAIGN BECAUSE THEN THERE IS MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE I'S ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN ONE VAIN COMING OUT OF  BUT IN ALL DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE HS JUST M HAS A TUN JUST A TUN OF THE VAIN'S GOING STRAIT AND THEN THE OTHER TO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS SOMETIMES THEREWILL BE MORE COMING OUTOF THE ONES THET ARE GOING  ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE ONE WHE'RE JUST GOS STRAIGHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN HERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANYMORE EXCEPT FOR THAT
Line_145	ON ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PARALLEL IS PARALLEL UM AND THEN E OTHER TWO ARNT AND THEY JAND THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE BUT PARALLEL BUT UM THEN IT THERE IS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN  IN ONE AND THEN A FEW OTHER VAINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VAIN BUT THEN NOTHING COMING OUT WORT THE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE WITH THE UM NOT WITH THE MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAIN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS MORE VAINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	U THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS PINEITE U IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FETHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THINGS COMING AND VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN THING BUT THAT NO VAIN'S COMING OUT THOSE ONES THAT ARNT THE MAIN THING AND THEN PALMATE IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A TUN OF VANS ALL OVER SO THERE IS AND THERE IT'S MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEAN'S THERE IS AEXTRA VAINS AND THEN PARALLEL IS JUST A TURNAL PARALLEL N VANS
Line_147	THIS IS THE THIS IS THE THIS IS THE PINNENTAND IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VAINE AND THEN MORE VAIN'S COMING OUT THAT ONE MAY BEY
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TAPES BELEVES  PRODUCES MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SHOGER AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS R AND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_149	TO CARRY SHIOGER TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARIES IT TO THE ROUTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROUTS CAN SENDIT UP AND MORE VAINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE BET ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TIPES OF VANS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SHOGER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE VBANS IN THE LEAVES HOW ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKE THE SHOGER FROM THE FOTOR SIMTHCIC ANDT ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT BEUS O THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOD AND SO THAT IT CAN REED ITSELF IN EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK IT SHOWING THAT THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT TIPES OF VAINE AND ONE IS CALLED THE POLUM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SHOGER TO THE PLANTS AND THE THE OTHER ONE IS ZILM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT BUT THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STK IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP TO THE REST OF THE PLANTS THROUGH ONE VAN AND I THINK THAT'S THIS ILUM AND THEN ALL THE NEW TREENTS AND SAPMAYB AND SHOOGER IS GOING THROUGH THE THE FOLUM UM TOGH THE ROUTES
Line_154	IT HAS TO DO WITH THO YOU'VE BEEN C TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLUOD WOOD IT IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PITPLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THAT PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF IT EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE ZI T PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT JUST LESS THE WATER E EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT WAISE BUBECAUSE IN THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED  INTO THE VG BECAUSE  THE PLANT S UM THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T REACIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANT IT JUST  EVAPORATES INSTEADAND THAT'S WHY THERE IS WATER ON THAT
Line_158	BIE
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALSO KIND OF BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SISTOMS AND HOW WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SCUMNC IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND MITURNALS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND SORT OF
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COLORS AND SHAPES AND PROBABLY DIFFERENT SISTOMS ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE  MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAN COLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A WARNING NOT TO EAT THAT ANIMAL OR SOMETIN
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IS PROBABABLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO I THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS IT'S WHAT THEY'R ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL  TURTALS THEY LIKE TO THEY UM THEY'RE UP ON LAMS SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTALS CAN UM AND THEY KIND OF CAMFLS AMFLSE SOMETIMES BUT UM YOU CAN   TURTALE LIKE TURTAL WEL TERTALS THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER U AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTALES WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND SOBSITE'T CAN SEE EACH OTHER U AND THEN THE FISH ARE REALLY BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEANS DON'T EAT ME TO CRES AND THE OATION OR THEY JUST WANT TO FIND THE MAITS AND THEN SCUMS THEY HAVE WHIGHT THEIR WHIGHT AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLU TO SHOW HA DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR ILL LE'VE STICK EVERYWHEARE SO
Line_165	YES I DO
Line_166	UM P THE ANIMALS DON'T WAN TO EAT THE SCUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED SO THAT HELPS THE SCUNK STAK ALIVE
Line_167	OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHEL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP CREDITORS FROM GETTING INTO ITSO IT CAN HIGHT IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDITORS CAN'T EET IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO IKE SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUEE FETHERS AH IF I SAW BLUE FETHERS THIT BE ATCCRIP ATTRACTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ALL SORS ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HA I'M POISONESS OR HAIH A MITLT IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GONG TO SPRY YOU OR A YOU DON'T WANTO EAT ME I DON'T TAST GOOD SOMET LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DUCK DIDN'T HAVE FEAET WEBED FEET IT COULDN'T PADDL THROUGH THE WATER AND IF IT COULDN'T PADDL THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO YEAH THE FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTAN'T PART
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIEN'S DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BEGUM AND WITHOUT IT AND WITHOUT THE TEETH IT THEY CAN EXACTLY LIKE GRA AND ANTILOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD JUST KIND TOF SMOTE IT A LITTLE BD
Line_171	BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TEETH IT'S JUST GM AND AND IT AND A LI CAN'T BIGHT THINGS TO KILL IT SO THAT IT CAN EAT IT IT WHAS JUST GUM BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY SMOCH THE SKEENG ALITTLE BIT IT BE LIKE YOU COVERING YOUR TEETH WITH THE MEOUR LIPS ALMOST UM THEN BIGHNING YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T HEART AS MUCH AS IF YOU JUST BIT IT

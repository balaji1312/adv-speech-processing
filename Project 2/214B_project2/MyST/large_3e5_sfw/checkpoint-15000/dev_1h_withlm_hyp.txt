Line_0	I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CANNETIC ENERGIES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DIVICE OR LIGHT BULBS SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK I NEVER MIND
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_7	CANNETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THE
Line_10	JONNEGRIIVITL SIDE
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COAL
Line_14	ARY OSOMBNIS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW WILL THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_16	IT'S THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT A FALL COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THIS THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY OBSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE IS A IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUM AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUNS TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPPINING IS IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY
Line_25	WE METAL OR A COPPER OR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUNKY STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE RULER IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE PA THE PUTS LOW WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT WE JUST ESTABLISHED THAT
Line_30	MADE OF MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE INMADE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	LITERS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL M L
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CON CONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND THAT SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAXIS MIL
Line_38	A WIT WHICH IS THE THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANY THING
Line_40	IS BURNING AND FLAMING AT
Line_41	USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WIN GOING ON A HATRACT BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	ON JUST PRODUCING OFF GIVING GET ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HERE SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT OTHERS
Line_44	THERE ALL WAS WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	WILL BURN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS A SOLAR POWER CA
Line_47	IT WILL COME PUT THE SUN TO THE SOL POWDER TO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THAT TRANSFERING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	O CA TOWN WE SCKIP THIS
Line_49	NONE REUSE THE BLOW
Line_50	I IS ONLY THE ONE TIME USE AND COAL IS JUST AND COAL IT IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BUT LONG TIME
Line_51	THERY WILL NOT SCIING YA I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	CIRCUITS AND WELL CIRCUIT
Line_54	I THINK THAT M BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS A FLOCUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGHE AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAD IT COULDN'T
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RATICAL WAY
Line_59	BRIGHTER OR BE ER TO COMPLCATE IT
Line_60	THAT'S I DO NOT KNOW A LEVER
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SID
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THEN D IS FLOWING AN IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	EL KAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN T
Line_65	IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
Line_66	THE NO S N
Line_67	NO
Line_68	BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPERCONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	UH I DON'T NO
Line_73	SORRY AND BISY AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIMES WITH THE
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BISY REALLY BISY YE
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE LIST SA
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINIMAL WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS OLUMINIM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END
Line_78	THE I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE LET ME HURRY UP
Line_79	STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS
Line_80	I'M COLOARBLONE I'M A COLOR BLIND SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH IT'S GREY
Line_81	MATALICK ETTUMS
Line_82	THEY ARE VERY METICK AND VERY MATALICK
Line_83	MAGNETS
Line_84	THEY WOULD REPEL OBVIOUS LE
Line_85	UH I
Line_86	IT SELLS AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
Line_87	THEY ARE SIMILAR BE IT DO NEVER MIND CAN WE MOVE ON
Line_88	SOME ARE REPELLING AND SOME ARE ATTRACTING THE END END THE STORY I LEARN THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Line_89	A PERSON WITH THE COMPASS
Line_90	BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET
Line_91	IT IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_92	BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
Line_93	BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUT THE IT POLES AND POLES ATTRACT
Line_94	MAGNET IT IT'S HARD FOR MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS STICK
Line_95	IT IS NOT STICKING
Line_96	BECAUSE WE LEARN THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_97	THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
Line_98	METAL AND MAGNETISM
Line_99	ON A MAGNET
Line_100	MAGNETISM
Line_101	IT WOULD AND NOT BE MAGNETISM THAT NO MORE LONGER STUFF
Line_102	UH NOT VARING MUCH
Line_103	MAGNETISM

Line_133	UTILY DID SHOW PLOPARE TEN
Line_134	RAPIDIS CHEESE
Line_135	A THING
Line_136	I'M GOOD TO DAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT PORTS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	THEY'RE WIRES AND THEY TRAP THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UM TO LIGHT THE BATTERY DIDN'T KNOW TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY AND A CIRCUIT BUL
Line_141	THEY TRANSFOR THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMES INTO LIGHT ER
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IT'S GETTING STUCK BY THE PO
Line_146	THE ENERGY TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BOTH WEIGHED EVEN THOU THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCHED
Line_149	I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASING AND THE BULB CA
Line_151	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES
Line_152	GYTHE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE MOTOR
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED FROM SORD ENERGY TO CONNETIC ENERGY
Line_155	THERE COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	THE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BORD
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECT ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FASING THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SO SHELLS COLLECT
Line_165	WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T A
Line_167	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THERE IT ISWHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT THE
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THINGS
Line_171	A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
Line_172	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
Line_173	ALL METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_174	ALL OF THE METALS AND THE LIST ARE CONDUCT ARE TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_175	ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_176	THE CIRCUIT RUNS
Line_177	I MAKE A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_178	ALL ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_179	A CIRCUIT WITH THE INSULATOR INSULATES ELECTRICITY THEREFORE THE INSULATOR THAT THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RISE
Line_180	INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METALS THERE FOR THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_181	THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_182	WHEN I ADD IT INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
Line_183	CLOSED
Line_184	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_185	THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
Line_186	GOOD
Line_187	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HOU EN ENERGY IS PRESANT
Line_188	IT IT POWERS THINGS LIKES TOSTLEY AND AND COMPUTORS
Line_189	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE WAX MELTING
Line_190	THE CANDLE MOUTS
Line_191	IT FELT VERY HOT
Line_192	THEY HAD NO SOUND
Line_193	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES
Line_194	IT POWERES Y EVERYTHING FROM FAR TO TOSTERS
Line_195	I SEE THE CAL BURNING AND THE MAXWELL MELTING
Line_196	THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THEREFORE THE AX IS MELTING
Line_197	THERE IS NO SOUND
Line_198	SINCE THE PERSON IS PITTING THEIR HANDS UNRUMS IS MAKING SOUND
Line_199	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THEREFORE SHE'LL NEED ENERGY FROM THE APPLE TO EAT
Line_200	CANDLE APPLES WOOD IT STICKS GOT IN THE FIELD
Line_201	IT GETS BLACK AND FOLGY

Line_219	Y THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MANY MORE WIRES STEAR FOR THE ENERGY WILL LS
Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRES
Line_221	COURSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES
Line_222	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE IT POLES
Line_224	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_225	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_226	THE SIMLARITY OF MAGNETS THAT ATTRACT EACH OTHER ARE THAT THEY'RE NO
Line_227	ERTHS MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_228	THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT A COMPASS THAT USES THE ERTHS MAGNETIC POLES
Line_229	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND OTHER STUFF
Line_230	WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND MAGNET FIELDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_231	THE MAGNETIC FIELDS GOING THROUGH A PAPER THERE OR MAKING THE PAPER CLIP THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE MAG

Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTOR
Line_263	THEY ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND A WIRE
Line_264	IS HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER
Line_265	IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THERE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFOR AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILLMENT AND THEIR GETS SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_277	SENT THE ELECTRAMS FLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICED THE ELECTRUNS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_279	WELL WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULBWILS STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT PLINTS WOULD NOT YET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN IT OFF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	INS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IS HAPPENING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THAT THE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSFER ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT PEE
Line_289	BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW CAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUNLIGHT IS HITTING THE SULAR SELL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	AND MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR FOR TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS STRONG AS NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	MIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SOME AR CONDUCTORS UM ARE INSULATE
Line_306	ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UM IF YOU PUT AN INSULATORUM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE POPSICAL IT DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	SULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE A LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	OR STOPS RUNNING
Line_313	THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY FLING LIKE A PATHWAY
Line_314	ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS INTO MOTION OR LIGHT OR SAL
Line_315	YET CANDLE BURNING SEAT
Line_316	BURNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO SEE WAX MELTING
Line_317	SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHINGS CAN SISL
Line_318	THE HEAT IS MIDING FROM THE THE WIT AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
Line_319	IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF SHEET AND MAKING LIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A BUMER SOME CAN ANOISE THAT THAT SEES ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE DRUM TO MAKE IT RELIEACE A SOUND
Line_322	WHILE THE PERSONS BURNING CALORIE IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_323	WOOD GAS FED AND CANDLE
Line_324	IT WILL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND THEN EVEN WATER
Line_325	LEA IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENT LEASE FROM
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I AM NOT SURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUT DOR THINGS
Line_330	THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CRILLY SMOG
Line_331	THEY POLLUTE THE ERTH WHILE SOLAR PANELS DO NOT POLLETE THE ERTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLO
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONMENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRUNS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUE DUS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT AN M THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE POWER TO WET THE ENERGY SLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FACE THE THE SAME POLITARY
Line_344	YOU PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSIT
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WAIGHS AND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEM FLOWS IN TWO WEIGHS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND THE TWO BULB
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED AND THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS RIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BAT THEN THE EL ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY IN AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE THE S
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BURNS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF UM THE FILAMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILLAMENT IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TWO
Line_368	A FILMENT BRAKES AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWT STOPS
Line_370	THE BEFILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FROM ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	JUST PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORK BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN EASILY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAR AND AND IT STAYS ON
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNED WHICH IS LIKE AN OPENS
Line_375	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IN THE PATHWAYS
Line_376	WELL UM
Line_377	FILLMENT BROKE SO UM SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S A SERIES
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILLMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRPLACUIT LIKE AN OPEN SWIT
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARN HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S EITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	OKAY SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT OR AND AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO WILL NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DOS
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT IT IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	LIGHTING CETS ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ONE TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A RACK
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPELL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THE BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPASS SHOWING NORTH ON THE ERTH
Line_402	SOME ONE USING A COMPASS TO FIG WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FOLLOWS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTAD METAL THAT IS STEEP INSIDE THE ERTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRO
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OP POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TWO THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE MAG PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THE LEAN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZE EVERYTHING HAS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BRAKING WITH WAIT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN STAFF
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FOR US BECAUSE IT IS TO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BRAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WAIT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AW
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKENS THE MAGNETIC
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACE ERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	IT IT MAKES THE FOR WEA
Line_427	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANC
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACE
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAKE THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WRAP THE CORD WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZES THE COAL
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETTING COT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAIN EDGE BECAUSE ELECTRO MAGNETS USE A TUN OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIEL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER
Line_438	IT MAGNETIZES THE COARL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COIL TO MAGNETISE IT
Line_440	THE THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL TO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETISE THE THE RIVER
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	THIS THESE ARE WIRES
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
Line_448	IT IS THE SORD
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNEXT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	THE WIRES ARE A PATHERY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRE
Line_455	THERE IS CARRYING ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY LIGHT THE USE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES FLOWER BULB LIGHT
Line_458	ITHIS
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	TIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SID
Line_461	IT'S THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUMP ON IT
Line_462	THE LECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE A CLOSING TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FORMED IN THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRITHE FLO GOES THE OTHER WAY
Line_466	UH JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOES
Line_467	TRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE U THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN RUNNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY END IT SPIN
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	I DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH N THIS PIXTURE IS UP AND
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT S THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOW IN
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR SETS RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL LOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR AS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THAT MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THE VERY THING I E
Line_489	I THINK THE SOL CELL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I TRICK ON IT AGAIN
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR STOP THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_492	A SOLAR SALT DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAD PANEL
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS STITTING
Line_498	THE NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPER CLIP BRIDGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPSICAL STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	ON MILTCHIE
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOP S
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSE I SAY IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WE BEEN UNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	THINK THAT UM THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE MAX THE WAX IS MELTED
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAXIS ME
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT
Line_517	I SEE A FLAME
Line_518	IT IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	UM SOME ONE IS DRAMING
Line_520	SHE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEAR T AND YE
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WA
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFF ME
Line_525	AIR GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	OCAY
Line_528	UM THE SOLAR SALTICLES THE CHER NOTE
Line_529	STUFF
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NOT RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTED
Line_532	UM THE COAL AND GAS PILL LETS THE AIR
Line_533	UM COIN GASS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	THE ELECTRICITY IS LOWING AND IT IS CLOS
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN'T STOP
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND A STAR CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BUT

Line_542	E BLUE DOT THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY THAT'S HOW THE ELECTRICITY W
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERY WAY UU
Line_544	ONE C
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WELL NEAD MORE WIRES
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHT TO
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT RIGHT
Line_548	IN THE THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHTS
Line_549	I SEE THAT
Line_550	THE Y H YOU ARE THE BEAUTIFUL MIST LADY IN THE WORLD
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	T ARE THOU
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULBS WELL WE BI
Line_556	ITS GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE HOW COULD PUT THE POSITIVE MOUNT THROUGH
Line_557	THAT IS VALLEY CERECTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES AND THROUGH THE POS THEY RUN OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THE S UGLY WEN
Line_559	THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THAT VERY QUITLE
Line_562	NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS U
Line_563	THEY ARE BRIT
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO TO ACTUALLY ONLY GOES LYING BY U
Line_565	THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RITE
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_570	IT THEY THERE ARE CHI LIGHTS IN THEM
Line_571	THERE IS ONE BULL THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BUL
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS ORM PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAY
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CASH WAY
Line_574	UH THEY ARE THE'RE UN POND FIFTY
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DAM
Line_576	I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHT
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS OUR DRIDE R YOU ARE THE DA W
Line_578	UM THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY A SALT
Line_579	THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOW IN
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE Y
Line_582	THE IT IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE MAGNET
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THEY WERE THEN
Line_584	I DO NOT ASHURE YOU SO PRITTY YOU SAY IT AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO HOLE HALF THE WEIGHTS AND THEY ARE GO
Line_586	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_587	IT LASSTS LONG
Line_588	ER UH TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICKLY
Line_590	UH THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM US
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHAR THE FAT WEN
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D CELL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND BOTH OF THEM
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEED A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT SO WE NEED THE POWRALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SERIES A SOURCUIT
Line_596	I AM GOHODED HOW ARE YOU MY BUT LED
Line_597	I'M FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND C THINGS OBVIOUSLY BULTH MORE AN SA
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE RAFIEGRAL WEIGHT TALL
Line_600	S THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
Line_601	THE NAIL THING IS STICKING ONTO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT'S INS MADE OF I MAYBE NOT
Line_603	WOOD YEAON PLASTIC YEAH
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL ON IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOES NOT ATTRAPT
Line_607	THEY BUS ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL DON'T YOU THINK THAT
Line_608	JE THEY ARE BUL MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_610	I TOLD YOU IN MAGNET STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OFF IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IRON THAND ONE STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL WIN THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO THE CAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LEARN TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FINE HOW ARE YOUOU
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COMPASSES
Line_623	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IT BECAUSE UM IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY ATE
Line_628	THE SAME SIDE ARE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPASS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND A SOUTH SAY A ON ERTH A NOISFUL IN A SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASED
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRITTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY DO STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THEY CAN NOT GO THE ONE DON'T LET GO
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL NECK A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	SI DON'T KNOW
Line_642	H IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	CAUSE BECAUSE IT IS N'T THE NAIL I MEAN IT ISN'T THE BATHNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BLOW STUFF MEAN THAT IT HAS
Line_646	I DO NOT NO
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	I'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MMOVING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_650	BUT HIVE THERE ISN'T ENOUF CAR
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON BE SIDE THEN THE MAKES UP
Line_652	THERE ARE WASHES NO THE'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO INTO THE B CUP
Line_654	UM THAT YOU CAN'T PUT THE SPACERS
Line_655	IT MOVES THE MAGNET FORCE ME WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENS THE FORIST
Line_657	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_658	IT PUSH IN PO HA WA
Line_659	YOU PUT SPACE THE
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND LE
Line_662	WELL IT MAKES THE THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_663	GOOD
Line_664	WEIVE AND SAN HOW A LITTLE RIRIVETS AND PICK UP WASHER
Line_665	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WILL S CLOWD OR NOT
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE IT'S SHOW FILL HERE
Line_671	IT'S BIO NOWALECAY
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MAN
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	THERE IS LALS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	OUTS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
Line_676	ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVET MAKE A MAGNAN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_677	I CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THING AND YOU COULDN'T PECKLSTOFP
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT JUST ROLE IN THE STEEL YET
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BILLY IN TIM
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN UM WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN'T
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE A ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_687	THEY HAVE TO U
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVIT
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
Line_691	THEN IT CAN BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROME TO HEAT UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU ARE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CAN THAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK
Line_697	WITH OUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD UM NOT LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_698	THAT IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY A ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTE
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE WHAT YOU NEED ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND ONE AND OF THE
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRIELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WITH IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHT IT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVERRALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE BLUE BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT VULVING GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS OR BULBS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO GO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	IT HAD THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE NOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR A THAT ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	LIGHT REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU DIS TACH ON THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ONE THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BA CELS IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NO BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE ENERGY FROM THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATTERY
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY AS THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW ON THE WAY
Line_714	IT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING BUSEMENT AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WELL LEARN ABOUT YESTERD
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCHIT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WEIY AROUND IT TO THE BOOT
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY COULD WORK THE SUNS ENERGY AND TENERELECTRICITY THAT YOU COULD NE
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WORE IT WOULD NOT TERNTHISS THE SUNS IT
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET IT
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREWL
Line_727	ONE IS A SCREW AND IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PA PAPER CLIP IS COMPLETING THIS CIRCUIT
Line_729	CTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRAVE STICK IS MAKING DIFFERENT SO IT'S STILL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRAP STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT OBSORBS ALL OF IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR OR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY ARE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS WHAT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT STEAL IN NOT COMPLETING
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARAL RA PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	FOR ABLE THE LIGHT BUMBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUIT CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A CLIP COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	WE THE THE LIGHT BUBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY BY GOING THE DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GOING ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOOD CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	COMES FROM THE PCOMPRA AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE YOU WEIGHT NO POSITIVE SID
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING OR THE D CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT I CAN BULB ON THE OTHR
Line_751	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEMSELVES THAT'S HARDLY BEEN USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHEAR A PATHWAY AND IT'S A LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BUBS HAD ARE HELP USE SOME THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY S
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL A VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING M
Line_754	YOU OH GOOD
Line_755	THEY'RE THEY'RE NORMALLY USED AT CRISMESS TO DECORATE MESS TREES AND HOUSES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRINGS BURNOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT ITS
Line_758	A PARALL A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF A BULB DOES AT THE WHOLE LIKE THE WHOLE THING GOES OUT ENOUGH TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB THUS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULB WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL I BOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE OTHER BULBS SAY ARE AND THAT ONES STANDING WHEN THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHER S BURN
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEY'RE GOING IN ALL THE IN AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST OF EM ST LIGHT
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILLMEND IN THE FILAMENT IN THE BULB WITH THE FILL HAS BROKEN
Line_769	SELLIMET IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT'S FIN
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RING BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR CAS THE THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YARN COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL SCAR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK ISN'T E REMOVE
Line_777	AND STEEL ONLY IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE
Line_778	IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BUCK HAS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOOD BLUCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULLS IT TO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TEN AND THE OTHER ONE'S MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_783	IT WILL STICK CAUSE IT HAS TRACES OF ELECTIRON
Line_784	THE HU BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK THE BLACK RO
Line_785	IT WEALL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR A STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIP
Line_786	THERE'S IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON TEST RE INFORICSE
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD SAPPATRACTING AND THEY WOULD REAP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PLUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE IT QUICK THE OTHER MAGNET I JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OVAL ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES RIPL
Line_791	ING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE'S USING A COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE'S GOING IT RIGHT NOW SHE'S GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE ERTH NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT STEEKS PREVINETS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY INTER RACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRYENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECT
Line_797	MAGNETISM ONLY HAS A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BEOND THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TWO IT'S TWO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO BIG STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM BUT IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	SO IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW WHEN IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY ARE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONES
Line_802	IT'S A IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHEN IT COMES OFF IT THEN NAIL STOPS BEING A MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU OU WHEN YOU DRINK THE THE MAGNET POFFIT STOPS DOING A MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_807	TAKE THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	TEA MAGNETISM
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SOLECT STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH SUCH STICK THAT STACK
Line_814	DEALING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
Line_815	A BAG NIT
Line_816	UH THERE IS ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISM BRAKES BECAUSE IT IT'S TO STRONG O THE WAIT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY ID ANOTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THE MAGNETISM ONES WEAKER LED THROUGH THAT THROUGH THOSE SPACERS
Line_819	IT MUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIGHT T
Line_820	THE BARLTES SAW MAGNET TOIZIELAM BO
Line_821	I GOOD NO TIS UM
Line_822	MIX IT WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER WEA
Line_823	BULLET
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DCREASES IT
Line_826	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC PULL WEAKER
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT IT STOPS READING ELECTRIELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM T DISAPPEARES
Line_831	MISS A D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH IS A RIVET WIRES UH THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT WORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE THE THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE MIDDAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGNETISM GETS
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE COVERING A MOTOR IS ONLY IT HAS TO BE FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND CIRCLES TIL IT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH ESILLY CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IT CAN'T BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED MAYBE IT MAGNIFIED
Line_840	SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT'S MAGNETID UP TO THE THE RIVET
Line_842	AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY IN O MAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON A STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THE IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO THE MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	IT MEANS
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THEIR CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOL SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_864	SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SMOK
Line_865	THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BCAUSETHER'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TOO MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO IF ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	THE ENERGY WON'T THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VOICE OCEAN
Line_875	I AM WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_877	IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING CAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKE IT
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE A FILM BLM BLM BLM BLM BLM
Line_883	THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DELICIOUS
Line_884	THERE WILL BE SMOKE OR STEM
Line_885	IT GETS FALGEY OR SMOKEY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I'VE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_889	I'M NOT SURE COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCUI
Line_894	UM SORRY UM THERE IS ONE D CELL A TWO BULB
Line_895	ITS SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GO GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	IT'S FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AMAGAS DO NOT GET THE CONSEP
Line_900	OH UM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK IN
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS OLING ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THE IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT HONE IT'S AND THE BASE AND THE CASING THEN IT'S THERE OCAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT YEAH
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARN THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IR
Line_905	THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE ITS MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY WEAR THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	DOES IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES WHY ELSE WOULD IT STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METALOALE
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SCIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE APPOEN
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THAT'S IT'S NORTH THE SOUTH OR SOUTH THE NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXCEPT FOR THE BOOM THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLD
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPASS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS PICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHR
Line_930	IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY SIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY SICK THEN IT CAN'T
Line_932	UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	THERE'S UM THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THE PA
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	IT TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	IT AS THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHELL THE NAIL IS ON THERE ON MEAN WHILE THE MAGNET'S ON THERE
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFORING INTO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT'S
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION IT'S TO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WELL WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROK THE MAGNETIC
Line_947	THERE ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SIX PACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER IT'LL CLICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER AND HERE'S MORE SPACE THAN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEAK R
Line_952	UM YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MIXES THE FORCE WEAK ER THE FORCE IN BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU IN FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT HE
Line_956	I SEE CANDLE MY PHANCE IT'S IN THE FIRE
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING EAH I'M NOT SHURE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_958	UH IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	THE FIRE BURNING IS PROOF THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRINGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUTOF METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_964	REFRIGERATE DOES THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON IMPOSSIBLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS UH STEEL NAIL WAS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THEY ARE BOTH MADE AS STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WIE ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	IT THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PR HOW PR AS LIKE METAL ON THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INSIDE
Line_971	THE IRON AND OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIM
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNEY
Line_974	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THE WIRE BO THE LIGHT
Line_976	WIRE BATTERY AND A LA
Line_977	THE WIRES LIKE THEY MAKE UP ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FOM ANOTHER UM S
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WIRE UM UM CAR
Line_980	IT PROVIDES UM HOW THE
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKES A UM
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WATER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_983	IT WILL SET OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL UM UM T
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CA ELECTRICITY SO UM THE LIGHT BULB A LI
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITYES HO THE BATTERIES CAN THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECEIVING THE THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE EGY FROM THE
Line_988	IT'S FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO T
Line_989	THE PART THAT THE ENERGY IS FULL OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS REPROZEUM THE ELECTRICIT
Line_991	IT SLIPED OVER SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU SLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BAT
Line_994	THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE UM UM ONE OF THE WIRES UM CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULB LIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BUG BY UM THE D CELL
Line_997	THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BACK TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY DOES TO BREAK THE BATTERY BRINGS ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTIVE FROM THE W
Line_999	CAN YOU REPEATED THAT IT
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PIXTURE IS SO LIKE IT BURNED IT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTOR IS UM SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLO BING
Line_1003	I NOTICE THAT UM THE UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM IT SPENDSE AND UM
Line_1004	IT CAN YOU REPECKE THOU IT
Line_1005	UH IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FOWING TO THE MOTOR YET BUT WHEN I CLOSE IT IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T MOVE OR IT DOESN'T MAKE THE ELECTRICITY UM FLOW TO THE MOTOR MY CORRECT
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GO GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLLIT POWDER IS COLLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD E
Line_1009	WON'T BRING ELECTRICITY IN TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIN
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPANS THE
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO UM COMPLETE MOST A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDAL PO
Line_1013	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1014	AH
Line_1015	I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARTS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	O KAY BYE MONEY WELL IT'S THAT YOUR NEA
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	WELL WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME ABOUT H HOW I'M FEELING
Line_1020	UH YOU JUST MEAN I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES DO SO ON LIGHT BULB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SID
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHARGER LIKE TRICKS AND HAVE LI
Line_1026	I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE UM FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DOES UN LIKE ANYTHING JUST WHAT S
Line_1029	I COULD SEE THAT THE HEAT ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAH A
Line_1030	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGIN
Line_1031	WE UM ACTUALLY DOING PARTY GOOD
Line_1032	UH WE IT'S BEEN DOING UM POW
Line_1033	IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOTS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UH CAN WE PEE THAT AGAIN
Line_1036	UH CAN YOU BEAT THAT POLEIECE
Line_1037	THERE IS WE UM SOLMENT
Line_1038	THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AS THE TIME YOU ADD MORE D CELL
Line_1040	UM ONE BATTERY ONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D CEL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU HAVE A PON EDGE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECT TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE HAVE A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUITS
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NO
Line_1047	IT
Line_1048	IT'S IT'S JUST THE USE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY UM WON'T WILL DUN
Line_1050	THEY SERVE YOU LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO LIGHT
Line_1051	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINES SINE
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWES IN THE UM PLUS SIGN AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS CEL
Line_1055	MOLECULES OR ELECTRICITY BULLS LIKE MITTAL BULLS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKY HEAPS OM FINE
Line_1057	THE MINES SINE
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MARNEY
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T START IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	EITHER WAY YOU CLICK ONE WIRE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TU
Line_1062	I WAS BILDING A CIRCUIT STILL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND INTO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND THAT IT IS ON AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE PATTERYWET
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NOW RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT MEXTD TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS LEARNING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT'S WELL METAL AND IT IT'S LIKE ELECTRIC FLYING TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	IT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I CLICK IT IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE THE FLAG AS TO FLOWING ITS AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEX GUMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PANEL AND MA IT IN THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WOULDN'T SERVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S ON
Line_1080	IT TREES SETS OFF IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOTHING IS HAPPENING
Line_1084	DO TWO MOREIES STEER LATER HAVE A GOOD DID TO BY
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
Line_1087	ELECTRIUM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD WORKBUT
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING A L JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT WON'T IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTICK IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD RIGHT THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTE IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTICK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THE CONDUCTORS ARE THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICKED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTOR START RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND A SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE THE HEAT AND THE ES MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGHT AND IT TO PORVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE YOU STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE THE PLASTICK AND IT'S SOUNDAN
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALL SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAON
Line_1111	APPLES
Line_1112	THE FIEEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE WILL BE SWEAT
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE HOT AND SMOKE COMES FILLS THE AIR
Line_1115	THE SOLID PONEL
Line_1116	GAS WOOD WINDMILS SOLAD ANIEALS
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BULB SIRVED ENERGY
Line_1118	WE BOTH ENERGY INUM AND THE BOTH SERVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BUL AR FEUWAL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SERMEN THEY JUST GET SMOKE AND THE GASS MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_1121	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLOW PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GASS DOESERT
Line_1123	THEY SERVE AS MEAT AND WILL VIEW IN BREETH
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE FLIGHT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IS LIGHTING UP
Line_1127	THEY'RE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILLMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW ANYWHARE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT WILL WORK LIKE A SWITCH OLTHOST CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	OH IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET CAR
Line_1134	THEY BUB THEY ONE GETS RIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN UM CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLICKED IT AGAIN THEY STOPPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FASING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	UH I HAVE BEEN DOING UM A LOT OF STUFF UH MUGNETS
Line_1140	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONSEARNING EVERGY
Line_1143	I ONLY KNOW A MOMENT NOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FILL MAN
Line_1145	UM HOW WELL I KNO
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE BATTERIES A MID THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERIY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON SIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FORE WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT OH AN INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRES
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
Line_1160	STRINGS OF LIGHTS ARE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1161	IT'S KINO LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE BAR THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DINE
Line_1163	WIERES IN A BATTERY AND UP
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEGL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DING
Line_1166	THE FILLAMENT DIE
Line_1167	THE FILLMENT DIED ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILMAN DIES AND THE WEIGHT IN THE WEIGHT
Line_1169	A FILLMEAN DING ON A BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDESENT CIRCUITS AND I CAN REMEMBER THE REST
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILMENT ISN'T DYING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILMENT BREAKES AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS MO
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINE SIGNE AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AN IN COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	IT THE FILLAMENT IS DING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT ST
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDESCENT CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW YOU
Line_1180	I MEAN SO WELL NOT LA MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH SO THERE ARE NOT TO BE OPOSIT SO LIKE CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE ATTRACTING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	BECAUSE IT'S STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	ONE OF THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THEN NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WHO ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL AMPE THES IT
Line_1187	BECBECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD IS NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL FIT WELL FIT IN AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS A LOT OF TWOOMBS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TO
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	T STON
Line_1198	THESE ARE MAGNET THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNET THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT ALL STOPS AND IT DOES FALL AND IT DOLL FULL
Line_1205	NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BILD UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED THAT HAVE ALL THE SURPLISE I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	I NEED WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETS THREE WIRES AND A BATTE
Line_1209	FLIES AND BE THE A
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIE
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVIT STOPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPED AND THE MAGNET
Line_1212	UM A YEAR
Line_1213	OPEN BEING CLOSED
Line_1214	THE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNETS BY THE RIVET
Line_1215	THAT TRICCITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGEIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	RE AND MIRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BATTERY AND THE MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB OM
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS THE THE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT TURN
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOKED TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GO THROUGH
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1226	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE WHAT'S RECEIVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BACK
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL TOWARDS THE THE POS THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE
Line_1231	I WAS ABSENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PANELS AND HOW ING A SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING FRICTION AND HEAT AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR AND MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICE THAT ALL THE PIECES ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	ININSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTIC AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS TER INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS CONDUCT
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRIC
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND EL ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORK AND WITHOUT ENERGY IT NOTHING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS E
Line_1242	YEAH YOU HEAR A LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TYPE OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BURNING
Line_1245	WHEN YOU PUT THE HANDS POD ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EACH WHO IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOODS SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALN
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEAR A NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRLS EATING AND ESCAPING HER ENERGY SO THAT SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PULLS THE AIR THE AIR GETS ALL DIRTY AND NOT GOOD YOU FOR YOU TO BREETHE IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKY
Line_1252	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STORIT
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COAL ARE SOMERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND GLASS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THE
Line_1255	COAL AND DA WOULD HAVE A BAD EFECT ON THE VIRAN BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BRING
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW A THAT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TIPES OF THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	THE ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FROM THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVEMENTL ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1262	THE DOTS MOVING REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE IS ONE PATH THE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIES SE
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH
Line_1265	BYE MORE
Line_1266	VERY WELL HOW ABOUT
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE IS TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ON
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOWE GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
Line_1274	THE END IN THE BATTERY WHERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES IT JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE SE OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULBING GOES INTO THE POSITIV
Line_1276	I NOTICE THAT THE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS
Line_1277	A YOU UH HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BULB WIRES AND WIRES AND AND THE BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY HIGH THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOURCE IS THE SAME DI
Line_1281	WELL IT'S THE SAME THIN
Line_1282	ENERGY
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHITE D
Line_1284	WILL THE LITE UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THIS WIG THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT UP AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE GO ON IT
Line_1286	KITTY CALLED AGAIN
Line_1287	IT IS GOING TO THE LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING ICED THE SAME
Line_1289	THEY ARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENTLY
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST Y AND THEN IT CHARNGES YELLOW SO IT CHARN
Line_1291	LOOK AT C NEXT
Line_1292	WE HAVE BEEN DOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GOIN
Line_1293	WELL THE GREY EK IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATT
Line_1294	IT IS A A BECAUSE MOTOR I THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE ABOUND INNER
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DON'T THAT
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE IN ENERGY FROM THE BATT
Line_1300	THE THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1301	THE FLAG TARTS MOVING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN IT'LL START THE FLAG WILL ST
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH IT'S THE WIRE THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG AT
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DO YET
Line_1306	THE GREEN PEACE WITH IT SUNNY
Line_1307	WELL CAN A CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU CLICK THE SUN
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVIN
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS WALKING THE FLAG STEPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UM
Line_1312	I SEE THE FLAG MOVE IN
Line_1313	THE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTE
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THES MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THE UM WIRE AND THE SWIT
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSE
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE SO THE STICK
Line_1319	IT IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	OH I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WE ARE LEARNING TH
Line_1321	OH CA SO THE PLASTICK
Line_1322	THE STEEL MEAT THE STEEL U
Line_1323	YOU TWO BYE MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUIT
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND ITS TOUCHING THE WIRES AND THE FLAG IS LONG BY THE ARE
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND ROUND AN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH AND THE WIRE
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT IS TO METAL
Line_1329	IT STOPS UM IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UH SO
Line_1331	YOU'RE MARNEY
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANNEL AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STICK PLAIN IT'S GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MELK THE CAN
Line_1334	BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREETH
Line_1335	IT MOUNTS CAUSE OF THE FIRE IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT WE CAN SO THAT IT'S IRONY
Line_1337	NO I COULD NOT SA THAT THING
Line_1338	IT WAS A SOLVENT IT WAS FIRE
Line_1339	IN THE CAKE OF THE ENERGY OFF BEWEI
Line_1340	IT MAKES SOUND SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	EH
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GAS BOBLE APPLES AND O FIRE
Line_1343	MEAL WIRE APPLE WOOD BLACK STUFF AND A A
Line_1344	IT GOES ON IT ON
Line_1345	THE SOLPI WE USE Y AND S
Line_1346	I YET
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT IS
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN LARKING MAGNETI
Line_1349	UH THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STRAHT ONE IS HEURVED AND THE ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	THEY T'S CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIUR REFRIGERATOR
Line_1352	WELL IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERAT HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE MATIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNIC AND SO THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAG
Line_1354	WELL THAT THIS THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE R
Line_1355	THEY IS TO GO BECAUSE THAT I UH THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MAGN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE THIS GREW
Line_1357	WELL A TRACHICIDY DOUSE BUT A GATDOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IN
Line_1359	DOUBLE BEANS
Line_1360	BECUSH IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1364	BECAUSE WHAT HAS IRON IT DOESN'T
Line_1365	I
Line_1366	IT WILL YEAH
Line_1367	ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A
Line_1369	THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WAIST THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL AND THE PLUS SIT
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO ITS NORMAL SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSHE
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE I EACH END
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MAVING IT'S LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN NOT PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IS STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE ITS LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK NEED METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF TRICITY FOR A PIECE OF AND NO JE
Line_1381	ILL IN SIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
Line_1382	INSULATORS ARE ARE HELPFUL
Line_1383	IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ENERGY
Line_1384	SO
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN THEY REPEETE THAT
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT ITS MELTING
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND DROP I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
Line_1390	IT'S HEADING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING TO
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUT YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOCUICED UM THE SOUNDS AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HER FEAT
Line_1393	UM IT SHE IS GETTING IN TA ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS S
Line_1394	THE APPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PEN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE GAS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	FROM BECAUSE THE COAL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE GASS HAS INT I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MOUNT THE ERTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREES AND EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT A REMRULO
Line_1400	IT IS A COMPLETE TORMAT OR A LIGHT BULBED WORK
Line_1401	WELL UM I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BUMB LIGHTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOR THERE IS FORE PATHWAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	H I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO UM D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORT OF ENERGY SO IT WOULD WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK THE WORK MAYBE
Line_1405	E MEAN C YOU HURRIED UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLAS OF THE WIRES AND THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS STWORD AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES IS A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR A S AND WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UH I PO
Line_1413	THAT WHEN THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE
Line_1414	TILL THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE I'M SEEN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1416	MADDY WE COULD SWITCH IT FOR A NE ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT'S THE BATTERY
Line_1418	D BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHILE YOU ARE TALKING AND I'M SICK
Line_1419	UM STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	WOULD A STRIGA LIGHT SE PARTY
Line_1421	WIRES HOLD LIKE ENERGY AND STUFF
Line_1422	WELL IT WON'T WORK MOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE THE ENERGY IS WHOLD BAT
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALREADY DRYGED OUT IN STUFF
Line_1424	U I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SAY THE WAR
Line_1426	OH MARD AND CAN I PLEASE JUST FI YOU
Line_1427	I BUM BROKE AND THAT THE W
Line_1428	IT WON'T BRROKE SO IT DIDN'T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO CHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER
Line_1429	WE SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PEE
Line_1430	WON'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S STUDDED IT'S THE WORK
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THAT ELECTRICITY GO ON THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UM IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE
Line_1433	FRO GA IT DOESN'T LIGHT ANDY WORK
Line_1434	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERYE
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A CUPLE OF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO E
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO LEARN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GO THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP FLOW POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING TRUE
Line_1440	POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASH LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO WHOLD IN YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEIVES POWER AND FROM THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND NEVER M
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO TO
Line_1445	UM WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN AND DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S I DIDN'T INVENT ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN SEE THE PICTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MO
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING US POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIR
Line_1453	AN SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	UM TH THE PERSON WHO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER SORCE POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN FOR
Line_1460	ITALE HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
Line_1461	WHENEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
Line_1462	SH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHT WAY
Line_1463	UM WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT THEM MEA BECAUSE THE PAT THE WE GOT THE LEIDE BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS
Line_1466	WE ARE TRYING TO MIKE SHURE CAPES OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_1467	SWITCH AND ME A WOMEN A NAIL IN R
Line_1468	UH D CELL THE ARUBIUM THE OLD SLITCHED METAL AND OR
Line_1469	THE SWITCH THE METAL
Line_1470	UM WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METAL IS MAKING
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	THERE'S NOTHING REALLY ELS TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST WHO
Line_1473	IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOW
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND WE
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS THE LIGHT BETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF T
Line_1477	THE FLAME GLARES OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_1478	IT BURNS THE WAX IT MELTS
Line_1479	IT'S SOUNDED CAN T LIKE POPPING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOMEBODY'S HEATING THE BONGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENER
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRYING AND THAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DUSC A FAN TREE BRANCHES RAISINS AND FIELD
Line_1483	IT GIVES MORE AIR BECAUSE OF THE THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE COULD THE FIRE COULD PULL EACH AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT EFFECTS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S NONE AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HI
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY OLD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A FAN AN THE MOR
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH OURSELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR UM IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	UM THE FRONT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINES
Line_1494	THOSE ARE THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND THE
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FILL THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF IT GETS STUCK IT WORK
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS AR DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHT ARE I
Line_1497	IT WILL GET REALLY LIGHT AND WEIGH
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAY BE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNS BATTERIES HOT REALLY QUIT
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICKS THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHER
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE ON BOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRIGH
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERIES SERIES CIRCUITS HAVE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE SHIRT
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT LIGHTS THE BULB WHEN I THINK THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE C
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE WIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILM BRAKES IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYMORE
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREAK
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS TOPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STICKS O
Line_1513	THERE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1514	NOTHING HAPPENS BCAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO T
Line_1515	BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHEN ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CIRCUIT SOR IT CAN FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
Line_1516	TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER LIGHT YOU'RE TRYING TO POWER UP
Line_1517	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL GOING UH TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWURE IT UP AND BACKS THROUGH THE REAR END OF THE D
Line_1518	FOR ENERGY TO GO DIRECTLY TO A LIGHT BULB AND MAKE IT LIGH
Line_1519	THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE BATTERY BACK TO THE NEGATIVE SI
Line_1520	THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIMALLE PATHWAYS IN THIS CEENORY ES AND INSTEAD OF AN
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER BOTH THE LIGHT
Line_1522	I DON'T EAT KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BE THAT THAT DON'T
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT W
Line_1528	THAT THE D CELLS SO DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY
Line_1529	BYE
Line_1530	THEY'RE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ENDS EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT'S SHAPE LIKE A DOT
Line_1531	WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH GO ON TO EACH OTHER THEY CONNECT WBUT IF NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH TRY TO CONNECT IT WON'T WORK
Line_1532	UM IT'S ALL ONE BIG SIDE
Line_1533	THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THEY'RE ALL ON THEIR END
Line_1534	A STEEL A STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DONAT BRING MAGN
Line_1535	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MAGNETIC

Line_1539	THE ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A MAGNET THAT ISN'T A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT WILL STICK TO A MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
Line_1540	IT HAS TO BE EITHER METAL OR IRON
Line_1541	IT'S MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED IN STEEL
Line_1542	I THINK THEY HAS SOME KIND OF WAR IN IT
Line_1543	OR AND IRON
Line_1544	THAT THERE IS ONLY
Line_1545	THAT THEY'RE ARE BOTH LIGHTING
Line_1546	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE ONES ON THE THE ONE ON THE
Line_1547	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT MORE OR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO I DON'T
Line_1548	THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE I U WOOD LIGHT
Line_1549	THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS TO POWERS THEM UP AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D
Line_1550	THAT THEY ARE POWERING UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1551	THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_1552	ONE WILL EAT TWO
Line_1553	THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB IS KEEPS BURNING OUT
Line_1554	THAT THERE ARE UHM MORE THAN ONE D CELL
Line_1555	THAT THEY ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_1556	THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THERE ARE JUST
Line_1557	THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT LIGHTING AND
Line_1558	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE CIRCUIT
Line_1559	THAT SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY OF ONE PATHWAY
Line_1560	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONE
Line_1561	THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1562	THAT THE BULBS ARE BURNING OUT
Line_1563	THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1564	THAT OF FILLEMENT IS BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT
Line_1565	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1566	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1567	THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINIOW
Line_1568	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1569	THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THAT'LL WELL BURN OUT QUICKLY
Line_1570	THAT WHEN ONE FILLMENT BRAKES THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLE STILL CONTINW
Line_1571	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY OH
Line_1572	THAT THE FULMENT BRACE AND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING IT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
Line_1573	SERIOUS ITWAIGTES IT WEIGHTS TO HIT FULL
Line_1574	P THE UM FILLOW MIGHT BREAK
Line_1575	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
Line_1576	ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
Line_1577	THAT THEY ARE A MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE A NORTH COLLE THEM SOUTH
Line_1578	THAT THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE IN THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE WILL BRAKE THEM APART
Line_1579	THAT THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FORCE BRINGS THEM TOGETHER
Line_1580	THAT BUT MAG THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
Line_1581	BECAUSE IT IS METAL AND IT'S STICKING TO THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF A MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THE NAIL
Line_1582	THAT IT IS METAL
Line_1583	WOOD GRASS DARK
Line_1584	THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NEIL WOOD UH STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1585	I DON'T N
Line_1586	BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT A METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT'S THE MAGNETS STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER OR OTHER WILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE STEEL OR ONE STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I DID
Line_1591	THAT IT TICKED
Line_1592	STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN U STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1593	THAT IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER IT CAN NOT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1594	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1595	STEEL OR METAL OR I
Line_1596	THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHEN IT COULD STICK AND NOT STICK ON TO THEM AND THEN NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
Line_1597	GOOD IT WOULD BE THAT
Line_1598	THEY HAVE OTHER METTALE IN THEM WHICH MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT TO
Line_1599	THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL IN T
Line_1600	THAT THEY'RE MAGNET AND CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1601	THAT'S THE MAGNET MAGNET MAGNET I DON'T KNOW
Line_1602	THAT ONE STACK IS BIGGER THAN ANOTHER SO THE MAGNET CAN GO ONE OR THE OTHER
Line_1603	ICOARL
Line_1604	THAT THE MAGNET CAN NOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET SO THAT STICK OF PAPER
Line_1605	THAT'S A MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE UM MAGNET
Line_1606	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE AND IT WILL IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THEN TELL THE MAGNET GETS TAKING OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIVE FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS ON
Line_1611	WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	MA WHEN IT GETS STOOD NINETEEN WASHERS AND BACKED IT TO UM BRAKE
Line_1613	THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	THE SPACERS WE'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY DIFFERENTS ARE NEED TO TAKE TH
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FOR IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER
Line_1619	IT TOOK NINE SPACERS TO BRING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO RAPPIT AROUND THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1622	THAT THE WIRES WRAP WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIBET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE IT LIKE WELL STICK TO THE RIB
Line_1623	SO PRODUCES ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRIES LIKE MAGNETISM FORCE SO IT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METTL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET I CAN CARRY METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THAT THE ELECTRIELECTRO MAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IT IS NOT AN ELECTRO MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IS THE ELECTRO MAGNET COULD IT IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS CLOSED
Line_1631	IT STARTS TO PICK UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSE
Line_1633	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	WE WRAPPED AROUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGN
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BUL
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT ALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELP UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TOLD TO USE
Line_1639	UM I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE UM IT'S A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BUL
Line_1640	UM I THINK WHAT TRAVELS AND WIRES IS ENERGY TO TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROUME OR ANY THING THAT NEEDS LIGHT AND DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGHT CAN YOU REPEETE THAT PLEESE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINUS SIGNE BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I COULD THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVEN'T NO
Line_1645	GOMES OUT OF THE MINES SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLUS
Line_1646	I THINK THE PLUDOCTS REPRESENT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINUS SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONENT COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BY MARNEY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE GREAT HELP
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO THROUGH FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL IN INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES
Line_1652	ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MIKE THE MOTOR
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE M
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING T
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO A CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	UN IS GIVING THE CEL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SI
Line_1660	THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WASTE ENERGY AND WELL IT DOESN'T WASTE
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE CIRCLI
Line_1664	THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THE WIRES INTO THE TO MAKE THE FLAGS
Line_1665	YOU TWO MARNEY THANK YOU BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS BIN AROUND AND A
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE DIFFERENT STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTIV
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAIL
Line_1670	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN NOT
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE UM MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS WROCK IT IS NOT METAL SO IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_1674	THE THINGS OPEN MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWLING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MABY
Line_1677	CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE ANYTHING METAL THAT CARE CAN CREATE RO ENERGY OR ELECTRIC
Line_1679	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNING I HAD A REALLY GREAT TON
Line_1681	GOOD GOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1683	I HAVE THE DO OH I'V FORGOT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DON'T
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT
Line_1685	I FORGOT SOLVNTLY
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE COLDING THE ENERGY LIKE IT LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND FLAMING INTO EVERYTHING IT
Line_1688	IT'S FALLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT THE WEE
Line_1689	THE BLUE THOUGHTS OR THE UH ELECTTRICITY BABY
Line_1690	THEY CONNECT ME ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE IT THE LITER REMIND ME OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	ME PORTION IS THAT IT GOES ABSOLUTELY D CAIL AND GOES IN ACID LIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THAT'S METAL IN THE LIGHT
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THRO FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN A NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULD BE MORE MUD AND THE LIGHT UM LIGHT
Line_1695	U MORBLE BULBS UM MEANS LESS THAN LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILL RE AND THAT THE NOVLERY GOE
Line_1697	I THINK THAT MIGHT BULBS WOULD LIKE RIGHT T
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WITH ONE D CAIL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT THE ONE WILL DO THESE IS IS VERY VARY RUG
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL
Line_1700	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU A TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GUESS
Line_1702	AT THE SO DOTHOS IN I WILL MISS YOU
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT IS NOT ACTSLOWLY UM NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRES MEAT SPREAD YOUR LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	ARE DREAMING DON'T KNOW
Line_1707	I OH THINK THAT THE I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB LIL DIM
Line_1708	I NOTICED BEARS AND LOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE OR PATHWAYS MAYBE
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK UM IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	UM I REMEMBER THAT UM IT GOES OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SI
Line_1713	E I THINK IT IS SWOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE S
Line_1714	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHWAY
Line_1716	UM I DON'T IUILY
Line_1717	I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS MORE WIRE
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE I WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT UM ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	UM I SEE THAT TOP FORM WORK
Line_1721	IT THINKS THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT THIS ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S THEIR BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I AM LEARNING M
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT ON THE VITRZINGLY SO IT THE LABOR S NOT LIGHT
Line_1726	BECAUSE THE TWICH IS NOT PRODUCT HERMIT
Line_1727	UM I THINK THAT THEN THE BUB WILL NOT THE LIGHT YOU WON'
Line_1728	I BULL MAD UM DAY U UM
Line_1729	UM THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT LIKE AND UP FOR CUTRICAMATIC BULBS
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THAT THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LEULB IS NOT LIGHTING OF QUAR
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULMB NAY
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILLIMENT BRAKES THE BOTH TO THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT IT'S BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS LIGHTING BECAUSE THE ONE IS BROKE
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT BECAUSE IF THE FILM IS BROKE SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGH
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOP
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT COMES WHEN A BULB BRAKES IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FULL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	UM A PARALLEL MAR
Line_1738	UM WHENEVER ONE BRAKES THE OTHER IT'S THE LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HASE IT'S OWN WIRES
Line_1739	IN ORDER TO BULB WHATEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILLMENT BRAKES BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB ONE THE ENERGY COMPOLEATELY STOPS
Line_1741	UM I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER ONES STILL
Line_1742	THIS PICTURE HAS TO DO WITH A BULB BURNING UT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES SENSE
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH THE LIGHT WILL
Line_1744	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T
Line_1745	WHEN EVER ONE BULB BURNS THE OTHER ONE BREAKS OUT
Line_1746	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER A ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE FILLAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	WHENEVER THE FILLMENT BREAKES THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILLMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	UM I THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN LIGHT UM WIRE
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH ANT EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDE TH UM WHENEVER ONE FILAMENT BRAKES THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS
Line_1756	LECTRICITY STOPS THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I SAY I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT REALATES TO THE LOST WHEN I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILLMENT IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT SEEING
Line_1760	I THINK THE ELECTHA ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT BRAKES AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	UM I KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UM I KNOW THAT UM IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS THAT ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	IT THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	WHATEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANYTHING WITH IRON IN I
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRINGE IS EITHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IT ORDER FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY OVER MAY LOT STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL AND IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TIPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS ETHER'S FEUL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE EITHER MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERIES WIRE AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MAKE THE WOOD
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILLS LIGHT UP THE BUL
Line_1787	THAT ANYREATE IT VIRES TO LIGH
Line_1788	IT IT'S LIGHTING UP THE
Line_1789	YOORE
Line_1790	IT FLOWES BY IT HAS LOTS OF ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE VOULVE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT B AND THEN INTO THE FLO
Line_1794	IT'S MOVING TO THE MINES SWEIGH
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINES
Line_1797	IT'S GIVING LEAK OF ENERGY
Line_1798	TWO THREE
Line_1799	IT DOESN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	GIVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING POWER
Line_1802	IT
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN IT TURN ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER S
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SISTOM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOP
Line_1808	IT IT'S GOING AROUND THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT
Line_1809	LEARNING W
Line_1810	THE MOTORS MOVING
Line_1811	STRINNING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE THE W IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER IT IT INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT STICK
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SUNGE ON IT IT WILL NOT SPEND
Line_1814	D CELL WIRES MILLAR
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY IN
Line_1816	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T STICK
Line_1817	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T GIVE ENERGY
Line_1818	THE IT'S AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1819	THE SPUNGE IS HALF AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1820	THEY ARE DIFFERENT CAUSOM AR METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S METAL CELL UH THAT
Line_1822	IT FLOWED UH THAT WHEN YOU PUT METAL ON TO IT THE MOTOR WAS SORE
Line_1823	IT IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1824	IT WA HAPPENS IS THAT IT WON'T SNICR
Line_1825	THOUGH NOT THOSE SPIN COULD IT METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE CLOTHED THEY ARE MAKES CAN MALE
Line_1827	UH
Line_1828	YOU LIGHT A CANDLE LIP FROM
Line_1829	WE WE IT GOOD IS YOU HUH
Line_1830	IT'S A CANDLE AND IT'S REALLY SCIENCE BECAUSE
Line_1831	IT'S MELTING
Line_1832	BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ANY
Line_1833	IT
Line_1834	THE WIND
Line_1835	HEJEMS
Line_1836	SHE IS EVEING CAL FOIL
Line_1837	IT'S GIVING POUND HERE

Line_1842	YOU SEE A CANNL SOME
Line_1843	N APPALE
Line_1844	IT WILL GET THIRTY
Line_1845	IT GETS IT GIVES HEAT
Line_1846	I DON'T BLOW
Line_1847	GOING HEAT AND TREE
Line_1848	THE POLE
Line_1849	TWO
Line_1850	BECAUSE GAS WILL GIVE THE COAL ENERGY
Line_1851	BECAUSE BECAUSE IF ONE HAS AN TRAIN ONE DOESN'T
Line_1852	BUT WE I CAN NOT KNOW
Line_1853	HE DID NOT KNOW
Line_1854	FLEAT ENERGY
Line_1855	I WOULD CAN'T KNOW HOW IT'S APSOLUTEE
Line_1856	LEARNING HOW TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THAT NICK
Line_1857	TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIT UP
Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELLATATVE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT UP THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING A PATHWAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAS THE ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO IT COMES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BUB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND MIX INTO THE D CELL
Line_1862	NO IT TALKS
Line_1863	IT'S BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THAT THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1865	THE ENERGY
Line_1866	MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERGY
Line_1867	WHEN WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER D SA IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
Line_1868	AT A D CELL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT LIGHTER SO MAKE IT SO MORE HEN
Line_1869	ONE DES ONE LIGHT WLLTHIS HAS A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D FELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY OF THE L PASS WILL PASS THROUGH
Line_1872	THE D CELLS ARE TO STU TOGETHER
Line_1873	GOOD
Line_1874	MAGNETISMS
Line_1875	WHEN SOUTH AND MO GO TOGETHER IT WILL
Line_1876	IT'S REPELLING
Line_1877	IT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME
Line_1878	BECAUSE SAFRIAN THEY'RE THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEN POTENT
Line_1879	MAGNETISM
Line_1880	THEY
Line_1881	WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNECXS ATTRACTING AND
Line_1882	ITS ITS GOIN
Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND YOU CAN IT OFF THE LIGHT WON'TTURN
Line_1884	THEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT RONG
Line_1885	IT WILL WEIGHT UP
Line_1886	IT IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE IT BROKEN
Line_1887	IT IT'S FILLED IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT'S ELK IT WILL CIRCLE
Line_1889	IT BRAKES BECAUSE IT BEEN ON TO MON PROBABLY
Line_1890	ONE LIGHT RAN OFF RIGHT OUT AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT
Line_1891	IT'S ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WELL STOP THE
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY FOURCE
Line_1894	IT'S UM WHEN IT IS RA OUT
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT LIGHT CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL STHAT
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WOULD STOFPP ON IT
Line_1899	BECAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NOTHING HAPPENING
Line_1901	IT'S CAUSE ITS
Line_1902	CAUSE IT THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS RAN OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND RE
Line_1904	WHEN YOU DO NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT WHEN YOU DO SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WON'T
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON ONE SIDE AND THAT OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	IS WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRI
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MA
Line_1909	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS IRON AND SIDE IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S IRON INSIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON ON
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FOUND HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
Line_1913	ITOR HAS IRON AND THE MAGNET DUST IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT LOK
Line_1915	MAGNET STICK TO IRON
Line_1916	IT'S BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOES HAVE A
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN'T
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1919	THE NEIL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NO METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACTS IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DIN'
Line_1927	THAT IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE CREATING CIRCUIT
Line_1929	THE D CELL IS IT A CERTAIN ACRITY THE RICH CELL
Line_1930	BECAUSE WE ARE ALL THE WIRE IT'S LOW D L ABOUT AN ELECTRICITY AND S LIKE ICE IN MAKE THE RID SHAKER
Line_1931	THAT ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	A CELL HAS TO BE HARD TO CHU WIRES TO GO WITH FRY TO GO LAY ELECTRICITY TO GO INTO
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GOING TO GO EL BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT PRE OTHER CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLATTERY
Line_1935	UM METAL I CHERCUAL TO THE IRON SO AND IT ELECTRICITY TO GET ALL ROUGH
Line_1936	IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAGS AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WILL GO THREE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH HAS TO U
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING THE SO THEN IT IT WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES THEN IT WILL WORN AND THE FLAG BURN
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT LITER
Line_1942	IT WOULD E WORKED CACPY SUNNY AND WHY HOW THINK IT ER
Line_1943	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES IND INTO THE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION AND THEN IT BAKES THE FLAG OR
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1945	PRODUCERS ELECTRICITY MAKE QUE
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE WIDE AND IT DISN A HEAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEEN AND BARN
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL IN THE WAIT TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1949	IT'S HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTHER AND MAKE IN FLAT TO
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITC
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WOLN'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	THE SWITCH PASS ME OFF
Line_1953	IT DOUSN'T WORK
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR STUCKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE SELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1956	THEY WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1958	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	IT MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING A CTICUITS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1963	LETRICTRICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE MITAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO A TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	HAS TO MAKE A PASS WHEN YOU CONNECTED IT
Line_1969	IT LIKE THE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT IT GOES BACK
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT HAS HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULLB BACK INTO THE POSIT
Line_1974	NOW IT'S GOING THE WAY BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED AROUND IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPOSITWAY
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH A LITTLE LIGHT BULB
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA THE TWO BACES OF THE BULB IT DONT WOULDN'T WOR CAUSE THE WIRES SO GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOULD WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FINE WE'VE MET BEFORE
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOUVE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH A ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT PA
Line_1981	USE TO PUT A NEALL IN THERE IT'S IT'S LIKE WEIGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
Line_1983	YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE MET BEFORE BUT THE I DON'T WANNA MEAT YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
Line_1985	ACHING THIS ONE UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO YEAH NO
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IT IT WORK
Line_1988	METAL ITS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS HAVE THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO BLUB
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL AN THE LITTLE MI THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIPE RIDER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART FOME
Line_1997	UM SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIXED
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS AND YOUR FOOD
Line_1999	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FED MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BULB BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYIND ON TOP ON THE FILT
Line_2001	WATER IS FILTERIN
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAED IN THE COFFY FILTER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILTDURAIN
Line_2004	SOME THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALT WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU MICK SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIFE JUST DIED AGAIN
Line_2010	SOIL PRE EX
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE AREA
Line_2013	THEY SAID THAT THAT THERE WERE THERE IS THE THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL
Line_2014	THERE IS HOMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SALT IN IT
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	MISS GRAPPLE CLAY AND CELT
Line_2017	HUMMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SELT
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAIN AND FARMLANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARVIN
Line_2019	DILTA HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2020	THERE IS THE WAT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL AND THAT THIN BECAUSE IT HAS FIL CLAY HUM GRAVEL AND THAT'S DUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUMA SGRAPFUL CLAINS SILT AND THIS SOIL
Line_2023	ALL THE OTHER IS WITH PUMPED UP IT
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A WOOD OF PLANT LIFE LIKE CADI AND CACTI AND BUSHES AND MORE CACKDI
Line_2025	IT HAS A LOT MORE SAND THEN THIS
Line_2026	GOOD END BY
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLU
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT IS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S PLAIN ONE OF THE MIX
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT SOLVE DEVUL DISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEEN IT'S BULB TO PLAT AND THAT IT'S BEAN BIGEAHE
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTON
Line_2035	YEN S
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	T'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTE
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FORGOT THE WAR
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLID
Line_2044	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPEARE
Line_2045	TIME LOTS OF LOTS OF TIME
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLT OVEN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER LIKE A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THAT THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE A SOLUTION A MIXTUE
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER IT WILL
Line_2053	THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOWER MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTION
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFY FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FIL FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISOLVING BEBECAUSE SOME MIX
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO A SKY OR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPOR
Line_2065	CAN WE PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION
Line_2068	SPONS ARE FLOWTING
Line_2069	E
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIGHER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEETER OR BITTER
Line_2072	THEY ARE GOING TO BE HARD SWEETER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEETER AND THEY LOOK DENSER
Line_2074	THEY ARE DILUTED
Line_2075	LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATER OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD EITHER TAKE OUT FIFUM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY DICKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	BLOWLBLAW OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES A TASTER AND ONES OBSERVED
Line_2083	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON THE SCAIL
Line_2084	ONES TEN GRA TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION ONE AND SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENCITY HAS IS UM THE CORK IS LIGHTER THAN THE PENY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLOW
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS
Line_2096	BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD FLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THEN WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIX
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A M FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED GOT BACK
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRAM IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THAN THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BY THE BULBYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE SHOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ACID
Line_2109	BECAUSE UM IT
Line_2110	MOUNT PAR
Line_2111	SAME CAR AND OUR SCIENCE NOT BOOKS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE I SAID
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SI
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S BIKE
Line_2118	SAY IT AGAIN SAD W WHAT YEAH YEAH HOW MY DUDOM DU
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SAID THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NOW
Line_2122	EVEVEEN DOING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANT AND THEY REACT OFF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTES
Line_2126	YOH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	IT'S TWO E
Line_2128	THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM I NOTHING DRUM SOME
Line_2130	ING SODA I CALCIMUM CHLORINE ACH TO B
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT S A PRECIPITATES
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'RE ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING JUST ICE GETTING PUT IN IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWEATTING
Line_2135	THE WATER IS CHANGING COLOR
Line_2136	IT'S PITTY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS UM BUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIZZED AND I DON'T KNOW WHI
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE GRE
Line_2141	YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE HAS NOT AT AL
Line_2143	IF A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIX OR IF IT TURN HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	CALCIOM CLORED WATER AND SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY EITHER BLUE UP THE BAG AND THE FIZZED
Line_2147	THERE IS GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCES WEARED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CAMICAL REACTION ON SCAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE HAS MORE SOLID
Line_2152	I MOW HOW WELL I DON'T HEAR AND ABOUT THE JALLAR
Line_2153	FROM WATER THE YEALE
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SO
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A HOPING SEA
Line_2157	WELL FIRST VAL SHOOK IT UP SO IT IT'S GOING TO MIX TOGETHER AND THEN IT' GOING TO SETAL AND IT'S GOING TO TURN DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT'S MY FRIENDY SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SO YOU
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNEFYING ON THE BOTTOM AND A SCREEN
Line_2164	THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES ONE
Line_2165	NOW FUN
Line_2166	THEY ALL HAVE PROPERTIES OR SHOW IT AND THAT ALL
Line_2167	WE'RE A LONE AND METER AT THE BOTTOM UH YOU CAN NOT COMMANOR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTAINS OR THE FOMLAN OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	A BYE BYE BY THE A
Line_2171	WIND WATER YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILL THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STOWN AND THEN IT STARTED WETHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF BROKE TWO THEN HIT A CUP OF ROCKS AND THEN SPLASHED INTO THE WATE
Line_2174	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVERILTUN AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A ROATED UNTO
Line_2176	THE BULDERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE
Line_2177	TELLS TO GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS BEEN IN THEIR WAY MORE THAN THE BULDERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING PAMMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN STREEN
Line_2179	FLUE ANYBODY THERE IS ALL MADE IT ALL
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CABMICAL WEATHERING PHYSICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHANGE ROCKS
Line_2182	LET'S GO COME ON DO YOU L
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER ASSIDRAN THAT'S HITTING THE LIMESTON AND DICINIGRATING
Line_2184	WHAT IS WHAT IS THAH WHAT IS THAT WHEN IS
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ASID RAIN IS COMING DOWN A SHAFTING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE L
Line_2186	RAIN AND PRECIP
Line_2187	THE ROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT TOOK TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SANDSTONE THE RAIN FREES DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMAGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIME STONE AFTER ASIGRAIN AFTER A YEAR STILL HAD
Line_2190	IT DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HAS NO ANYBODY THERE
Line_2192	IT UBRIGED AND A ROTED
Line_2193	ASIDRAIN AND ALSO AROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CUT BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE ROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A BANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS KILLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ILANDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITION
Line_2199	THE SCREEN TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ING CLASS
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND EROSION
Line_2201	ERSION AND THAT IT'S IN DOT AND A CANIEN
Line_2202	THE WATER CAME OUT AND LEFT A TRAIL OF WATER I MEAN MODE
Line_2203	IT'S THE DILTA
Line_2204	THE UH CITALLINAUM
Line_2205	POSITION A POSITION
Line_2206	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
Line_2207	IT'S A VALLEY AND UM WHEN WE HAVE TO FLOW
Line_2208	DUNCLEWHAECAP
Line_2209	EROSION AND RTHMATIELA CIRCUIT CARRIED AWAY
Line_2210	DELTA DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT SAME THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREEM TABLE
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS UM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE IS NOT EVEN CLOSED TO THE BOT
Line_2213	THAT FLAT IS MIENDERING AND THEN STEEP IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEEP SLOPE IS GOING VERY FLAT FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND CORNERS
Line_2215	T FLUD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY DEPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GONE OUT
Line_2218	IT'S HIR IN THE FLOOD
Line_2219	HERE IT GOES FASTER
Line_2220	THE WATER RAISES ONE WHEN THERE IS A FLOOD
Line_2221	UM IT'S QUE
Line_2222	PLAITS AND THE ERTH MOVING
Line_2223	VAULCANE IRUPSHON
Line_2224	LAND SLIDE
Line_2225	S WE WA SLOW
Line_2226	ERE SLOW
Line_2227	I THINK SLOW S
Line_2228	MINERALS
Line_2229	THAT THEY'RE NOT ROCKS
Line_2230	MINNAWRALES
Line_2231	WE USED THEM
Line_2232	MINERALS GO IN TO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MEAL
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCALE TO SEE HOW HARD WHAT ART WE DID THIS IN CLASS
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPPENS HERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIMEAN CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WHY DOES IT ALWAYS MAKE A MARK
Line_2237	IT DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	I KNOW THE ARE IT IS
Line_2240	THIS IS SO SAD I KNOW A YOU'RE LEAVE
Line_2241	DOI MARBLES
Line_2242	ROCK AND SCRATCH THE TILE YEAH
Line_2243	IT HAVE P
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH A SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS MIXTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	THAT
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GREAPE TA STICK
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SOLT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WA
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T LOUSE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST A
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHAN
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOUSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION AND THE A
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS A SO
Line_2258	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT BEEN COT AN THE COFFY FILLED
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIXK
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ASID DID NOT GET CUT IN THE S
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPR
Line_2263	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPER AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND AND THE CON
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES THE LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE THE
Line_2266	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I SHING THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWICE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE E
Line_2270	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTR
Line_2272	THAT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRAT
Line_2273	MEAN PIE
Line_2274	THE PENNY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE CORT
Line_2275	THE PENY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAT THAN SOLUTION
Line_2278	SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWED ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LIGHTER IF WE ADD THE LIGHTER SALT SOLUTION LAST THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON T
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	AUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2286	THAT'S SO
Line_2287	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	INS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE S TO LO
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SHOOGER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_2295	THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHTS
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT AND THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UM
Line_2299	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH ITS SOLUTION WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I GET YOU THAT
Line_2303	THEY SEATURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	IT WON'T DO SCIENCE TODAY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THERE IS BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORI
Line_2308	SOLVENT AND SOLUT
Line_2309	THEY'RE LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICE THAT THE MOLECULES ARE WE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFEREN
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM IT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE VALYOUTHINGS
Line_2314	THERE IS PERIECIPIT THERE IS A PRECIPITATE LEFT OVER
Line_2315	YOU MIXED SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WATER AND HIDROLICCORIC
Line_2316	THE SODIUM HIGHDROCK SIDE IS ALL ONE MOLECULE THE WATER HAS TWO TIPES OF MOLEC
Line_2317	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE ESCKEW
Line_2320	UM THERE ARE BOBS
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCT OF FIZZING AND THEN IT SETTLED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOWED ON AND IT'S GETTING RUSTY
Line_2323	THE BIG GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2324	THE REST ON THE BIKE AND THEN A
Line_2325	THE GLOW STICKS STARTED GLOWING
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FIZZ A LOT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T FILL
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FISITS AND HAS A PRECIPITATE
Line_2329	YOU MADE ICE THREE OH
Line_2330	THAT BOTH THAT DOES
Line_2331	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONSTANT RATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEY'RE MOLECULES LIKE DI
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LIGHERS IN THE BAG
Line_2335	A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND THE GASS
Line_2336	CULCIUM CHLORIDE IND BAKING SODA
Line_2337	A SOLID A LIQUID AND A GAS
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE
Line_2339	ON'T KNOW
Line_2340	THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BAG WEIGHS LESS
Line_2341	BECAUSE ONE OF THE BAGS IS OPEN WHICH LET OUT OF THE GASIS
Line_2342	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL AND
Line_2343	THERE IS HUMANS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2344	CHIUMES GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2345	THEY'RE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2346	THEY RIFFEROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2347	THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2348	HI
Line_2349	LE
Line_2350	THEY'RE DIFHONTYON GO
Line_2351	SOILES AND ROCKS AND LAND FORMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_2352	THERE IS WATER AND THE CRACKS AND THE WATER RE
Line_2353	WELL THE RING HER I THINK IT WAS
Line_2354	FREAESING AND ABARSIEON
Line_2355	ABRASION
Line_2356	THE AL BREAK THE PART
Line_2357	I I SAID WILL YOU MARRY ME ANG SHE SAID YES ITS CAN BREAKE RACK OF PART AND THINKING
Line_2358	THE TREE IS GROWING DOWN AND LOOKING FOR WATER AND THE ROCK IS IN IT'S WAY SO THE TREE ROFH BREAKESUP
Line_2359	HEART SPANDS WITH FEUTY
Line_2360	WHEN THE WATER FREESE EXPAND S
Line_2361	THEY WERE LIKE ROLLED DOWN A RIVER AND THEN THEY LIKE BROKE UP AND DISMOUNTER PIECES
Line_2362	AS THEY GO DOWN THE PIECES GETS MORE
Line_2363	THE TELEGRAM
Line_2364	FELLING EXTREMELY TERRIBLE TO DAY SO YOU DON'T KNOWLY NEED TO A
Line_2365	CHEMICAL WEATHERING AND STUFF LIKE THAT I GUESS
Line_2366	THE LIMESTON IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE OF THE ASID
Line_2367	THE SALT IS A MEAWNE TO THE VINEGAR BUT THE LIMESTONE CAN BE
Line_2368	WELL S
Line_2369	BECAUSE OF TEMICAL VLETRY
Line_2370	I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY
Line_2371	WELL NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENING TO THE STA CHE SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_2372	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2373	IS FORMING THE LIME STON INTO IT
Line_2374	A MOE YEAH
Line_2375	THE WATER IS WETHERING AWAY THE LIMESTONE TO MAKE THE CAVE AND SEE THE LINE
Line_2376	PISICAL WETHERING I MEANING THE MORNING IN IN
Line_2377	YOU SHOWED ME THIS LAST TIME AND I EXPLAIN IT ALREADY SOME GOING TO EXPLAIN IT AGAIN
Line_2378	THEY'RE ONED
Line_2379	OH I DIDN'T KNOW
Line_2380	AND IF THEY ARE MADED OF BENWNSUJUST THAT MEANS THAT YOU
Line_2381	PENNANAND YOUR IEBROWS LOOK LIKE BANANA NOW THE BANANA ROCK IS
Line_2382	THERE IS GREEN BANANA WETHERING
Line_2383	AND A WEATHERING HAVE BEEN THERE AND YOUR EYEBROWS THE LICK AS I SAID I BEEN
Line_2384	BINANA WETHERING
Line_2385	BANANA WETHERING HAS HAPPENED TO THE BANANA STATHU WITH BANANA IBROWS LOOK LIKE EROBANANA IBROWS AND YOUR BANATA
Line_2386	I'M GOOD I'M VERY GOOD TO DAY EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO DO TE CAP AND THAT'S NOT GOO
Line_2387	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT AROSION AND DEPOSITION
Line_2388	THE ONE ON THE SLOP GO OUT MORE FARGJER THAN THE ONE ON THE SLOPE THE
Line_2389	WATER IT GOES MORE FASTER IF THERE IS MORE SLOP THAN IF THERE IS NO SLOP
Line_2390	I NOTICE THAT THERE'S LIKE THE WHERE IT'S STEEP THE WATER IS GOING MORE FASTER
Line_2391	THE WATER WENT UP SLOWP RU
Line_2392	THE FLAT WATER IS FALLING SLOWLY AND ON THE STEEP SALT THE WATER IS FLOWING QUICK
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE LID THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T STUFF
Line_2395	THE EROSION AND DEPOSITION AND THE FLU WATER SORE FROM BULB YOU BIGGER BIGGER IS GOING MORE FARTHER
Line_2396	ONE WITH FLOOD CONDITIONS THE EROSION GO MORE FAR
Line_2397	FLUD WATER IS MOVING FASTER
Line_2398	THE FLOOD WATER IS FUSTAR H
Line_2399	THE FLOW OF WATER AND THE FLUODD CREEK IS MOVING ALONG FASTER
Line_2400	THE WATER WAS DARK FLOWING FAST
Line_2401	THERE'S THREE ROCKS IN AN ORDER BECAUSE PERSON IS WHAT

Line_2417	RUEENIM AND DO SUPPOSE THE SHALLOW
Line_2418	WHO'S LIKE STRAIN TABLES AND STUFF YOU KNOW
Line_2419	LOVES REANA LIKE THAT
Line_2420	I'VE ONE THEM BOTH LIKE
Line_2421	A VALLEY MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_2422	IN AH
Line_2423	LINE UP
Line_2424	IT'S BEEN A LUVILE OR HOW THAT MAN AND E
Line_2425	OLD AND DIS POSITION THAT WORKS AND L AND MADE THE AU
Line_2426	DO BLOSTS SHARE THAT

Line_2428	ALL BAT'S OFF AND IT DOES STUFF TO MAKE A VALLEY VALLIES ARE CREATED WELL THAT'S
Line_2429	VALLEYS ARE CREATED BY STUFF STUFF STUFF THAT ES ARE CREATED BY STUFF THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_2430	THERE WAS NITHER AROSIN OR IN DEPOSITION THAT CREATED THE STULETRHIT WAS YOUR ASH HOLE
Line_2431	DEPOSITION OR ARE
Line_2432	THAT POSITION
Line_2433	IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID A REALLY OR TODAY ABOUT LEM LIKE STUFF THAT LIKE FROCXN

Line_2445	THE BRIGHTNESS WELL THIS CONNECTS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE MADE FLASH LIGHTS
Line_2446	TO WHAT THIS DO THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO WE MADE LIGHT FLASH IN FLAT
Line_2447	UM E S ARE EL TRAIL ROCKS AND LANFULE
Line_2448	BRIGHTNESS
Line_2449	THEY LOOK A LOT MORE DIFFERENT OR
Line_2450	CIGHES ON ONE TWO
Line_2451	YOU KNOW LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS AND WHERE THE SHADOWS ARE IN THAT MINNERAL
Line_2452	LIKE BRIGHTNES
Line_2453	SOMEBODY CRACK TO BEAT A ROCK WITH THE PICK AX
Line_2454	OUT L MAKING ENTION THE METAL ST HAVING FROM PLAYING WITH YOUR

Line_2456	IT'S MARK
Line_2457	MICK TILE GOT ITS D ON IT
Line_2458	IT CAME FROM THE MINERAL
Line_2459	THERE THAT I NOTICE THAT THE GUIDES TO RIGHT HAND IT'S CREEPY DUST ME UH
Line_2460	YOU WOULD NEAED THE LUSTER THE BRAKE THE STREAK THE HARDNESS
Line_2461	IT DID NOT ROUL OUT ANY OPTION
Line_2462	THIS MENICALLEXIBITED A CLEAVE
Line_2463	THAT IS A STRIKE TESC
Line_2464	I THINK THAT IT IS JIPSUM
Line_2465	YEAH
Line_2466	THAT IT DID NOT SCRATCH
Line_2467	CAUSE BECAUSE THEY BOTH SCRATCHED
Line_2468	IT TELLS US THAT THIS MINNERAL CAN BE GRAFIDE OR JIPI
Line_2469	MALAKIDES MIKE BUL CALOGIDE FLORID GOLANA AND GOLD
Line_2470	BECAUSE THEY DON'T PUT THE DESCRIPTION
Line_2471	NO YEAH
Line_2472	IT FRACTURED
Line_2473	BECAUSE THEY CLEAVE INSTEAD OF FRACTURE
Line_2474	BECAUSE THE ROCK WE HAD FRACTURED BUT THOSE ONES DID
Line_2475	WE CAN CROSS OUT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR A CUORTS P SOIL
Line_2476	YEAH I GUES
Line_2477	WE HAVE CQUORTS
Line_2478	THEY HAVE NEARRATDE OUR OPTIONS DOWN THE CORTS
Line_2479	ABSOLUTELY NOT THING
Line_2480	EMSOL
Line_2481	DEFINATLY
Line_2482	S THAT WE NOW UH
Line_2483	CARE I'M JUST LIKE WATCHING THE COAL THING IT'S THE IGMIEEST ROCKS YOU KNOW IT'S TICK
Line_2484	OR METTARORFIC ROCKS I'M JUST PLAYING WITH THE ARMTRATCHATA

Line_2486	IT RELATES TO SOME MINERAL STUFF
Line_2487	MINERAL PROPERTIES TABLE
Line_2488	MINERAL IDENTIFICATION SHART
Line_2489	THIS IS USEFUL I DENTIFYING MINERALS LIKE T
Line_2490	TH YOUNG MEN THAT ROD
Line_2491	UM HARDNESS I JUST SAID THAT WERE YOU ASKING ME AGAIN BUT YEAH I JUST SAID HEART
Line_2492	BUT SOME OF THE THINGS DON'T WORK
Line_2493	HOW EASILY IT DON'T GET KILLED TO DEATH NO THAT'S THAT'S TESTING THE BRAKE
Line_2494	YEAH MAN
Line_2495	UM THE COLOR
Line_2496	WHAT NO
Line_2497	JUST NOW YOURE
Line_2498	I THINK THAT IT'S TO MY TO P
Line_2499	MU THINGS THE FINGER NAIL DIDN'T SCRAGE AT YAWN
Line_2500	NOT LETTING ME PRESS THE GREEN ARROW
Line_2501	NEANDS TO BE CREN'T YOU KNOW COAL ARE
Line_2502	A DO AND BUT HOW WELL SUPPOSE TO
Line_2503	OH THAT THEY THEY ARE TWO SOFFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REPLECS OFF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT REAYS ARE BALANCING OFF EVERYTHING AND HAND AWAY
Line_2509	REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BOUNCING OFF VALDMETERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT IN THE MIDDL
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WLIGHT LIGHTS
Line_2515	IT'S WEIGHT
Line_2516	EVERYWEARE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLACKS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BE BECOMES BLUE
Line_2520	THE REA HITTING THE VULT IS SWIGHT AND THE RASE COMING OFF THE BULB ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECT IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BULB AND THEN THE
Line_2524	I THINK IT GETS OBSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BULB
Line_2525	THE BULB IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLUE LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPEARE TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT LIGHT THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNGRE
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE ONES BEHIND IT BURN OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TWO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WORK
Line_2537	AS THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE BYE FEER
Line_2539	IT'S SLIP BYE IT
Line_2540	EACH ANIMALE HAS TO PLACE IN THE EAGOSISTM AND THEY ARE P
Line_2541	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THE FIELD FOR FOR THE T
Line_2542	PLAS UM IT E
Line_2543	BEING A PRODUCER MEANS YOU PRODUCE THE ENERGY HERE SA
Line_2544	A PLANT MAKES A SONA ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND DIRT
Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE PRODUCED
Line_2546	IT MEANS THAT YOU A OTHER THINGS TOGET
Line_2547	ANIMALES EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN SEAL THE ENERGY TOGETHER
Line_2549	WE GET THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD PUNCE AND ANIMALS THEY D CANT
Line_2550	YOU ALTHEY EAT PLANTS AND R
Line_2551	POLLANDS
Line_2552	PORES ONLY EAT
Line_2553	IMALS BEARS LINES LOCKER THE HI ES YEAH ANIMALS
Line_2554	PRIMERICAN
Line_2555	AND ON HEVORE
Line_2556	ERBEVOARE
Line_2557	THEY ARE DGAMPOS
Line_2558	A DHID
Line_2559	THEY TURN THE LEAVES IN S
Line_2560	THEY TURNS INTO DARK
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES SAND AND WATER AND MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAING THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SALT
Line_2567	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID AND THE MIXTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES THE DISSOLVE IN
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PANTS REASONS AND EMINIM
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWS THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIX DRAW
Line_2578	BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILL OUT A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WE NO IT'S A SOLUTION SORY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED WITH THE WATER GREAP CA STICK IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCAL TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO C
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	HIT WOULD TAKE SHIGARREER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIRER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO I DEE WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO Y
Line_2593	THE TASTE IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS I
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WILL BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COLD BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE COLD
Line_2597	I AM HAVING A BAD DAY MARNEY
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TIPE OF GAS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK SEE O TWO WAS SO CREATED
Line_2601	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TRRON IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE REACTION
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBBLY BE
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING AND WA WATER IS MISSING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THINGS MOLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE THE E
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APART
Line_2611	THE REACTED MULCLULS LOOK LIKE THE PROD MOLECULE
Line_2612	RIPEE PLEASE
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE MOLECULE AND A SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING AT MOLECULES FROM THE HIDROALICK ASID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT F YE
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAR AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FILLED UP AND THEN CALL DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SECRIT PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE I NO THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FEEL
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ON TO THE PAINT RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NO THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BYE MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FIND MAKING SANDWUAGES RIDING ON UNICINS AND PLAYING MAR
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2627	THE SALID IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
Line_2630	TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYED ON THE TOP
Line_2634	OR BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THIM SHARE IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WA
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DOES T
Line_2638	VALLED MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE WA
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	UH PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT UM IS IT A QUEVOLENT SEE
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY THE PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED ER BUL
Line_2648	THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	ONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY
Line_2650	THAT'S TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CECTRIC ASID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	GOOD BYE YOU'RE MY BEST S FRIEND
Line_2656	WHAT YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICAL SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALL THEM TOOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SURE MARNEY I'M BAD IT'S SIENCE
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK B
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MAGNET
Line_2661	I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	UM ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS A LOT MORE GRIP TASTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE DARK COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE REALLY GROWS AND JUST REALLY DISCUSING AND YEAH THAT'S REALLY YOU DA REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE PRITY BLAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLAND AND A LOT MORE TASTLESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU UM KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WILL YOU YOU CAN UNLESS YOU TAST IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THESE SOLIDS AND IT SHARE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND A SEE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZE
Line_2685	TO TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEE AND THE STONE STICKED ON TOP
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN THE HOLDS AND THE SEE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFY FILTER AND THE SAND STAIED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFY FIL
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS TO THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPARATE THAT SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOU ARE PUTTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
Line_2692	TO DAY MARNEY WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTE A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE UM SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLITES SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW HI UP
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SEE IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2698	I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2700	THE PENNY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORT
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAND THE PENNY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOW
Line_2703	UM OKAY AMONG CRECHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY ARE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTO
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE S EACH OTHR
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT I'M NOT SURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2723	IT BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGURED THE SOULT BY WEIGH
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ASID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHOGER MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGHS SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAN
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE C IS SALT I MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WIT CRYSTAL
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPSUM SALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
Line_2737	I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST ONE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
Line_2740	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2741	REACTANTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTANT
Line_2745	SOLVENT
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS LOTS OF WEARED STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASS
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GAS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERYFOLMY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKE BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED UP AND FIS A LAW
Line_2754	THERE IS SOME LITTLE WHIGHT STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY'RE MISSING SODIUM HIDRAWCK SIDE WITH HIGH DRAW
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECULES WE ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A LITTLE A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPL
Line_2757	ITS UM THERE A MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CANT BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACTHING
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PINK
Line_2760	THE FINAL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ON SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFEINEATELY A REACTION HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBLING AND FILING
Line_2763	THE WA THE BUBBLES AND THE CARBON IN WATER ARE CARBON BUB
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOKING INTO IT'S BONES
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST ROSE
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE BIKE
Line_2768	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOWS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ACCURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE EVENTRAL MASS IS
Line_2776	YEAH THIS TELLS US THAT
Line_2777	I'M REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNEY
Line_2780	MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MAKES THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE CENTS THE RASONS AND THE EMINEMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PENETS RAISONS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPPENDS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISCINIGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH D
Line_2786	THE SOLUTION
Line_2787	SOLUTE
Line_2788	A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S EARLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	MARNEY I ALL OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYE ALL SEE YOU IN YOUR WORST ERS
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GOING MIX INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLACES AS SOLVENT OH YEA OH YEAH YEAH I E I DID
Line_2797	ESORRIMARNEY HAVE TO GO CAUSE YOU LATER BYE
Line_2798	I'M DOING GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE'RE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TOOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE FAN IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOES
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBLES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO SET THROUGH THE FAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE HOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PEBLES ARE GETTING STUCK IN A FAN CAY MARNEY
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPERCLIPS
Line_2807	SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBLES THE SMALLER PEBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THEN WILL TAKE A WILE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK UN TO THIS
Line_2811	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ONTO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WAS BACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALLISED THAT THE PEBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREEN
Line_2814	YOU USE A STEEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBLES
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBLES GOT STUCK AND THE FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT'LL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VALPAR SHIN
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNEY
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU A
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT RESOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GREAP TAXTICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	THE ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAD MORE FLAVER
Line_2827	ONE WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	IT HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	SWEETER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD CHACE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRAPIER
Line_2832	MORE GREAP TASTICK
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN OKAY BI
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RED
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRICK ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SHOGER
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SCAIL
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE THE IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ICE CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PIXTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFYE SALID BEANS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE AND TO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATE GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLE
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WENT BACK TOGETHER AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALTS WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALLED THEM A SOLUTE
Line_2863	THE SRON STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLE THE WATER IS FLOWING AND THIS MIXTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW I'MS SORRY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE RULES PLACE AND THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WEIGH MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE M
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREATER
Line_2877	A MIX
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MAN
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MAN
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE ME MAM BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWIN AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO AN I UH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	HORIBLE TO DAY THINGS FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS A MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINEDY GRAMS AND THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAIY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PRODICTION MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SORRY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRAT
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST THE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DETERMIN IS BY TASTING THE
Line_2900	WE ARE SEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASIS
Line_2909	YOU IDENTIFIED THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUBSNTS
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLED
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CHEMICALS THING
Line_2917	IT'S A ADDITION PROBLUM
Line_2918	I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2919	THE BAG CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MORE
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNEW THAT QUESTION OP THE WA
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURE
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE THE ARE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS CREEN
Line_2927	THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S REAL TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE THOU TWO ALL MIXTURE
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING RASONS AND IMMINNIMS OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BRINGING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATELE
Line_2934	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATTEL GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SANDS STAYED ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SOLT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAM
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SASOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATEL
Line_2943	WE CALL THAT A SALUTE
Line_2944	BECAUSE THE GRAPE STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED IN THE OTHER AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THE SAME PROPERTY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIENT INTO THE WATTEL TO MAKE A MIXTURE OF SOLUTE
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S UM DISSOLVES IS A SOLUT
Line_2953	THE SOL THE SOLID SO
Line_2954	WELL YOU IS WHERE ONE ANGOOD ANT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVN
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURES
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY KEEP THEIR SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT LOUSES ANY MA
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX A AND THE SHOGAL STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF ITS PRODICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX THE
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT AN SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTIN
Line_2965	APPARATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WEIGH TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARNED THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SULVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEIR PROPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FIL ALS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MA THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ALL PARTICAL SIZE IT'S PILE THAN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICAL SID
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	POTICAL SIDE AND MAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PARNICAL SIDE AND MAGNETISM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS I HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS SWIT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNET IT IN T
Line_2981	I NOTICE THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP THE UM THAT FILL WHEN THE OTHER THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON T
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	DON'T GO FARNEYBU
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE THEY ARE
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PUPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PUBBLE STUF
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SULVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IT
Line_2991	THE LIGTALE COLO SOLUTIONS OR UH MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLEGRA POWDER WILL TASTE SMOWLEY CREA AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRA
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UM ONE WITH LESS GREAT POWDER WILL TAST MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TASTE IS NOT A THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2998	BY MERITY
Line_2999	THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING N
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU COULDN'T TELL IF IT'S MORE CONSHIONIGETED IF IT'S DARKER
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEF
Line_3003	MY PRODICTION WAS RAIHT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	WELL IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTING
Line_3006	BYE THERE WEIGHT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS SOLUTE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	NUMBER WINE IS THE MOST CONJENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST COMMENT
Line_3009	I
Line_3010	THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT SATUACION
Line_3011	THE COAL IS LESS DENCED THAN THE PENY AND THE PENY IS MORE DENCED THAN THE COAL
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	IN SOLUTION A THEY WOULD THINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	YOU CAN SAY THAT IS MORE CONTRASTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
Line_3016	THE MORE ONE WILL SINK TO THE
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WE'LL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE P
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYES AT THE
Line_3019	THE OIDENCITY CAME TH THE OUDECITY BECAME THE C
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE IGHTALE ONE
Line_3021	IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GRAN IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN GRAMS THEN IT
Line_3022	SEE YOU THERS DAY
Line_3023	UM YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTIO
Line_3024	IT'S FOLLGY AND THIS IT'S ALL BLENDED INTO
Line_3025	THEY ARE TO TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3027	THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	REACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGHT SIXTY SEVEN
Line_3031	THEY'RE A PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THELOCAGLOB
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOULE SCOOPS OF CICRICITRI ACT ASID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF E SUM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING MAIL LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DANCITYES STUFF
Line_3035	DENCITY YEAH AND CONSOLAND SATOARA
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACHE THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBITANT NUMBER WIN
Line_3040	I'M DOING AH SOME
Line_3041	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	REECRENTS
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CHEASID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLE THESE REACTIONS TAUGHT ALL
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM KEE THEY'RE SANE PRIDET
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW IF LE HELP ME
Line_3049	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLORD
Line_3051	ALL OF THE MO MOLECUES AND THE DIFFERENT UHM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UM
Line_3052	CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE ERTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE ERTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE COMPERVATION AN MAS
Line_3055	THE I SKIPS O FLOWING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FARTHER
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM RIGHT
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLE WILL
Line_3058	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	IT IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTING TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES THE MIL CAR REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE P
Line_3062	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM JUST FOLDED IN HALF
Line_3063	THE GLOWED STICK IS BEING GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
Line_3064	YES CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	COLNSULVATION
Line_3066	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GREAT TAST IS ADDED TO THE WATE
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK IT CAN MICKAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	MIND ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CAM IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE UH NOT I SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE A
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKING A PART
Line_3075	THE THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A MBI
Line_3076	IT CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YE
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FIL
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULT ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED SO B
Line_3080	YOU CALL IT A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARS AND GOES INTO THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NOW D
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	I BY UH CAN YOU ONES CENTANCE MADE CCIITY
Line_3085	YOU COULD HIT YOUR FACE WHILE YOU SO WELL GO
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS D
Line_3087	THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPEAR
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DIS APPLES AFTER BEING MIXED IT FI THE WATER
Line_3090	THIS SOLVENT
Line_3091	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE UM
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	IT CAN ENEMY OCLYIE
Line_3095	HOLDING A SWITCH THERE BARINIEIE
Line_3096	THIS SALT DISAPPEARED AND NOW IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER
Line_3097	A SOLAMANT SHE I THINK CAGE IN IT IT HE IS RIGHT OVER THERE RIGHT
Line_3098	IN A MIX GUESS IN A SOLUTION NOR
Line_3099	THE SACRID AID DISAPPEARED IN THROUGH THE WATER
Line_3100	LOOK LIKE CAIDES AND RAIN
Line_3101	WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_3102	THE SALTS GET UNMATION
Line_3103	SHE'S REALLY CREEPY
Line_3104	IT GOES INSIDE THE MALCLUES OF THE RAW
Line_3105	THE WATER REP BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING AN
Line_3106	REABE
Line_3107	A DIC OF SOLUTION AND SCIENCE IS COAL AND A PO
Line_3108	THERE ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MOULTPUT THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY ITS
Line_3109	BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE RUST TO THE MIXTURE
Line_3111	THAT GRAVEL IS TOO BIG TO FIT HIM THROUGH IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE THE GRAVE WON'T GO THROUGH IT BUT THE WATER WILT
Line_3113	THE SAFE DEEP THINGS ARE MAGNETIC THE OTHERS ARE NOT
Line_3114	MAGNETISM AND MAGNETS
Line_3115	A SCREEN
Line_3116	BECAUSE THERE'S MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE METAL OF THE SAFETY CLIPS
Line_3117	RAY I GET UH THE SAFETY CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC AND THEY'RE THE ONLY METAL AND THOSE O
Line_3118	ME SALL WAS MI
Line_3119	I WAS SO H
Line_3120	YEAH O
Line_3121	DRY MIXTURES AND HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3122	ADIOS THAT ON A MIGAS
Line_3123	GRIP STICK STUFF GETTING PORED AND MIXED WITH WATER
Line_3124	AT DON'T NO
Line_3125	ONE ID HERKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3126	THERE WAS TRANSPARENT
Line_3127	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR STEP
Line_3128	YEA ON MARCH WENTS PA WENT AND Y A
Line_3129	THERE WAS LESS POWER THAT GO OVER IN THE WATER AND THE WA AND THE AND ARE BALANCED
Line_3130	IT WILL BE SWEETER
Line_3131	THE TASTE OK I NOTICE SOMETHING WRONG THERE IS A THREE SPOONFULS FOR THE SIX SPOONES AND THERE'S A SIX ONFULS OR THE THREE SPOON
Line_3132	THE LEAST PUT LESS WATER AND ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THE HA HA
Line_3133	THE WATER
Line_3134	COIN SIGA
Line_3135	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ONE DISSOLVE A A SOLUTION AND ONE'S A GRA SOLUTION
Line_3136	THE DENSITY AND THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF EACH
Line_3137	ONE HAS ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLITE ONE HAS TWENTY
Line_3138	THE TWENTY GRAMS SOLID WEIGH MORE THAN THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE
Line_3139	YES SURE REPEET PLEASE BUT
Line_3140	THE ONES TO THE RIGHT ARE GETTING DENSER
Line_3141	TO DO WIRES NOT FONEY OKAY MONEREABLY
Line_3142	THE THIRD ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE SEC
Line_3143	I THINK THIS SECONT ONE IS THE LEAST CON
Line_3144	THE SECOND IS THE MOST DILUTIVE OR LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3145	I HATE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE S
Line_3146	UH SO YEAH LIKE D T
Line_3147	UH I DON'T KNOW WHELL WE WERE NERING
Line_3148	OTTOMAR ED
Line_3149	SCIENCE TALKS AND I HATE IT SO A LIKE THEM TALK ABOUT IT
Line_3150	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3151	A IT'S WATER WE SAW IN FINE OF IT LEM J
Line_3152	COMPLETE ITS SATURATION IT'S SATURATED SATURATED SATURATION SATORINEA
Line_3153	THEIR MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3154	IT'S SATURATING IT CAN'T HOLD ANY THE WATER IS SATURATED IT CAN HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT BECAUSE IT SALTTROL
Line_3155	THERE STILL SOME SOL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR
Line_3156	THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING BUT JUST MISS SHOOGER
Line_3157	IT'S GETTING LIKE IT CAN HOLD THE SHOOGER ANY LONGER
Line_3158	THE SO SOME ONE CAN A AND OVER IN THE WATER AND HAVE NOTHING HOW THE SAME VACT
Line_3159	YOU'RE MILES SO OF AN STICK TO AMOUNT R'S FIFTY EQUAL SHAVING AND U WE ALL LEARN THAT IN CANTERCOME
Line_3160	EATING PUSHEES AND PENS PIC OF IT I CHOSED IT
Line_3161	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW A VERY SMALL AND I AM ONLY GOING TO
Line_3162	BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MASS HOLE
Line_3163	WE HAD A WE HAD A ABILITY TO THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT LIKE LIKE RA LIKE WHICH ONE WAS WIT
Line_3164	WELL YOU OH GOD FIND WH THE TO MAKE LIKE A
Line_3165	YOU'RE PULRING THE VINEGAR AND THE SOLUTION BAKING SODA INTO WATER AND THEN IT'S PHISI
Line_3166	A CHEMICAL REACTIO
Line_3167	I FORGOT ARNE
Line_3168	THE VINEGAR IS REACTANT THE BAKING SODA IS REACTANT AND THE ME WAR LIKE THE CUP IS A PRODUCT
Line_3169	SHOT HAVE AN OR DATA OUR SHOE
Line_3170	A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_3171	REACTION
Line_3172	REACTION
Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK I BUT I THINK I I THINK THERE WAS
Line_3174	I SEE AND THE VINEGAR I SEE OXCIGIEN AND
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCRIGIN AND HIDRAGEN ATTOUMS AND A VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEANS THEY ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT TIPES
Line_3177	THE ADDUM IS AS TO BE DIFFERENT
Line_3178	IT'S FIZZING FOR A LONG LONG UM
Line_3179	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER
Line_3180	BAKING D AND CACTI CLAR
Line_3181	IT'S FIZZING A FING HIDING IN AT A RECLA HAND YA
Line_3182	PARTICIPATE IS THAT ONE IT'S CA
Line_3183	UH CAN YOU REPEETE THAT
Line_3184	WELL THE ITEMS ARE BLUE TWO OF THE ITEMS ARE BLUE
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE LIKE AS THAT'S SO
Line_3186	THERE WAS REACTION THAT LIKE THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY COOL AND LIKE LOVE
Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SUBSTANCES POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FAZED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NOW IT'S KEE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BAR
Line_3190	IT STARTED FIZZING SO AND ONE IS FISHING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR
Line_3192	IT GETS TURN GREEN WAS GREAY IT
Line_3193	ACCHEMICAL REACTION ACCURED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED GRAIN WITH THE DRIP OF CURRENT FLOW
Line_3194	IT IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT REM P
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER TRAIN PURPLE IT USE TO BE BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THE RAISE CAUSE IT'S TURNING THE WATER'S THING PA
Line_3197	IT DIDN'T THOU NO IT DIDN'T THERE WAS TOO MUCH IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST LIKE STAYED THERE
Line_3198	WE COOD A V
Line_3199	THE WA YOU CLOSED AND THEN WENT TO P
Line_3200	THERE'S REACTIONS THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE
Line_3201	D I THINK GUESS HOW SHE LIQUID AN ICE SOLID
Line_3202	I SEE BLUE I SEE GRAY AND I SEE SILVER THE GASSES OVER THE LIQUID AS YELLOW
Line_3203	THEY'RE WEIGHING TWO ON TWO DIFFERENT SCAILS OH
Line_3204	T THAT THE ONE WITH THE BACK CLOSED IT WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE BAG UP THAN BECAUSE IT HAS AIR INSIDE IT TRAPED INSIDE OF IT
Line_3205	THE AIR MOLECULES ARE TRAPPED INSIDE THE CLOSED BAG BUT LET OUT AND BALANCED INSIDE THE OPEN BAG
Line_3206	WE'VE BEEN MAKING HUM FLOWED RAGLARS
Line_3207	OUR HUMAN BODIES ST
Line_3208	THIS IS A PART OF THE SISTOM
Line_3209	WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_3210	EVERY THING SUPPORTS THE CAR
Line_3211	THIS HOLE BODY IS A SISTOM
Line_3212	IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT WHAT PART OF THE SIYSTOM IT IS
Line_3213	IT TELLS THINGS THAT THEY
Line_3214	THEY WREKDTOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE SHOMAN BODY
Line_3215	PRITY MUCH EVERY THING TO MAKE IT AS ST
Line_3216	THE CURRENT INCISTABECAUSE IT HAS CUNTRES AND N THAT'S WHAT MIX
Line_3217	THEY WORK TOGETHER
Line_3218	I THINK IT'S OTION WITH AN IROLIN
Line_3219	I REMEMERY THAT UM LIKE POLARTID OTHER PARTS SO
Line_3220	THE BIO FER IS THE LAND
Line_3221	IT'S MA OF THE OUT ON THE EAR
Line_3222	I SEE DESERTS THAT OF THE LANDS THAT MOST WE HAVE ANIMALS
Line_3223	THEY ALL HAVE SOME THEY ALL HAVE PLAND
Line_3224	LOOKS LIKE UM UM A FLECHAINE
Line_3225	I THINK IT'S ABOUT THEN T'S IT A THINK LIKE ANIMALS GETTING OTHER PLANTS
Line_3226	I KNOW AT THIS THAT UM BOTS OF BUGS HAVE LOTS OF ER
Line_3227	THEY'RE LIKE THING BUT THAT ANIMALS AN IS
Line_3228	I'M LEARNING A CATTAPILLARS AND COMPOSE THINGS COMPOSER
Line_3229	E MINENT MAGNICOMPOSORS D COMPOSERS AND CIRCUNNERIATIVE COR
Line_3230	COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SEEING THAT YOU CO GLASS OFF ACID
Line_3231	ARE EXACTLY EACH PER PEACE ARE
Line_3232	BUT DARNGETHER AND HOURS ATORE
Line_3233	MAR THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
Line_3234	UH THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCE
Line_3235	BEING A COMPOSORS YEA EAT THE PRODUCERS SO THAT THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR IN
Line_3236	H D COMPOSER IT'S THE COM MA
Line_3237	THINK YOU GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUME
Line_3238	THE CON WAS HAD TO BUNNY AND THE N UM THE BURIED AND THE LITHERD
Line_3239	A PRIMARY IT RAPIDS ONE OF THE PRIMARY COMES TO
Line_3240	BACTERIEA AM FONGI
Line_3241	IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING YOU
Line_3242	FINISH I STOPED TO FINISH IT CARNIVRS MOLARS D ONED WHAT
Line_3243	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DYJESTIO
Line_3244	THEY THEY ALL GET A
Line_3245	THESE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE COCUMEARS AND THESE SIZE A D COMPOSER
Line_3246	THE PRODUTIORS BE COMPOSORS AND CONSUMARS
Line_3247	THEY GET THE HM IN
Line_3248	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY EVEN BECOME IN THE PRODUCER IT'S THE PRODUCE STICK S TEN IT IT
Line_3249	I COULD SOMARTHE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER TO GET IT'S ENERGY
Line_3250	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONMTIANDATES THE PRODUCER
Line_3251	SOME ONE THAT EATS PLANTS
Line_3252	OH IT'S O ONE THAT EATS PLAS AND
Line_3253	SISTOMS
Line_3254	CONSUMARS PRODUCERS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_3255	IT IS ABOUT THE FOODWEB AND HOW IT WORK
Line_3256	THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM
Line_3257	ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THAT GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PROD SUM THROUGH
Line_3258	A D CENT COMPOSOR IS ALL ABOUT D COMPOSERS UM
Line_3259	THEY'RE IMPORTANT FOOD WILL BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO D COMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
Line_3260	WE TA FIRST SECONT AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMERS
Line_3261	AND OUR REVOR IS THE HERRWOR IT EATS PLAN
Line_3262	A CARONOF WAR IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AN NEAR AND UMNIVORODY BERRIES AND MEAT
Line_3263	THEY EAT MEAT IN SIDE OF THEIR AIR
Line_3264	UMNEVORS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_3265	THEY WOULD EAT DED PLANTS AND IT
Line_3266	THIS IS A D COMPOSER OR RED WIGLAR WORM IT D COMPOSES DED PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN IT INTO SOIL
Line_3267	A RED WORM IS A D COMPOSE
Line_3268	D COMPOSERS CREATE SOIL RICH AND SOIELE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR SPECIES THE RICH AND SOIL
Line_3269	THE WASTED MATERIALS TURN INTO RICH END SOIAL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEEKS
Line_3270	SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY THAT UNHELTHY RICHEN THINGS AND MAKE THEM HELTHY AGAIN
Line_3271	HO TWAL

Line_3281	A HUMAN BODY
Line_3282	THE SPACE I'M DOING FINE
Line_3283	I'M SORRY TO SAY IT AGAIN IT WASN'T THIS
Line_3284	HAM ARNEY HOW YOU DON'T SHAI
Line_3285	IT'S A SISTM THAT'S LIT TOGETHER
Line_3286	WELL YOU'RE A SISTOM BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A COMPUITOER THAT'S RIGHT
Line_3287	I WON'T HAVE A SCIENCE CLASS BUT IT IS A SISTOM I MEAN ELIMENTRARY NOT NOT MIDDLSCOL
Line_3288	MATM HAPPEN AND LEWISVILL LEWISFVIAL LWIS
Line_3289	IT IS STOP BBOXING MY MARNING CAN HEAR YOU
Line_3290	THAT IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SO SOMETHING
Line_3291	IT IS A SYSTOM AND IT IS H
Line_3292	IT IS SHOWING THE DIJESTIVE SISTOM THE RECRATARY SISTOM AND THE SKELITAL S
Line_3293	THE RESPITORY SISTOM
Line_3294	THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE HEART ST PART OF THE RESPROTORY SISTOME
Line_3295	THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE RONG HEART RESPRATORY
Line_3296	IT IS SPILT UP OF MANY GRAVTPOLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE ERTH LIKE
Line_3297	IT IS A SYSTOME GOD I DON'T HAVE TO RIGHT THI SAM BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT TO ERTH
Line_3298	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE S GRAVITATIONAL PULL MOVE
Line_3299	YEAH SAME THING REPEETE PLEASE CHILL IS NING MA LETS IT GO
Line_3300	GET DOES NOT IN A HUMAN HAVIER
Line_3301	THE'RE ABOUT A MILLIAN AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I DON'T THINK WE EVER LEARNED ABOUT
Line_3302	BIAL FEARS ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW AM ON THE IRE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
Line_3303	THE BILES FI IS MADE OF GRASS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER LIKE A NORMAL THING
Line_3304	THERE IS A DESERT A BORLAINA FORIST AND A WHY
Line_3305	Y ARE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH
Line_3306	THE REST OF THE PILES FAIR IS MADE OUT OF LIKE LIKE WET LAMS AND STUFF DON'
Line_3307	YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND ANYMORE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
Line_3308	FRAILOW AS I AM HOW TO COMPUTOR
Line_3309	OH US
Line_3310	THE STUDY THING MAGIGETE
Line_3311	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE EAST IS BRAKING IT'S DARMANSE
Line_3312	THAT THE SE IS MAKING IT'S DORMENCEY I JUST SAID THATYEAST ME
Line_3313	IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS I
Line_3314	THAT THEY ARE YEAH I ONE HEADS FOR MY EX BOCX
Line_3315	HOW DID YOU DON'T PUT IN THE TRASH AGAIN
Line_3316	THAT THE USE IS ALL LIKE FRINCIT THIN
Line_3317	ONE WEE PLANT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH UM STUFF
Line_3318	THAT IT GROWS THE PLANTS START OUT AS THE SEED AND THEN TURN TO THE PLANT
Line_3319	IT MAY BE DEWATER SUNLIGHT AND SEE TWO
Line_3320	SPACE FAR HIM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SERVIVE CAUSHUMANS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUID
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUD
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AIR BUT IT MATTERS ON IF IT STEEL TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON SIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OCSIGAN FOR US
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF THE SYSTOM
Line_3327	YES BECAUSE IT COULD DRILL THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBERGER I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBERGERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOODS SO NO
Line_3330	IT SHOWES PLANT WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE FLOM AND TSILOM
Line_3332	THOSE ARE SINGLE CELL ORGANISMS OR EACH
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	BUT THEY'RE IN MUSCIL CELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE YOU EXURSIZED
Line_3337	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS MUSILS
Line_3338	THAT THEY ARE PART OF HER BRAIN
Line_3339	I SEE SKINSOT
Line_3340	THAT THEY MAKE UP YOUR SKIN
Line_3341	SO AND RETORT MADE FOR THE SCELTOLE DIGESTIVE NERVOUS MUCULAR AND REPRITORY SISTOM
Line_3342	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE OUT OF
Line_3343	PLANS ALL GET NO TRANS
Line_3344	THEY ALL FORM THE RESRATORY SSTOM
Line_3345	IT LONG THE BROWN VARIES THAT I A FLAM IT FROM KILOS DICKTHED KNOWS A MOUNT
Line_3346	IT KEEPS HERE A BODY AND LIFE
Line_3347	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE THE HUMAN BODY BREATHE YEAH
Line_3348	NING IS ABOUT PARTICPSLAJEN
Line_3349	TO PROVIDE YOUR HU BODY WITH I AND IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR FING WITH OXION YOUR BODY WILT
Line_3350	ABOUT THE HUMAN MASCRETORY SISTOM
Line_3351	THAT IS THE AVIOLA WHICH IS
Line_3352	THIS IS YOU SO THAT A HUMAN DISPLAY OF THE HUMAN RESPRTORY
Line_3353	BELONGS IF OU THE BROMKI ROSHRAKY MOUTH NOVES THE AND
Line_3354	THE RESBRATORY SISTOM ALLOWS A HUMAN BODY TO BREE
Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECOND WALL IT'S ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3356	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR SELLS TO GET OCIGEN AND CARRY THE MATERIAL
Line_3358	TO THEY GONE
Line_3359	IF A SMALL I CAN'T CLICK ON IT SO
Line_3360	I CHOSE J
Line_3361	I THINK THE THE ONES PROVIDE AIR TO ALL OF U SELLS IN OUR BODY AND GET RAISE YEAH TWO
Line_3362	BIHOW M
Line_3363	BECAUSE IT'S A LEAF AND I TOLD YOU WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES RIGHT Y I HOOD
Line_3364	I ONLY
Line_3365	THERE LEAPS
Line_3366	A FIN
Line_3367	ABOUT THE HUMAN RESPRTORY SISTOM AND WHAT WE USE ST FOR FOR US TO BE
Line_3368	IT IS E AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOLM AND THE SILAM
Line_3369	IT IS CRONCIEAH
Line_3370	THE SMALL SICKS DANDS THE BRO IS AND THE S WELL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN ONE WHOSE HAPPENS IN YOU E
Line_3371	UH WE'VE BEEN UM
Line_3372	THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE ERTHS EGO SISTOM
Line_3373	UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE ERTHS ON IT CLAW
Line_3374	BECAUSE THE WEALS AND THE AXLE ARE UM BOTH PART OF THIS SISTOME TO MAKE THE CALL ROLE
Line_3375	A TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS IN THE CAR
Line_3377	I SEE UM THE AXLS AND THE WEAELS WHICH HELP THE CARMONE
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBCISTUMS IN THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE VANS THE LUNGS AND THE HEART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUB SISTUM
Line_3381	A MID HAS THE ERTH IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH SISTMS LITTLE SUB SISTM
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUB SISTOMS IN IT TO HELP THE ERTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREES HOUSES AND AN OTION
Line_3384	THEY'RE PART OF UH NATURE AND HUMANS
Line_3385	I THINK THE BILE SPELL IS MADE OF OF THE ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND TREES AND NO HOUSES AROUND
Line_3386	I SEE THAT ALL THE EGAL SISTOMS IN THE ERTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BURAL FOR FORCE THE WHIT LAND AND THE DESERT
Line_3387	THINK THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP REPRESENT WHOLE KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3388	THE LE SPEER IS MADE OF OF SAND AND LIVING CREATURES
Line_3389	IT'S ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND IN WHAT THEY KILL
Line_3390	THE FOOD WEB MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF EGO SISTOMS THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT THEM
Line_3391	
Line_3392	THE
Line_3393	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3394	WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
Line_3395	WE HAVE BEEN BEEN LEARNING THE
Line_3396	NO WE HAVEN'T BEEN DING LI
Line_3397	IT GETS NOTING FROM THE SUN
Line_3398	BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON D OCXSIDE THAT GOES IN THE ME AS A SUN
Line_3399	GETTING ALL THE FOODS ON THE THING THAT EATS THE PLANT TO GET THE SUNS ENERGY AND WHAT NOT
Line_3400	ELL S ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT GROW ON THE GROUND AND BACK PERIEA YOU GET IT
Line_3401	THE THE THE GRASS
Line_3402	I DON'T D
Line_3403	SUMAR THE CONSUMERS EAT UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_3404	THE DEER EATS THE WRAP AND THE RAPET EATS THE GRASS
Line_3405	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_3406	A CARNIVORE EATS MEAT
Line_3407	EACH I ARE RITY TOLD YOU ME
Line_3408	CASE CAROMOLEVILY E MY OH CLO
Line_3409	OMTHEBORD ONLY EAT BERIES AND ME
Line_3410	EAT AND BERRY
Line_3411	THEY EVERY THING IN THE WORLD EVEN CAR
Line_3412	D COMPOOR EATS ALL THE STUFF AROUND DAY
Line_3413	D COMPOSERS E RAW THING ON LIGHT
Line_3414	BARY AND MOST CONCILMILPUUM
Line_3415	AND UM THE VAL TO
Line_3416	A COM NO BUL
Line_3417	ERITHMORMS ARE COOMNEVORBS AND ITUTE
Line_3418	THAT THEY LIKE THAT EMVIRONMENT
Line_3419	THEY WILL DIG HOLES IN IT AND EAT THE FOOD INSIDE THE DARK
Line_3420	IT CREATES ON THE SOL THAT HAS THOSE THINGS IN THE WORLD
Line_3421	BOING WELL HARE COW ARE YOU
Line_3422	IT LOOKS LIKE A HOLBUNCH OF WARMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
Line_3423	ALL OF THE PLANTS ON THE GROUND LIKE THE REAT
Line_3424	A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS UM
Line_3425	ALH THE LIVING CELLS AND THEIR PLAN
Line_3426	WHEN I CLICK ON THE LEG I NOTICE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE BUGS IN SIDE OF
Line_3427	MUSTLE CELLS ARE THE MOST PART OF THE BODY SO THAT YOU CAN RUN WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
Line_3428	THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THE
Line_3429	I SEE YOU THE BRAINS NOMIROMS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE GET A PERSON SMARTER
Line_3430	THE BRAIN CELLS WHIT THE NEMERAUN'S COMING OUT OF THEM
Line_3431	THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF A CALLED NEURONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW WHEND NEW NEUMARON COMES OUT
Line_3432	I SEE SOME SORT OF DISSINE BUT I CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS
Line_3433	IMPORTANT THAT THESE KIND OF SKIN CELLS IS HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HELTHY HEART
Line_3434	THAT THEY HELP PULLED THE SKIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
Line_3435	THEY ARE MADE OF THE FLESH AND BAT DISCIN CELLS CONNECT TO
Line_3436	UH YES BECAUSE THE ANIMALS THE MAGNET MANBLS ALL HAVE THE SAME SKIN SEAL
Line_3437	I NOTICE A BUNCH OF LITTLE CELLS IN THE E AND AND THE SKIN CELLS
Line_3438	I THINK THIS CAN BE TRYING TO SHOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF SELVES THAT ALL DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS HAVE
Line_3439	I SEE SOME SORT OF WEARED LITTLE CELL AND THE UH PLANT CELL THAT'S IF MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN CELL
Line_3440	THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT DIFFERENT TIPES CELL AS EACH ANIMAL HA
Line_3441	WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT HUMANS AND SALTS IS UM ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
Line_3442	THAT THERE IS A BLUNING SCREEN AND FROUNNAMY
Line_3443	ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGESTIVE ISTUM ON THE HUMAN
Line_3444	DYJESTIVE SISTOMS HELP YOUR FOOD BRAKE DOWN AND GO INTO THE BLOOD
Line_3445	IT BREAKS DOWN SO
Line_3446	SALFIGUS LEADS THE FOODS TO INTER THE STOUMMICK
Line_3447	THE LIQUID ASID
Line_3448	THEY ARE THE BIGEST PART OF THE DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3449	THE LONG IN ESTANCE IS FOR THE WEST REMOVAL AND THE SMALL INTESTANCE IS FOR THE FOOD TO GO DOWN
Line_3450	THOUGH DO JUST SLOW SO GO UNDER A BLUB STREEM
Line_3451	ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL OF THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3452	WE WON'T ON THE EACESTA SO
Line_3453	OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL SELLS THEY'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_3454	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING CELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3455	OH THE HUMAN BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR SELLS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINE PALMEY AND ANOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
Line_3459	UH THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND ON THE LIKE THE PALMATE HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
Line_3460	THEIR PATTERONS ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIZE OF THE LEAF
Line_3461	HOW SOME ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS
Line_3462	PALMAY POLMAY AND PARALLEL
Line_3463	THAT IS A PALMATE
Line_3464	TO HOLD THE LEAF TOGETHER
Line_3465	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3466	THE RESPRATORY SISTOM
Line_3467	I KNOW NO
Line_3468	I THINK THE VASCILO SISTOM LAIGHS AS ALL OF THE THINGS
Line_3469	ONE TWO GOES UP THE OTHER TWO GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LEAVES
Line_3471	THAT DOES WHAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_3473	GOOD
Line_3474	IT'S ALL THE PLTES OR BING OUR SUN
Line_3475	BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING US THE CENTIME SOLAR FLAG
Line_3476	SO DRAW LIKE A
Line_3477	DR STEEL GUNS AND ALSO THE INNER PLANETS
Line_3478	THE INNER PLANETS ARE SUPERSMELL
Line_3479	THE ERTH ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVETY WE HAVE TO SHOOT IN T
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SISTOMS
Line_3481	ERTH LUGGAGE COMPUTORS CARS THE HUMAN BODY AND THE UNIVERSE
Line_3482	IT HELP IT SAYS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN A DON'T
Line_3483	TH A SISTOM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SISTOM
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THE INVOLVING THE SIYSTOM
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY I LIGHT
Line_3487	IT IS ON ERTH IT IS THE ERTH AND THAT IS A S
Line_3488	THE INTERACTING PARTS AND IN IT
Line_3489	THIS I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN OTCION HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES
Line_3492	UM THERE ARE EGOCISCTIOMS AND I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMAL
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFERICA IT BROUGHT UP DESERT
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND ICE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	S MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THEM
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY ARE TO BE A D COMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SISTUMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS ORE BAGATERIA
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE COM
Line_3502	IRE CONSUMARS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_3503	A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATH AND EAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHS IN SEE TO WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATH OUT AND THEY BREATH OUR AIR WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATH IN
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SOOD
Line_3506	CONSUMAR IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMAR IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASCKIN
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINECOP
Line_3509	IT IS A FOOD CHAINE OF MANY DIFFERENT THIN
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS SOME OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	THE AR BEFORE IT ONLY EATS PLANTS
Line_3512	THINK THAT AN OBNAMORE MEANS THAT YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND THE ANIMALS
Line_3513	I THINK A D COMPOSAR IS
Line_3514	DED PLANTS AND ANIMAL
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER UM THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE ERTH THAT HELP IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS A A COMPOSER
Line_3517	CARNIVORE
Line_3518	IT IS A HU B OF
Line_3519	IT'S A D COMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE ERTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THAT DEAD LEAVES AND THE NEWS PAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOSE
Line_3521	FORMS UM D COMPOSE IT AND MAKE IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SIX STUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF A BIG CITM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD O DOESN'T S
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BUG THE BIRD THE HACK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3531	A D COMPOSER EACH STED PLANTS AND AN
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DED PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3533	THERE WE GOTHE MUSHROOMS
Line_3534	YEAH CONSUMER
Line_3535	A JE COMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT
Line_3537	BEING IN ERBEVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NO PLAN
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NEITHER A HUTRBVOR OR A COMONVOR OR A ON THE
Line_3541	THAT CURIET IS A D COMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOOSE IS A ERBUMBLE
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOX IS A CARNE
Line_3544	THEY ARE WARNS THEY ARE D COMPOSERS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDONS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	A RED WARM IS A D COMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDONS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT STUMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT A I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY SO YOU TELL ME
Line_3550	EST IS A FONGUIS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN ITS DORMENT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLAN THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SOMELIGHT WATER AND SWAIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TOO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SOME AND THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NEW TRANS TO SERVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SERVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SOOED BY FOTO CINPHACIS
Line_3561	TOO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WELT
Line_3562	PLANTS NEEDE SUN TO SERVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WELT
Line_3563	THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO T
Line_3564	THE PLANTS GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIVE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEED EVERY THING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SERVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIVE AND WILT
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SSTUMS AND THE DIJESTIVE SISTUM
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SITTING THE BE IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND THE THE GASE ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING POLAN AND IT IS BRINGING THE POLAN BACK TO THE HONMICO
Line_3572	IT SHOWES THAT ONE B WANTS OTHER BEAMS TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTL SNAKE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DOORBELL RANG THE DOG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT IT'S MASS IT'S MASTER
Line_3575	IT SPUPPS THE MASKETO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE DOT THE DORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULAS IS THAT THE DOG BART
Line_3577	THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND E
Line_3579	THE NERVAS SISSTOM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHIN
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMALS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIGESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN A ADAPTATION
Line_3583	THE SCUMNCP IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DEFEND ITSELF FROM PREDETOR
Line_3585	IT'S ADDHAT ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHELW BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SEIRVIVE FROM PRE
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADEPTATIONS IS IT'S POWDERON ON IT'S BACK AND ON IT'S BODY SO THAT IT CAN BE CAMMFLASHED IN WITH IT'S HAP AT
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEBBED FEET
Line_3589	NEMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS OUT IT CAN FLIE
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE POTTER NE AWAY
Line_3592	THE SNAKE HAS AN ADAPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTL IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE WRATTL SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMULA
Line_3594	IT IS ENVOLVING A SCUNCH WHICH IS FOOD FOR THE WOULF
Line_3595	AN ADAPTATION THAT THE SKUNK HAS IS IT SMELL THAT MAKES THE SCUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SMELL A
Line_3596	UM UM WHAT DOES CLASIFY MEAN
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BIRDS ARE FLYING IN THE ONE AND THE FRONT IS THE LEITER
Line_3598	IT'S BEHAVIARE IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CATCHING THE DISC
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FRISBY WHEN THEY
Line_3600	NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
Line_3601	IT IS A NO UNOARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3602	THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVEIEARE
Line_3603	THIS IS THEY NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT IMEDIATLY WHEN THEY'RE BORN
Line_3604	THE CAT FILL OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE SPELLS ARE DIFFERENT THEN UM THIS THEN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MEANY MEANY UM CELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINK
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CILLS THAT ARE BLUE
Line_3609	THE ALL THE BIG BULLS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3610	MANY BLUE SCULLS THAT LOOK LIKE SKIN
Line_3611	SKIN CELLS HELP YOUR BODY RE HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN EST DOES
Line_3613	THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS IN ITS BODY AND THEN IT SWINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLYS DIJESTIVE SIYSTOM AND THE HUMAN DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE A DIJESTIVE SIYSTOM
Line_3616	IT IS SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTINS AND THE LUNG
Line_3617	THE DIJESTIVE SISTOM IS ALL ABOUT BRAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET IT BACK OUT OF OUR BODY
Line_3618	IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
Line_3619	THAT IS WHERE YOU WHERE THE FOOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTANT
Line_3620	THEY TRAVEL THE FOOD TO HELP IT GET OUT
Line_3621	IT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3622	THIS IS TELLING YOU UM PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THE
Line_3623	THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING IN TO YOUR BODY AND GOING INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN COMING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREE
Line_3624	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATH TO BE ABLE TO LIV
Line_3625	IT COMES IN TO THE BODY THROUGH THROUGH YOUR NOWS AND YOUR MOUT
Line_3626	THERE ARE TWOOBS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRINK YEAT AND GO DEEPEN INTO THE LUNG
Line_3627	BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS LONG
Line_3628	AIR GETS TAKE IT INTO THE BODY YOU BY WHEN YOU INHALE IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
Line_3629	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3630	GOOD HOW GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3631	IT IS THE CIRCULA TORY SIYSTOM
Line_3632	THE DOG CIRCULATORY SIYSTOM AND THE HUMAN SO CIRCULATORY SIYSTOM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAM
Line_3633	THAT IS OUR HEART AND SOME OF OUR BLOOD IS GOING INTO OUR HEART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
Line_3634	I SEE OH TWO EACH TWO WE COMING GOING OUT OF THE
Line_3635	THE BLUE PT IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART OF THE BLOUOD IS GOING THROUGH THE CAPLAIR
Line_3636	THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOUD IS GOING THROUGH CAVAL
Line_3637	I THINK THAT THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD UM THROUGH OUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATH
Line_3638	LOUD GOES THROUGH BLUD VESCILES AND GOES INTO THE HEART AND GOES OUT OF THE HART
Line_3639	I THINK THAT BLOUOD GOES INTO THE HEART SOME BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART AND SOME BLOUD COMES OUT OF THE
Line_3640	AY IS THE BLUD VESLS
Line_3641	SEE IS THE BLOOD AND IT IS THE BLOUOD STREEM WHERE THE BLOOD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
Line_3642	THE RESPITORY SISTOM IS HOW YOU BREETH
Line_3643	THAT IS ABOUT THE AIR GOING INTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
Line_3644	IT COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THE KNOWS
Line_3645	IT IS ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3646	LONGS AND YES IT IS IN THE RESPATORYSTO
Line_3647	THE DIEAFAM THE DIAFRAM
Line_3648	WELL ACTUALLY I'VE ARADY PASSED IT
Line_3649	THEY ALL HAVE INDIRECTING PARTS
Line_3650	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3651	IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT AND IT MOVES WITH ALL PARTS
Line_3652	IT'S YOUR BODY YOUR BODY IS A VERY BIG SYSTOM WITH SMALLER SISTM INSIDE OF IT
Line_3653	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAREMOUE
Line_3654	THE INDIRECTING PARTS
Line_3655	WE HAVE IN DIRECTING PARTS AND SMALLER SISTOMS INSTEAD OF OUR BODY
Line_3656	A SMALLER SISTOMSUB SISTOM
Line_3657	HAS ILANDS OTIONS AND LIVING THINGS AS BY A SFEREIC ATMISFERE AND OTHER SMALLER SUBSISTOMS
Line_3658	THEY IT HAS A BY A SVEAER A
Line_3659	LA WAIT UN SIZE I THINK
Line_3660	LIVING THINGS
Line_3661	IT HAS CREATURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
Line_3662	THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
Line_3663	GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
Line_3664	FODWIBS
Line_3665	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD CONSUMARS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN DCOMPOUTES D COMPOSE THE PAPE THE CONSUMARS
Line_3666	BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_3667	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3668	BY EATING EACH OTHER OR OR THE PRODUCERS
Line_3669	THE HAIR THE SNAKE THE HOUCK THE BIRD THE BEADLE AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3670	WHEN THE CONSUMAR DIVE THE D COMPOSER BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF NUTURANS
Line_3671	THE DED BODY S AND TREES AND STUFF OF DEAD ANIMALS AND TRUE PLANTS
Line_3672	THE BACKTERIA AND THE MUSHROOMS ARE FALLING D
Line_3673	A BEARIY OR A PEBLIC PLAN
Line_3674	AMONG THI ARE A MATREUMS
Line_3675	A MUSCROUM OR FUNGI
Line_3676	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3677	CONSUMAR OR HUMAN
Line_3678	CUMNEAVORS AND UMNEAVORIES IN HERBIVORE
Line_3679	CONEWARS EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAT
Line_3680	THEY EAT PLANTS IT ONLY PLANTS
Line_3681	PRIVEARS EACH ONLY PLANS
Line_3682	Y HEURBWARE
Line_3683	TO ONLY EAT PLANTS TO EAT BOTH PLANT AND MEAT WEIGH WE
Line_3684	A UM NEAVOR
Line_3685	AND UH MELLTHE WATER
Line_3686	TO E ONLY DED THINGS
Line_3687	LAY LIKE ONLY D D COMPOSED TO STUFF OR DED STUFF
Line_3688	A COM UM CARONEVORE
Line_3689	IT'S A D COMPOSER THEIR WORUMS THEY EAT ONLY DID STUFF
Line_3690	A D COMPOSER
Line_3691	THEY PRODUCE HELTHY STUFF OR PLINENTS OR IS AT ERTH WORKS M
Line_3692	MORE FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WOODS BUT WE ALSO STUDYED MARS COLINOORS AND HERBORS
Line_3693	A ME ANIMAL CRACKERS WHICH HAVES SHIOGER AND FLOWER AND WASHER
Line_3694	I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM AND GETTING IT'S NE TRANS
Line_3695	VERY VERY MUCH SO
Line_3696	WELL THE UM LINT ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
Line_3697	THE PUT ALSO NEEDS SUNMALLY
Line_3698	OH LENS DON'T NEED HENBIGERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD BUT THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD BY USING SHOOGER SUNLIGHT AND WATER PAPER
Line_3699	PALE FROM F DIVE IS NEED REALLY MUREMD CAUSE IT PRODUCES IT'S OWN DEN
Line_3700	IT LOOKS LIKE CELS
Line_3701	WE DID A USED EXPERIMENT
Line_3702	IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
Line_3703	LOOKS LIKE A FACTORRY
Line_3704	I DON NOT KNOW I FORGOT
Line_3705	UM THEY RE ECO THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS THE BUSSL AND THE T DOTS IN BETWEEN
Line_3706	THEY LOOK LIKE NERVES
Line_3707	NORMAL SELLS BLOOD SEALS
Line_3708	LIP OUT OF BY SKEAN
Line_3709	THEY'RE MADE OF CELS EVERYTHINGS MADE IT CELS HEVERY LIVING THINGS MADE IT
Line_3710	YEA HAVE A LOT MORE CELLS THAN E
Line_3711	HUMAN BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT JUST ONE CELL ORGAN ORGANISM LIKE E
Line_3712	A BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT THE SEES
Line_3713	I FORGOT M MISTAKE ABOUT THE LIGHT NEAH I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_3714	THE DIJESTIVE SISTM
Line_3715	WE BOTH HAVE DIGESTIVE CISTOMS
Line_3716	OURE DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3717	BRAKING DOWN FOOD AND GIVING OUR BODIES ENERGY
Line_3718	THE MOUTH BRAKES DOWN THE FIELD
Line_3719	THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMMICK IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STMICX
Line_3720	BRINGS FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMICK USING MUSLS
Line_3721	IT BRAKES DOWN FOOD
Line_3722	TO BREAKE DOWN FOOD AND YEAH
Line_3723	THE INTESTINE EXZEARB ALL THE NEW TRANS AND WATER FOR IT TO UH USE FOR A BODY
Line_3724	IT GOES OUT WAIYES SWITCH IS DISCUSS STEING
Line_3725	EYE ARE LEARNING ABOUT LEVES AND PLANTS
Line_3726	IT'S PALM MITE
Line_3727	IT'S A PO OR M OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT T THE PEE I THINK
Line_3728	GETTING FOOD FROM PLACE PLACE MAKING FOED
Line_3729	FEANS THE PLANT AND STUFF
Line_3730	WELL THAT TO BAG AROUND IT LEAFE THAT SHOES WATER VAPER COMING OFF FROM THE LEAFES WHICH IS VERY USEFUL
Line_3731	UH I FORGOT
Line_3732	X A IN WHICH HELPS OUR BODY WELL THAT HELP MAKES OUR BODY LEV
Line_3733	THEY BOTH HAVE PARTS IN VAINS
Line_3734	THE CICULETORY SYSTOM
Line_3735	THEN THE HEART LET ONE SIDE OF THE HEART PUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BODY ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMPS TO THE BACK
Line_3736	OCXSIGIEN UM FOOD WILL NEUTRANTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WAY
Line_3737	BLUE OR SETTLES
Line_3738	UM THE SAME THING
Line_3739	UM FURNACH LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
Line_3740	BLOOD VESILS THE HEART AND BLOOD
Line_3741	BLUD'S GOING IN AND OUT
Line_3742	THERE WON'T PRONG THE THE VAINS DELIVERY SIYSTOM THE HEARTS DELIVERY SISTOM THEN THE VAINS ON THE RODS
Line_3743	IT LED TO THE PART TAKE IT AWAY
Line_3744	PRONUCE THE HIGH WAYS FOR BLOUD AND THEY'RE CALLED VAINS AND ARTERY
Line_3745	UM THE PUMP
Line_3746	SEE UM USE U HOLDS THE BLUOD
Line_3747	IT'S THE IT'S SOLONG THAT PRIVLGE MEANS THAT IT'S A RESPATORY SISTOM AND YEAH
Line_3748	IN THE PARTS OF THE RESCRATORY SISTOM
Line_3749	TERRESPITORE IS A CINTIMA'S RESPONSIBLE REATING OCGIN ENGER BODY AND CARBON ACCIDE OUT
Line_3750	THEY ARE GOING IN AND OUT IS THE LUNGS AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OCIGIN DEER CELLS AND GETTING CARBENDAY OCSIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES IN AND FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE
Line_3753	THERE WE TWO ACT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF TO THE TRACKIEAH DEEP AND GO DEEP INTO THE S AND THEY PRONENCIAL THE AIR SAC
Line_3754	CELLS ARE DROPPING CARBONDAY X AND PICKING UP OCIGON
Line_3755	UM ESE
Line_3756	EACH THE AIR SAX OR EBOLIDE
Line_3757	E THE UM
Line_3758	THE CIRCULARTORY I
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE WHOLE SISTOM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BYIOSFEER THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BIOSFEER MAKING IT ON ENTIRE SISTOM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SISTUMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SORRY I'M ON THE RONG UM HIS WEB SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE USED OR USED PARTICLES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT UMNATRALLY SORE
Line_3768	MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SERVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOOD AND WATER TO SERVIVE
Line_3770	SONELIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FIRNALISER
Line_3771	DEFINEATLY DETH AND LAY DEFINETLY THAT THOUGHT OUT ARRILLA WE
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANS ALSO NEED AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE FOTO CINPHECIST TO GET THE IT FROM I MEAN TO START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS AS OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SO
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MEANY SELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG SELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE EAST IS MADE UP OF ONE SO THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIANS OF SALT
Line_3779	IT'S BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN ENTIRE SISTOM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DI JUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	UH CELS AND ORGANISMS AND SISTUMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH UM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS AND ONE SISTOM
Line_3784	PINK MUSLES IN IT IN THE LEG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINEY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSCLE SELL
Line_3786	THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS AND THE BRAIN ORGANIZED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AND THE EST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE SELL
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMULAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EET SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLYES NEED TO EET SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF SELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SISTOMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISMS AND SISTUMS IND SIDE OF OUR BODIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOOD THROUGH IT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONT IT IN THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMICK SO THAT YOU CAN DIJEST THE FOOD
Line_3793	TO DIJEST THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FOOD AS ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M VERY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SCARED ME HALF TO DANCE HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW OR WET WET NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DIDN'T BREATHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIVE
Line_3797	I THINK J THE DIEGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE A OLLAVIEOLY AND YEAH THE OLVIOLEY EACH
Line_3799	GOOD O MISS LIKE HOW ARE YOU
Line_3800	I THINK USING THE INSIDE OF A HUMANS BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS SEOW TWO AND O TWO
Line_3802	A AND BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3803	ITS
Line_3804	I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE TACK TO EARLIER
Line_3806	UM CISTOMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I THINK THAT IS A HEART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VAINS CONNECTING TO THE HEART
Line_3809	EACH TWO O AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLUD CELLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH ARE THE VAINES AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
Line_3811	THAT'S THE BLUE PART IS CEL OUR SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAVOLARY
Line_3812	IT S LETTING AND BLOUD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLOUD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLUD AROUND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BODY
Line_3814	BLOUD VESILS THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOUD ABROUNT
Line_3815	THE PUM SPLOD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	L IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SIYSTOM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASSES SO THAT WE CAN SERVIVE
Line_3819	UM THE LUNGS DEFENATLY THE LUNGS
Line_3820	A THE LONG LOSE
Line_3821	THROUGH AN BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TRECHIEA
Line_3823	THE WRATTEL SNAKES RATTAL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORIED WHEN HE SAW THE SPILL OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT USED THE QUITE FAT MAN
Line_3826	UM I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SISTOMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTICES SHELW IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WED FEAT
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN RIP OPEN HIS PREY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FIG AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF GAS ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOST BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIOR
Line_3833	UM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WETHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW A FRIES BEFORE IT
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HEURTS SO THEY JUST GONNA GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THERE SPECIAL REFLEXES
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHETHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SIYSTOM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO WITH SIYSTOM ICE IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT IT HAS SIYSTOMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AN INNACTION OF MOVING POUCH TOGETHER MAKING A CAL
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POW IT MOVEMENT WELL TOGETHER
Line_3843	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS INTERACTING POWERS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SIYSTOM
Line_3844	THE HOT AND THE IS
Line_3845	THERE IS MOVING POW IT'S MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES THIS
Line_3846	YEA HAVE TO MOVE UND TO ELK TOGETHER
Line_3847	THIS I SEE THAT'S A MOUNT LOOKING THING YE AND IT HAS COURSE STUMPS
Line_3848	UM SO
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLANTS IN THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND AMINEALS
Line_3850	EGO SISTOM AND LIKE IS THE BRO
Line_3851	THE HEEP ARE LOOKING AMINALS AND THE AMINALRS ARE EACH
Line_3852	A THE EMIALS PASSES THROUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ALL PRODUCING A CISTIM OF THE OR
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STUMES
Line_3855	IS A SISTOM WITH INTERACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SISTOM
Line_3856	IF IS A BENTRAVINT OR ACTING PARTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTOM
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE AN ARM DEE BOUT MOVING THE OTHER
Line_3858	IS IT HAS BUNCH OF SUBCISTOMS TEN OR CA MAKE ONE
Line_3859	I THINK THAT THESE ARE CYPTITIUMS
Line_3860	TICICTIUMS BECAUSE IT'S A THING AND WE'RE ACTING ABOUT MOLING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT WALK DIC TO PUT HORSES
Line_3862	GOOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS UM
Line_3866	IT'S BODY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUB SISTOM
Line_3868	A HART ACID NE AND
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGER PART OF US OF SOME SUBSISTM
Line_3870	THEY'RE U
Line_3871	I O SFVIEER IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN EGO SISTM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S LAND AND OTION
Line_3874	THE AROWBS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE LIKE OR WHAT AND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOWTS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD ME THAT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I THINK THAT WARM PLACE IS WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE CIRFICE
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE CIRFICE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO STRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRFICE AREA AFFECTS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED ME QUITE YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PETALS EVAPORATE QUITE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIERT OR SOIL AND ROCKS OR GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER ON THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GAS STA
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUPRECE WATER DROP LITS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THEN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SAROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER CITTING AND THE BOTTOUM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER EL TO HELP US LIFT A PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	MARNING YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	THAT'S ALL CAME MURNE
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEAL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT TER OR LATER THIS ER
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY IT WEARE AND IT WAS PRETY CALL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HEIR MASSES HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HAFIERTH AND PLASTICK AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT M MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST ALLOW EASIER TO YOUTH
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SAW AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_3907	THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH IN THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCAIL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS ARE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CARECT
Line_3911	WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISK IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED AT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORED A GUESS
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WON'T BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST ONE US TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE I WAS RIGHT ONE AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND AND IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROLE HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE ELECTRIC CISTOM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
Line_3922	UH YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHINGS BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND CUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR YOU WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTHWISE IT COULDN'T GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT UHM I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE SKEAL YEAH THE SKILL YEAH
Line_3927	NO DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE COUNT HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM UM THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WAIST THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	I NOBLE METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	IT NO NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	YES THIS BUN OH SORY
Line_3933	THAT WOULD BE FIVE I
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLA STICK WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	UH SORY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_3939	UWE GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I I I WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT I I I SHOULD GET IT OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHY WHEY DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY PLAN AND YOU WOULN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIP
Line_3943	A KAY
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DETHS WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
Line_3946	UM RUBSICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRITY USEFUL BUT THEY CAN BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING CA
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NOW
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T CLEAN YET NO
Line_3952	UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDENT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HAD ONE
Line_3953	UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO REALLY
Line_3955	UH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER IS USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH
Line_3958	AH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAT TAKE THEESE OFF OKAY
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR HIM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH JUST THIRTY ATE PIECES HENE I WALKED EX YEAH
Line_3962	YEAH IT WATER BO ENOUGH I HAVE NO CLITTALE I DEAH NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO I DON'T REALLY KNOW M
Line_3965	TWENTY EIGHT WEITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE KNOW REALLY JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO TEN AT THE SO YEAH
Line_3967	THAN YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBEBCAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE F
Line_3969	I HAVE NO CLUE YEAH SAYING THAT'S CLOSE ISTER AND YEAH
Line_3970	BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS MOSGOS
Line_3971	IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
Line_3972	UM YEAH SWE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY CAUGHT LETTER YEAH
Line_3973	UM IS LEARN THAT
Line_3974	YEAH REPEETING THINGS IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONE AND I HEARD THAT ON SHOW WAS ALWAYS MICE OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE GOES ON YEAH
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WORD FOR GUESS
Line_3977	GRAM S ABOUT AS ONE PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	M BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO ILOGRAMS AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A A GRAM IS THE S OUT AS ONE C LOSE A PAPER TIP
Line_3980	THESE TO WAIGHCE AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	U YE HAH A THOUSANDS
Line_3982	A MILAGRAM AND THERE'S THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGH'S A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	M EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BE ONE LINE
Line_3984	THE SNAKE THAT SHIN THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM USE THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRATE IT WOULDN'T BE A IS SLANTED
Line_3986	NO CAT BUT I WANT TO SEE VENTERACKT TO CHIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHT MORE
Line_3988	WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM VE HACK LI CERY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED PEN EQUALS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE THAT OR THE BEANS EQUALS A GRAM
Line_3992	THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
Line_3994	A HUNDRED CRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM S SEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP ON ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TWO MORE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT'S THE INDERACTIVE CLIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSES
Line_4000	AND WE DID WEIGHT WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	HE LIKE THAT THING IS GOING H IN GOES UP
Line_4002	READING RITING AND MASS MAINLY
Line_4003	THEY HU HU UH SLICHES RED
Line_4004	OH YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DISC WITH THE STRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING THAT MINE A BIT
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE'S DISC WITH THREE BY TWO BUT MINE WAS TWEN NINE TENTH BY TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DISK SEAMED SHORTED AND ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSE TO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NINE TENTH IS A I MEAN TWO AN NINE TENTH WAS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE PWENT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	M HE OKAY
Line_4011	HERE NO WELL YEAH WE DID WE DON'T GO HOLD SO FISHY MAKE
Line_4012	UM A METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR NAMES THEY ARE
Line_4013	NO IT IT ISN'T COLORED AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I I HAVE NO IDEA YOU MIGHT COLOR IT SOMETIME
Line_4015	THOSE THINGS MARK CENTIMETERS SALTOCAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDREDTH OF A METER IT THIS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER I'M ALL THE WAY ALONG LIKE IT
Line_4017	NO WE'D JUST WE'VE JUST STARTED CUTTING IT OUT AND GLUED IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	ONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALS ONE TEN CENT TO BE
Line_4019	THAT'S WHAT THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTIMETER ONE TWO THREE FOR SIX AN NINE TEN IN THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHAT DOES SKALONE MILLIMETER
Line_4022	OKAY
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE R I DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THEN
Line_4024	OKAY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT'S
Line_4025	I KNOW BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FOR I SAY THIS
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LEADERS NO CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPARE VIALS YEAH HAH THAT'S LIKE WHAT OURS WERE
Line_4029	UM A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUAL TO ONE LITER AND NO
Line_4030	UM NOT I I KNOW LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT IT WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	B MEDIEAH LA THE SUCH THING AS A KILOLITER I THINK
Line_4032	A LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	NEOAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UM YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM MOVES A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GIVAM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLOWLE TRAVEALLIY EQUALS A MILLOWLE A MILLOMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD SINE THE CUPS THAT LOOK LIKE THEN AND YOU WOULD PUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	WELH WELL I WANNA DO GRAJURATEJYEAH OP
Line_4040	YEAH YOU CALL TO THOSE STICKS WHOOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT SHELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	PANT THIS IS ON BACK COURRAGE THAT'S WHY IT'S SOME FALLING OFF
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DON IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET THE TEAR HAS ONLY HOW IN US WE DID THE VIAL THING AND THEN THE TEL HAS ALSO SHOWED US BUT
Line_4046	I CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE AND THE UM JUST THING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF VILES AND SOME PEOPLE SAY INCE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LEATER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WITH OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	MMM WHAT THE SAY I SEEN PINK A TENT NERICING YOU BY THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT OF THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT THE IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTHS HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND LENKTHS
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE US HARRY GOOD NO NO THAT ONE WHAT DID WE DO THIS WORK
Line_4056	THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSAND OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OF IT
Line_4057	W ISN'T O TEN
Line_4058	LIKE REACHING UM PROBLY THE EATHERSTHE LESST ONE THE S
Line_4059	I WOULD ONLY THERE ARE PROABLEYS A HUNDREDS
Line_4060	M WHAT'S YOU IN IN THE BANK A YEAH UM BAL EITHER ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	MMM UH MODO LIKED WHY WHAT WERE YOU PRACHING WHAT WERE YOU SO COLD WHAT WERE YOU SAY IN US
Line_4062	UM TROP SPABOLE MILLALITERS
Line_4063	WELL BUT I WANT TO SEE THE FIRST TIME ONE I DON'T FORGET THE A
Line_4064	NO WE WEREN'T USING VILES WE USED VILES A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH MMM WELL NOH WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
Line_4066	M NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE B LINE A SEE LINE A D LINE
Line_4067	THE SERREND IS A THING THAT SORT STUCK OF WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THERE THAT YOU STUCKED UP
Line_4068	WELL BYE THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH IT'S NO
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS THE LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BRIK
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VILES WERE DIFFERENT YEAH MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADUATED CYLINDERS BUT THOSE ONE'S HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER
Line_4074	UM HOW MANY OH THAT'S A THOUSAND THAT BIG THING AND THE ONE LITER
Line_4075	OR IS THE SOICCAND THE INTERACTIVE SODA CANIL I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES NO
Line_4076	NO BUT WA A HUNDRED NOLY THAT LOOKS NET EQUILLS
Line_4077	TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADURATED SELANDERS EQUAL WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT CALLED IS WHAT I WONDERING OH TWEY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONE'S WIDE IF YOU FLATTEN THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED NILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL EM ELSTOWNS STANDS FOR MILL LITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER AND TWENTIVIT THAT'S HOW MANY MILL LITERS IT IS
Line_4082	YOU WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER IS LIGNED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LIGHEDOUGH TO IS THE AT YOUR
Line_4083	YE A
Line_4084	UM UM OH HE NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WON'T LOOK AT THAT INCH THAT SAIL MAN TO REACT DOSING IT IT WAS
Line_4086	STAMLIAND TRACT LAW
Line_4087	IT'S INTERACTIVE OR AND SODA HUH LIKE THE ON SODA
Line_4088	BUT I WANT A READY TAPE MY TONSLS
Line_4089	IT'S HUND AH FONNENES
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WE NOT WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
Line_4091	ME YEAH
Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND SAID TO A CARPENDER
Line_4093	U I WANT I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED OUT A GRCERY'S STOOR INSIDE YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4095	UM A POLES PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD USE MAN HE COULD'VE USED BIG
Line_4096	POUNDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	SO I SAY ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTED ONE POUND THE SOME THING
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED AT THE UM UNI ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UN
Line_4100	AND PLASTRIC CHIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	UH UH GOOD TO USE SHORE MEASURE I MEAN WAIT
Line_4102	IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE SHE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	ONE WOULD BE SMALL AND ONE WOULD BE HUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND ROUPAG WOULD BE SO
Line_4107	WITH THE RULER TAPE MEASURED
Line_4108	WELL MOST DRILL MOST DRIVLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAME LENGK SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A WILLAR WOULD BE ESIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURE BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULDN'T USE MEET METERS
Line_4112	I NOTICE A HUNDRED A HUNDRETH OF A CENTRMETERS
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ARE AND A METER
Line_4114	MY DAD MEASURES WIT UM BILDS BILDING SO HE USES HOW LOT IS THIS STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE TEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A A KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE ZERAL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TILL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU OLD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD THE WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE THE TA
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD UM MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	OKAY THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_4121	UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURES IT MEASURES ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METERE TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPUTORS DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOORS AR UM CAN BE
Line_4126	WIDER THEN TAPE THEN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UM ROULERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WABLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE IT THE CORECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERS SO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED CID METERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	I COULD
Line_4135	YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN UM MILLIMETERS AND THE CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T KNOW YOU
Line_4138	NO MIRALLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPUNGES SPUNGES THEY SOAK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEEN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS OR MEASURING TOOLS
Line_4141	AND THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURED OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOUR LOOKIN FOR UNTILL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED
Line_4143	SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPUNGE IN ITS LIKE THIS AND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM THEM ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRETTY BALANCE RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COAT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPONGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WEI SPUNGE YOU WEIHT UNTILL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MESCEY H
Line_4147	UM HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT UH DRY SPONGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS AND ONE BY ONE AGAIN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TO IF IT'S LIKE AN HEAVY ITDUM YOU CAN GO BY FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU'D TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TO HEAVI ONE YOU PUT IN ANOTHER FIVE YOU'D TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	UM THE DRY SPUNGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN YOU REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4153	UM THE
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHTS
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGH TWENTY FOR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	AND THE END THE DRY SPUNGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	UM IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UN EVENLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIG SPONGE COULD HU MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY HO
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG IN SOULKED IT'S GOING TO BE JIGANTIC
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVI OBJECT YOU DON'T WANNA GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO IDEA WEALL YE HAD A GO IDEA
Line_4166	THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN AN ORANCH
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAYBE TOO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH I MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILGRAN
Line_4169	MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSAL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	MILLGRIN I THINK THERE IS THESE THINGS CALLED MILLGRAMS I CANT REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILOGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WES METER IT'S LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LANS FROM
Line_4175	TEXIS FROM HERE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS AMASING YEAH AH
Line_4177	DRY SPONGE A A CALM
Line_4178	AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESING
Line_4179	NOT REALLY JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
Line_4180	A HUNDRED THOUSAND HA H WA
Line_4181	RUSTING CASTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WELL HEN
Line_4185	LEVELE MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BARE IS LINED UP WITH THIS DE
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMPTY WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	IF YOU DON'T PUT ANOTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE IMFINENTLY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IN IT
Line_4190	UM IT THE THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED INTO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER AND THISPUNGE
Line_4192	UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCKETS
Line_4193	I THOUGH IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	THE KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBE THAT TOP COMPUTOR A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WEIGHT THAT OUNCES SIXTEEN OUNCES A POWDER
Line_4198	THEN MY DAD FLOMY HOME HE HE USED TO HAVE A JOB IN CALIFORNIA

Line_4260	THEN WE POURED IT AND IT TO THE INTO THE SODA CAN
Line_4261	IN IN SODACAB
Line_4262	MILLITORS ARE THE TWE
Line_4263	WELL A LITER IS BIGGER THAN A MILLILITER WELL IT'S AU MILLILITER I
Line_4264	DIDN'T TALK WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT YOU MEA
Line_4265	A LITER IS A UM TO A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MIL MILLILITERS

Line_4414	M THAT YOU WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RIGHT THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WITH NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINK UP YEAH
Line_4417	UH MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CANS AND HOW MUCH WATER COULD TAKE
Line_4418	UM M LIKE
Line_4419	I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO IT COULDN'T DROP THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER

Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THAT IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT NOT ALL STRAWS OR THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	WERE THEY SOME OF THEM WERE CENTER BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE COU IT OUT THE WE COULDN'T WELL UM ONCE WE COUTT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WE

Line_4449	IT WAS NONE I MEAN THREE S MMM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINIY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4451	IT'S WORK NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STAND THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT T EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAMS

Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRIED TO GET WITH OUR THE GRAMS WE TRIED TO GET
Line_4464	IN STEAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL THOSE BULKS WE COULD JUST USES
Line_4465	THE THAT TEN THAT
Line_4466	AT TENND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE HOCKXS THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	UN KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TURNS DURING IT SO IT TOOK LONGER AND SO JUST ONE PERSON

Line_4481	UM WELL I AN
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULECRUM AND THE BALANCES
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLEWAPPY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE LIKE YEAH BIG ONE IT CALLS A GRAM
Line_4486	WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT THAT
Line_4487	YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH WELL FIRST I WHOLD UP MY HAND AND I WEIGH IT THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USED

Line_4502	YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK IT COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THAT IF YOU USED THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONES WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS ANDPLASTIC CHIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCAIL THING WE HAD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AN IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD YOU PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LOOK OUT EVEN TO
Line_4507	IT UM THERE'S MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THAT WOULD
Line_4508	HELPS UM
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TWO
Line_4510	MEAYEAH AND
Line_4511	TAKE OUT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A HUM ONE GRAMS AND THEN WILL GO TO BUT IT'S FLOWTIEN IT'S FLOWTING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND SHE'S M
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CRUES AND GO OSOUM
Line_4516	WELL GET BYE-BYE
Line_4517	UH YEAH
Line_4518	HIE S
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHT IT PUT ANOTHER PUT UM THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPUNGE STME DO NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	O O WHAT SOKED UP ALL IS WATER AS IT COULD THEN WE WAITED AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIXTEEN GRANS
Line_4526	TO CLEAN BECAUSE IT SHOWS WET AND WITH DIRTY WATER IT WOULD ABSORBED THE DIRTY WATER OR
Line_4527	NO LONEDA I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMTY CUPS CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVIY
Line_4530	IT HOLDS COAL IS YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAP TO TU WITH THAT YOU CAN TU THE PART
Line_4531	KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND EVERY KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LICK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDERD UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OF FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE A HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO KILOGRAM IS PROLY GUENEBE IT IS HEAVY AS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS ARE TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT WOULDN'T WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THIS SO HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER IS PICTURES THIS HEAVY IS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOECAM PLES ONE L OF WATER LITER
Line_4541	YEAH MISSUS MI STOLL A FUN PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPUNGE WE UM MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WEIGHT SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPUNGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	THAT'S FIVE AND THEN THAT'S ONE TEN
Line_4546	IT WILL INSTEAD OF OASE HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALED OUT SO BE FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS IT CAN OUT AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THEN SHOULD BE SIXTEEN MAKE IT AWAY SO THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S AROLOCK ERUH LOCKET IN SIDE OF HIM
Line_4551	AND YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
Line_4552	THROUGH AND THEY'RE IN THE SPONGE YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER THESE WATERS HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY RALOCK ALL THE ARALLOCK IT'S GOING ALL AWAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	E IF YOU ACTUALLY WEIGHT BUT I SE IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	HOKAY OH YOU DON'T GO BACK UP TO HERS
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT A WITH THE WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCAIL AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUTS YOUR VEGETABLES AND SEE
Line_4559	PUT THE SCAIL AND WEIGHS
Line_4560	YEAH THE LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE N YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A
Line_4561	SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOLING SAYING SEEING WA HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SYSTAM BECAUSE THE PROPELLAR IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	I SEEN IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GORDIEN THEY HAVE TO PUT AN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL UM THEY CAN BRAKE
Line_4565	THESE ELOPTRECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BASE CELL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCE THE FOX
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING ME AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MIXIC A FILTER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNSES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU KNOW ONE A BUN IT OFF THAT HEIGHT BECAUSE IT STICK AND RIGHT
Line_4571	WE THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR YOU GO MAYBE
Line_4572	SO IF HEAVIY A BULL BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT WHOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LITTLE THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
Line_4577	UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PIGNICK IN THEM
Line_4578	WE
Line_4579	YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF LIVE BULBS YOU CAN BILE THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I BILLS MINE OUT PAINT OUT PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENIES IN IT OR WATER
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BULB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDILAMS AND AND THE LITTLE BULB
Line_4583	WHY I THINK THEY GOT IT DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES BECAUSE THEY CUT IT THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND ST COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIR PLAN COULD FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLI
Line_4588	I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FING YOUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGLING A LOT AND THAT YOU PREPELLAR SPONGE
Line_4589	I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GOING TO GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
Line_4590	BUT IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PRAPELLAR IS THE STRING IS MICKING AT A BALANCING AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PEOPLE ARE KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLAR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4593	O CAS A HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKE SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METER IS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PREPELLOR SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ROUND THE WATTOUM IT'S LIKE IN TO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONES SETTING UP IT MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND D
Line_4597	EL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNEY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE EXAXISS THE PENTILAM LENGTH JUST THE PENDILAM LIKE THEN NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAM FER PRODICTING WHAT'S FOR TEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTARMETERS SWINING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST MU YOU COULD TEST YOUR PRODICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PENJULAM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THAN A PENDULAM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULAM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PENDULUMS AND BOATS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PENIYES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT STINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHECK A PENY AT THE BELT AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPRED THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY YOUR ABOUT WILL TIP IT OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE BUT S COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHER'S END THE FORT AND A COULD'VE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
Line_4609	HOW THE PENIYS WERE STACKED WOULD SAY A WOULD STACK REALLY SLOFFILLY AND D WOULD STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE IS DOWN MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YES
Line_4612	I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
Line_4613	U CLOARTK AND YEAH
Line_4614	ANT ON WE ALSO IT MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCE IS WAS
Line_4615	OH I THINK FLE
Line_4616	THE UM THE METER STICK HUCK IS NING UP AND AND LOW
Line_4617	THAT I DUM AND AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S FLIPPY
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE ONE IS POUNCING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS POUNSING OFF THE WALL AND ON TO THE GROUND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKEING AIR PLNES AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HE JI GRASS ABOUT PENCILLUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PENGJULM HAT IS FIF
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LA SIDE UM
Line_4625	AN NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT'S HOW MANY SWINGS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF TWAINGE AND THE PEN WHICH ONE THAT LENT IT IS
Line_4628	WELL WE WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKEING THE PLAIN BUT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	YES THEY ARE PLAIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WE'RE MAKING HANG SOME OUT
Line_4630	WE HAD UM THAT
Line_4631	A LOVE PALE THING FOUR THE WENDSING FOR THE FRONT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN IS WHEN THE THE LINE
Line_4633	E HAVEN'T TRIED TO PLAIN YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TRYED IT YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THANK YOU YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANY THING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I KNOW I I I CAN REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MIND BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS UM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRA WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELVES UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WHAT I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE LINE WOULD BE UM I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	IT'S GOING YEA YOUA
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARK THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM LENGTH MAY BE MARKS AND HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	UH THE NUMBERS ARE LIGHTED THERE AND UM THE NAME WEAR IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THAT THE BOTTOM NOT OR THE HIGHEST NOT
Line_4646	U IT'S GO END WHILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING VARUWEL THINGS
Line_4648	MISS UM STUDY LEARNING ABOUT CATAPULTS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT IT
Line_4650	IN IN A POP SICLE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THERE
Line_4651	THE UM THINK YOU I SEE THAT POPSICAL STICK THAT THINK YOU PUT ON I SAY COM THUMP THE M
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORTYOU UN THE RUBBERS THE RIBERSTOPPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM THAT LOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD I DON'T PULL PART
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES FLANK THE FLIP STICK
Line_4655	UM JUNE I THINK IT
Line_4656	E'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOTS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM SLOW AND THEY'RE THE R THEY'LL UM DOWN
Line_4658	TO FLOW ON WATER AND THE UM PEOPLE TO GET ON THEM AND SEE THAT OTION
Line_4659	SISERS UMWATER AND AT IT
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENIES IT COULD CAN
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UM PEOPLE
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD'VE TILL IT CHOUND IT
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION RARING ABOUT
Line_4664	A LOT OF PENIES UM THERE'S SOME PENIES AND THE THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWING ON WATER
Line_4665	THEY REMIND ME OF LIKE THE PEN BEING PACANGERS
Line_4666	I'M WERE REMINDING ABOUT HOW MANY PENS WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT EXTINCT
Line_4667	T WIG CLOSES UP IT STINGS FASTUR BECAUSE
Line_4668	BECAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM HIGH
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHT IS UM
Line_4670	HOW CAN UM CHACE E IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM THE BIG ONES CARRY MORE BECAUSE THE U IT'S TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CAN CARRY MORE S AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CARRY CASE THAT CAN SMALLER
Line_4672	BECAUSE IT'S SHORT IN AND OUT AND IT COULD JUMP
Line_4673	THINK IT'S PISHWY IT'S ISH LIKE THAT CAN LIKE THE KIND OF STRING YOU YOUSED TO CATCH FISH
Line_4674	DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T LIKE A IN THE STRING TO FIGHT IT
Line_4675	I DIDN'T REALLY SHOW YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON ON THE STRING YOU WOULD TA TO A CHAIR THEN PUT THE AR PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ONE IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT PIG
Line_4677	IT DIPS IN MORE AIR SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN THEY CAN FLY FASTER
Line_4678	THAT THE PREPELLOAR IT WOULDN'T FLIGHT BECAUSE YOU ANY UNIT TO SPIN AND THE RUBBER BAM WOULD HAVE NO WHERE TO UM TO
Line_4679	SO AND THE CUMPITOR NICED IT ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKES THE BRA BAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF THE REPEL AND TO BURN AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THERE ARE TWO AIR PLAINTS AND THERE UN A STRING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S CANDLE CLING DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER R THE THE THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO NEED WEIGH MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RIVER BENDS UM SWINGS LIKE TELLS AROUND UM THE PRPELLAR IS GOING SO YOU CAN'T GET MORE AIR
Line_4686	THERE ARE TWO EIGHT AIRPLANE UM THEIR CAN
Line_4687	MAKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS CAN LIKE HANGING IT ROUND LIKE NOT THAT TIGHT
Line_4688	THIS SGRAF IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SCIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAFFING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULD
Line_4690	WELL IF HE CAN FLOW DID AND THE ROUT'S RAN ALWAYS
Line_4691	IT WAS ABOUT SEYING HOW FAR IT THE LID IRTH WELL THE COURT WOULD GO
Line_4692	I THOUGHT LIKE A WRAP ANOTHER
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENDS R FACE LIKE SNOW S
Line_4694	THEY WERE MAINING ABOUT HOW YOU I HAD TO IT SO FASTER SLOWER MIXED
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENJULUMS IND HOW THEY SQWEINING AND
Line_4696	THE GRAFT IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT AREADY SWAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PRODICTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL ANOTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN I WILL
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE FLAT THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
Line_4701	RUBBER BAND IN IT JUST THE PREPELLAR BAL LEAVE AND SPIN WHENEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRAFWITH AN EX AND WY AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS ON THE WY AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EX AXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASANGERS ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU GATHERED IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	WHY AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	E'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENGULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRANDFATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TAPE THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES AT ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECOND GOES AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS THE SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSIT SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEIR CINAL LIKE CATAPULTS YOU PUSH DOWN
Line_4724	MA THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKE YOU ABLE TO SHOT
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	EARN WHAT I THINK IS THE HIRE THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOT
Line_4728	IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIR THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WEY SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRITTY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPPER PACE IS WHERE YOU'D PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK S YOU'D PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTHS OF THE STICKS ARE EACH CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIER OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPER PACE AND WITH SHOOTING FLIPPER PACES WITH SHOOTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON A PLASTICK ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HI IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS HI
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP UNE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN CRYING PENGJULUMS AND TODAY WE DID HELP DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BE BECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A LOTCH LOT SHORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	AND STUDYING PENDULUMS
Line_4749	THEY KEEP I AM KIND OF LIKE ON A GRAND FATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOULD THINK THE BOAT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOULD TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TINUBIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACCURAT AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFE BOS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	OU AREADY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIME
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE I WASN'T HERE ON THIRSDY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TWO HARD IT MIGHT THINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK ERLLIER THAN USUAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAINS
Line_4763	THE HIERE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4764	HE HIER OR THE MORE PASANGERS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAFED ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE WIRE LING WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS AND THE EX LINE WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASANGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PACANGERS IT COULD HOLE
Line_4769	EX IS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THE
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENTY FI IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PACANGERS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANY ONE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	HERE'S A PENY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND THE PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT CAN GET THE UH THE MORE TIMES TWO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPER CLIP THE PENY AND THE PENCIL
Line_4779	UH THE STING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THE ALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PENNY USE GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE FASTERITAL SWING SIDEWAYS
Line_4783	STUDYING UH THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWINGING SIDEWAYS
Line_4785	THERE'S A PENY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	ITCH HANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE SWUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT COULD SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFIN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	UH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UH IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID AT THE LAST STARTING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATPOULEDS
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPPER BACE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE CWICK GOES AFTER YOU LAUNCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE COR U LIKE SLI
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LAUNCHED THE CORK
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIRST STICK
Line_4802	THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CWICK WAS LANCHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN WACH THE CORK
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LAUNCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO FARTHER
Line_4805	I NOTICE THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT FIRTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WAIT OF THE CORK MAKES THEM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENJUUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PENY AND THE IT MAKES THE PENY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S DRAFT TO SEE HOW LONG THE PENDULNES
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM THE H BIGEST TO THE LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE A ESTIMATE IS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SUBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGE IS GETTING LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH IS I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND IT'LL STOOL IN THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULDN'T SEE YOUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID UH STUFF ABOUT BITS AND HOW MANY PENIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UH I DON'T FROM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UH PENIES ARE LIKE PACANGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOOT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL UH IF THERE IS MORE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
Line_4825	SOME ONES DROPING MORE PENIES IN TO THE BOAT
Line_4826	MAKE SHORE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BUT
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING ME A GRALF ABOUT H BOTHS
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE YOUR BUNCHES THINGS IT
Line_4831	I IT WOULD LIKE SINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PACANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4834	I FIGURED OUT THAT UH THE BIGGER THE LIFE BUBS THE MORE PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOAT IS
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PENIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOAT
Line_4837	A IS THE BIGGEST SO IT'LL HOLD MORE PASANGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PENIES IT CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PACANGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY OF THE BO WHICH IS MIL
Line_4840	UH WELL THEY SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST TO LETEST OR LEATEST LEAST TO GREATEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THAT AT THE NUMBERS RISING UP
Line_4843	THE EXACT SE IS THE WHERE THE CAPACITY MILLIMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PACANGERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EX AXCESS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE WYE AXCESS IS ON SO TO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WIE AXCESS SHOWS HOW MANY PASANGERS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE WY AXCESS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOOT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALL OR PENIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOOT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4850	I NOTICED THAT THE THE UMBER OF THE CAMPACON THE PACANGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GREW
Line_4851	IT EITHER GOT THE PASANGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT IT SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH TO THE DIFFERENCE IS AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOTORS THE RIVER BANDS AND WHY IS A DISTANCE
Line_4854	BANDS UH GO PRITY FAR
Line_4855	WELL IT'S PLACED LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE SO WILL BE IT LIST
Line_4856	WELL YOU PLACE THE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF ER AND THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE GOING THERE SO IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RIBER BANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASANGERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASANGERS THE DISTANCE WELL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FEW DAYS AGO WE LITTLE PAPER AROPLINS
Line_4860	UM WE MADE PHENY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PEN
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PENTOULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4863	SOMETHING SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PENY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF IT SHORTER IT WILL GO FAT SLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY VERIBLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CAME TO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFEREN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONDRER THE LATER TIME
Line_4869	THE SHORTER IT GETS FAT THE MORE SWINGS IT THE IT TAKES
Line_4870	ECTUALLY THE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SLINGS HAS
Line_4871	UM LET'S SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRANGE IS THE HAIR THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PRODICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND THE SHARE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRITY MUCH OF WHAT WE DID SO FIN WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MOROW
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CORK AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOUNCH AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR A WILL GO
Line_4876	THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPISE THE CORK IS WHERE ORGAN LAUNCH AND THEN THE ROVER STOPPER HELPS THE STICK UP AND THE
Line_4877	A I'M NOT SURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE SLIPPER BASE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RUBBER STOP
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A PIXTURE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4880	YEAH THE WEIGHT MY UM AFFECT HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4881	YEAH WILL POLVERY TRI AND ON THE S TO MOROW
Line_4882	OR WELL WE MAKE EITHER A GRASS OR OR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A CHART
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER CAN IT CAN FLIP IT BEFORE IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MIXTURE THERE IS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENIES
Line_4886	HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BUT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOME IT MIGHT HAVE BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UN WHAT'S SAY
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT YOU NO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SENCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM CAN EVERYWAYL SINK FASTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT S
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY NOT AS TALLER AND IT WILL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONCE ABOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVER FLOW THE BOUT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY UN
Line_4897	CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OP OR LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4899	NO IF THEY ARE WRONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK UM ONE ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO THINK IF YOU STUCK EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT WILL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD BRO
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACCORMMEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIT CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG OF STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONES POSE TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE WILL UNDEBEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	ES I SEE UM WHERE'S
Line_4905	THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT WITH PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIAM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MADE FOR PAPER BOLTS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATERS THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	WE MUST WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PENIES IT COULD HOULT
Line_4908	TO HOLD PENIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WIDER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH NO
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEYL HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL A BUT IS
Line_4913	U DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SETTLE IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE I'LL THINK BUT IF YOU PUT IN THE MIDDL THEY'LL STACK EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SCIDEL THINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER IT'S TO RUFF THE BOOT COULDN'T TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S COM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN IT WILL STAY UP
Line_4917	THE THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE THEM SMALLER A BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
Line_4919	THAT UN WE K
Line_4920	ACITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PACANGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRASS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOOT IS THE LESS PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLT
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING HER IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HELP MORE BUT IF YOU PUT THEM ALL TO THE SIDE TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLT
Line_4926	IT'S CAPACITIES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND
Line_4929	THAT THE CAPACITY GETS HIRE SO IT IS THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS
Line_4930	THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PACANGERS
Line_4931	HIERE IT GETS MORE PACANGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	UH I SO IT'S
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PACANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW WE COULD WHEN WE SPEND HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PREPELAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS A PREPELAR UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPRED PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT CAN STREAM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU WINED UP THE PERPELLAR
Line_4938	WELL MEAN MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING IN THE AND WE LEARN THAT IF YOU PUT A THING IT
Line_4939	EFFECTS HOW MU IT CAN FLI
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELAR AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOR SIX AIT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE FIGGER IT OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS IT HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GOS SLOWER AND IT WILL GO ES FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WIGNES IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL MORE THE LESS PASSANGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSANGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT EFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF THAT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKE IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FIGER IT OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE
Line_4949	ELL IT'S LIKE YOU TICK OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS AND WHEN YOU FETCH THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICE THAT WITH UM AGAIN WITH
Line_4952	MORE WITH MORE PASS AS YOU ADD MORE PASANGERS THE LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROABLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ARE AROUND THAT
Line_4954	THE NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RUBBER BANDS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PASCIJE AND AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID IN MY
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DESK AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN JUST LIKE GO OF THEM IT COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TRAP OH YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THEM
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I STINK SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_4968	THE FLIP STICK AND
Line_4969	IT SHOWS HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMITERS
Line_4970	I SEE WHEN Y UM CLICK IT'S GOING FORTHE
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE EL OF THINGS WHAT E EXPELMENT IT MADERS WHETHER IT IS
Line_4972	WARMTH ANG YEA TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE OFF THINGS ILL THE EXPILIMENT MIGHT BE WRONG AND YOU'LL NOT SHOW IF NOT
Line_4974	IT DEFFECTS THE WILL DISSULT BECAUSE YOUH YEAH
Line_4975	IT TOOK ALF SHOELINE
Line_4976	IT'S CONTINENT BY TENT UM IT'S MOVING UP BY CEMLIMIEETARS
Line_4977	IT'S GAYING HIER AND HIER
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE STRING
Line_4980	SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WE UM MEASURE IT UNDH
Line_4983	UM MEASURING TAPE
Line_4984	WE CEP THE PENY AND THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE LO THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE OTION AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSANGERS AND SOMETIMES EMERGENCY LUGGAGE
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DROEUW A CROSS
Line_4987	WE BILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUP CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANCE SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZE
Line_4990	SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PAOINIES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIDE THE PLACE MEN OR THE UM AWAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I FIGURED THAT UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT VALUE FARRIABULES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOTS WERE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WEIGHT
Line_5000	WE DID BI US DOING EVERYTHING WITH EVERYBODY BAKING THEIR BOATS PRETTY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE WY AXIS IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS THE BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT FART THEY CALL LINE
Line_5005	WHICH WORDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW WAR YOU BULBS CHANGE THINGS
Line_5008	THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	S THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS SMALLER TWO SO PRITY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BY MARNE HAVE A NICE STICK
Line_5011	HUH MY NAME IS CAR AND I AM NINE YEARS OLD WE USE HOLE A QUESTION
Line_5012	CARPAPHNIA MEASUREMENT DECLINE AND SOMIT
Line_5013	ALL ABOUT HEIGHT A I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A ROULER A METER STICK
Line_5016	HEY ARE TWOBS
Line_5017	AND TALL AND AND TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WELL UHM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I YOU ER ALL WE
Line_5022	THE DOORNB ON THE PIXTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SORY
Line_5025	I SWEE ONE METER TEN METER A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	OU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WITH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN ROULRS
Line_5028	A DARNB MEAN A NOB ON A DO WORK
Line_5029	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A RULER
Line_5030	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HE
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN UM ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BUBBLES YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IT IS TEN SATTANLYE AND ARS UM IN THIS PICTURE
Line_5034	ALLOWS HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS ALL IN ALL
Line_5035	THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A WOALER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE MORE US MOST MORE COMAN
Line_5037	THIS BOY IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHT TEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
Line_5039	OH WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS YARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A MADE OR TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THE UM
Line_5043	SOME ARE THE SAME WINK
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU COULD USE A RULER OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN METER STICKS AND ROULERS
Line_5047	I DID NOT NOW
Line_5048	YOU CAN WEIGH IN THEM WITH THE SKY
Line_5049	I DO NOT THE WHOLE
Line_5050	WELL THERE WEIGHTS THAT ARE A LIKE CABLE WHAT A BEASTLIGHT IS
Line_5051	IS HEAVIER THAN CHIP
Line_5052	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN CLASS DOING AND
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST WAS THE EDGE OF THE MAGNET THEN THE THEN WOODN'T AND THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE JU
Line_5054	I DON'T WANT HOLD THE ANSWER IS SO I LIKE QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING FALANSED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR THAT WOULD SEE THEN T MAKE IT MEASURED WITH THE SO IT'S A LITER METAL
Line_5056	THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THE CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURE SHO ME THAT NOT THE METAL WASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MORE A CURRENT
Line_5061	WOUND IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT L METAL
Line_5062	WELL MEASURED IT'S SOLY BUT WELL I FORGET NOT
Line_5063	WE SEED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5065	WELL A SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE IN AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIPS SMALL ONE PAPER CUPS BI
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HAPPIEST AND ONE'S NOT HAVING D
Line_5068	THE LITTLE CLUB IN FROM ME AND IT EQUALES ONE GRAM
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS MORE GRAMS ALL WILL WEIGH UNTILL INCINETY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	IN THIS PICTURE TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THAT METAL WASHER
Line_5072	ON SEVEND SIX FIVE MORE THREE TO ONE THEN THE METAL WASHER GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE AN
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAM TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	ELL WHAT GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	OKAY UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH UH I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5078	I DO UM E AND ME THEY OUGHT ME GOOD HARRY
Line_5079	I DON'T NA EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERENCES WHAT IT M
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THESE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKE SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TO MEASURE THAT CAN KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	H UH U IDOM'S NO NO
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TWO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUS GRAMS EQUAL ONE KILGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVEN USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE A KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WHAT I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SCIENCE
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASURE MAG MEASURE MEN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN MEASUREING
Line_5092	ALWAYS A METER ARE OH I'M MEAN MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE CORTS OF WATER AND MAYBE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S LINES AND THAT COULD PROBABLY TELL ME HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD
Line_5095	VILE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND BY A ONE COULD HOLD A MORE LIKE TWICE THAT MUCH A BILE TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VILE COULD PO GROUP
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET TO HUNT THE RESULTS THAT WAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER'S HOLDING A THOUSAND NIWALITORS OR ONE ONLY KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH IT CAN
Line_5100	I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOWS IS ONE MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM MILLIITERS HO SHOWN'T HOLD OR HOW IT COULD BE WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED MILLITES AND THE BIG FAT TO BE THING THOUSAND MILLOMITERS
Line_5104	TAKES TEN LITTLE TWO BES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILL ER
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BAKE A KICK YOU CAN USE MILLLITERS
Line_5106	UM WELL I FORGOT
Line_5107	MILLOMETER IS BIGGER AND A LITER IS SNAWLER
Line_5108	YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS FEUNAL INCHES MILLIMETERS OR LITERS
Line_5110	THEY COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	HE'S MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS IN THE RANGE
Line_5113	OH IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCENE E
Line_5114	UM WELL OLD HOME WE WOULD PUT THE WATER AND THE SERRN AND WE WOULD SPREAD IT INTO SOMETHING YOU SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS THREE CIRANCIST TO FILL
Line_5116	ELCILIOMINDE CANT CAR A
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS AND AN FILLPS CUP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE HOW MUCH IT WILL WHOOP BUT WELL WHEN L WE STOP FIFTY MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES REPROSENT HOW ANY WALL
Line_5120	IT IS A LAJURATED SOUNDERA
Line_5121	THEY IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN HOLD A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER AND OR THE LIQUIDS IN IT
Line_5123	WELL THERE'S MORE GRADUATED SILENDERS THAT A FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5124	WELL I DON'T KNOW HAVE TO FIND THAT UP
Line_5125	WOULD BE PRODICT YOU COULD MAKE A AN ESTIMATE UM MAKE ING LINE AND SEE IF IT WILL GO OVER UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING AS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN ASK
Line_5127	A TO LIKE TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL TO WA ANDLEND AND WON'T MARK SEE
Line_5129	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDYED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHEN I AM ABSERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY AND HOW ALL
Line_5132	THE CUP IN MOUTH HAS MORE AND THAN A MIDE
Line_5133	ALL UH ALL C CAPACITY'S SO NOT ALL I KNOW
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A C WATER AND A CANTAINER AND FILL AT CAPACITY
Line_5135	SAYS TWO HUNDRED MILLIN OR A VESIL
Line_5136	THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL HOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIRE FAT OR SKINNY ER AND IT COULD JUST DON'T HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	WELL EVERY ONE EVERY CINGAL ONE YOU PUT IN IT'S A HUNDRED AND EQUALS TO HUNDRAMNILLILITORS WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLD THE SAME METAL WATER
Line_5139	WE UM HU
Line_5140	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5141	THIS IS NOT A MILLLY BUT IT IT IS A GRADJUAANE AND SOONDER
Line_5142	SILANDER
Line_5143	AND USING UM STORY
Line_5144	CUP ON THE LEFT HAS MORE WATER AND THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS WATER
Line_5145	YOU CAN DICK A ROW ENGINE PUNEL I WANT A THOU WHAT'S MORE
Line_5146	IT GETS RANGE R R YOU CAN S CERMAN PUT IT ON FIFTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTY TWELVE FILLS UP
Line_5147	THE MORNTHES FUN
Line_5148	YOU MOST A THREE HUNDRED THERE IS THREE MILLITERS
Line_5149	WELL IT IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE ME
Line_5150	USING THE WALL USING THE
Line_5151	S IS HOW MUCH OR HOLES
Line_5152	OH I OBSERVED A MOLUM
Line_5153	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5154	HENCE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN CAPACITY TO THE VERY TIPPY TOP
Line_5155	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN CAPACITY
Line_5156	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5157	YOU MAY L SEA THIS HOLE RE A CAT
Line_5158	IT CAN HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAN HOLD THAT CH THAT'S HOW IT SHOW
Line_5159	I DON'T KNOW I SHA DIG
Line_5160	THE CAMITTA BECAUSE WELL TWO DIFFERENT THING THREE LIKE S AND
Line_5161	ONE GA TO WHOLED FIFTY ONE COULD ONLY A HUNDRED ONE AN A THOUSAND WHICH ONE LATER
Line_5162	ALL WHAT'S GOING ON IS
Line_5163	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5164	THINK A JUST FROM GOD
Line_5165	IT HOLDS A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5166	YOU COULD USE THE LINERS OR BEAKERS OR CENTIMENALS LIKE THE
Line_5167	KINNISI ORANGE
Line_5168	OU PULL IT UP AND THE WATER FALL
Line_5169	OH IT'S HAVE FLOOR Y RIGHT NOW
Line_5170	MA OUR LIKE A PACITY
Line_5171	HUNDRED FORTY A THREE HUNDRED HORNS
Line_5172	YOU HAD UP HOW MUCH WATER WOULD HOLD AND IT'S HOLDING UP
Line_5173	BECAUSE THE WATER WAS JUST ON IT COULD I
Line_5174	AND WELL FELLS LIL HAND
Line_5175	OH THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
Line_5176	UM WELL EVERY SINGLE MINET THE TEMPERATURE DROPED WITH THE WITH THE CUP WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_5177	I FORGOT THAT
Line_5178	WELL I ONLY IT THAT'S COLD AND IT CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
Line_5179	WELL WE DID UM WELL EVERY MINETE WE WOULD CHACK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT AR THING
Line_5180	UM WE PUT IT UM HOW MUCH SOLCIES
Line_5181	IT SAY'S FIFT TEEN
Line_5182	WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE APP FOUR
Line_5183	WELL THEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IT
Line_5184	E OBSERVED TEN MINET
Line_5185	WELL IT CHANGES BECAUSE MISS FOLD AND YOUR A LITTLE FREE
Line_5186	UM IT GOES UP YEAH AND IT GOES DOWN
Line_5187	HI CLCIYES AND YEAH
Line_5188	I'LL CAN TELL YOU
Line_5189	WELL YOU SHOULD STREMILEY SEE THE I LIKE YOU COULD CAN YOU WAIT UP TIL WE'RE GOT TH
Line_5190	IT BLOWS YEAR AT SOL CA
Line_5191	ONE THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS TWEN
Line_5192	BUT WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GASS IN IT AND ON THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO UP
Line_5193	COOLED ON MILLAREA AND IT'S GOING TO GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
Line_5194	OH MY NAME IS SERA UM I REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
Line_5195	YES AND THEN REALLY EXCITED DID START
Line_5196	WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_5197	UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE
Line_5198	UM LIKE IS UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
Line_5199	THEY MAY COME UP WITH A DECISION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT STANDARD
Line_5200	IT SHOWS HOW LONG A METER IS AND UM HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_5201	MORE OR USED IN SCIETIPIC STUDY FOR LIKE REALLY LONG THINGS ARE REALLY SHORT THINGS AND YEAH
Line_5202	ALONG THE DORNOB IT'S FROM THE FLOOR
Line_5203	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE EMLECTRICK CISTOM OF THE WORLD
Line_5204	WELL WHAT OUR TEACHER SAYS IS USED HER PINKIE FIRST CENTIMETERS AND UTHUMIM PINKIE FOR ADDRESSITOVES
Line_5205	ON THE SA I DON'T KNOW
Line_5206	WELL THIS IS AN OLD SAYING PRACTIS MAKES PERFECT AND I HAP TO AGREE WITH IT
Line_5207	UM PRITY GOOD
Line_5208	WITH LIKE A METER OR RULAR OR A YARD STICK
Line_5209	TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL THINGS
Line_5210	YOU GET A MORE PROCICE ESTIMATE
Line_5211	WE MEASURED UM TO ARM FOOT UM
Line_5212	ROUBE'S NOSE IS WON PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIES FINGERS FINGER LEGS
Line_5213	I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT REFERENCE IS
Line_5214	UM I DON'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER PARTY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONES I'VE TOLD YOU
Line_5215	WE'VE BEEN SENDING THE STANDARDS SO TO AND OTHER IN SUSTANTS
Line_5216	YOU U I LE CAMPARING MASS WE DO MAS
Line_5217	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE METAL IS PROBABLY GONG TO BE THE HEAVIEST
Line_5218	THAT YOU COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND UN OR ANYWHERE
Line_5219	UM MEASUREMENTS MORE AC CURLY THAN THAT
Line_5220	EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHTS
Line_5221	TWO GUPS OR PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIP
Line_5222	HAVE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5223	WORLD GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS

Line_5239	GRAMS ARE UM A UNIT OF MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_5240	THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH GRAM PEST
Line_5241	HALIL
Line_5242	UM THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THE
Line_5243	YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT IS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5244	ITS THE SMAOLGER I'M GUESSING
Line_5245	OH IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSEND GRAN
Line_5246	WEIGHING HEAVER ER THINGS
Line_5247	IT IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5248	NO EVERYBODY YOU WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
Line_5249	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UM DIFFERENT LENGS SOME MASS
Line_5250	TWICE PUNCH THAT'S SPUNCH ONE THE SPOON
Line_5251	IT'S REALLY DRI AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WEIGH THAT MUCH
Line_5252	UM IT'S GONTOWEIG A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE SILK DO SPONED
Line_5253	UM I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SOKED SPONGE OR A WET SPUNGE BUT IT'S EVENLY NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
Line_5254	WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM LOGICALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF WHERE THE SPUNGE IS RIGHT
Line_5255	THE DRY SPUNGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	UH NOT MONCE
Line_5257	BUT DRY SPUNGES PEE GRAMS
Line_5258	IT IS SIX TEEN
Line_5259	UM YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH UMM
Line_5260	HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGHT HI WAY
Line_5261	AMS GRAMS I AM GOOD
Line_5262	I MERIPLE
Line_5263	GOOD
Line_5264	THE SAND LUGNETOFSCAW
Line_5265	YOU COULD WAY THE BOTTOM
Line_5266	GRAM PIECES AND AN OTHER CUP A LOT OF THIN
Line_5267	FORI LOST WHAT IS THE SAY
Line_5268	ISN'T THEN I VOL MASS AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVETYH YOU CAN ER AWAY TO THE SMALL OBJECTS WITH THIS
Line_5271	MLING IT PLYING IT BY A HUNDREDS
Line_5272	SMALL IT
Line_5273	THE THERMOMETERS UM COUNTING BY TUNS THIS IS COUNTING BY ONES AND THIS IS COUNTING BY A HUNDREDS
Line_5274	UHM THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN I SORRY
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR A LIQUID
Line_5277	COOKING BAKING I VOSED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5278	UM BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME A D A MILLIMETE LITERS MILLILITERS
Line_5279	SMALL OBJECTS OR ELIQUATED OBJECTS
Line_5280	IT ALL U MEA MOUNT IT'S A SMALL WAY THEN THE METER
Line_5281	ILE A MEASURING CUP A MIRTURING SCRIN
Line_5282	A BALANCE
Line_5283	CAPS CALLED BUT IT'S USED FOR MEDICINAN AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED THE A PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TA LIKE THAT
Line_5285	THE MILL LITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBERS THAT THE CERANGE HOLES IT THIS REALLY FUN THE SCREW UP
Line_5287	R VOICES ALOWED TO DAY BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	USE A SPILL BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW ONE TO OH THREE
Line_5289	SE ARE MILLAMETERS
Line_5290	WEITED SILINDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR SMALL OBJECT
Line_5292	S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLINLITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO D ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINES UM
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HAD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THAN YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A SORINCE YOU COULD BUY SORENDER IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL IT UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT HOW DO IT I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING TALLER BUT SKINNIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT WILL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM
Line_5301	THEY WE ARE ITHER TALLER BUT SKINIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZEROW
Line_5304	ONE MINE SAL IT TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN THIER DON'T WHAT ELSE COAL
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER I GOT TWENTY DEGREES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM TOP
Line_5308	UM I ON'T STAND YEAH
Line_5309	WELL SO I AM GOING TO MAKE IT REPEETE
Line_5310	I NEED STAREBOYS FIRST SEE
Line_5311	UM IT CHANGED RILLY QUICKLY I YEA
Line_5312	WE DREUGE IT ON GRASS PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE TO UM
Line_5314	ELL EXIS OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WELL YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UP UP HTHEWEY
Line_5317	IT'S TIME HOW MUCH A TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY AM GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WE AND IT UP
Line_5321	IT GOT IT WAS STUDED AT TWEMTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MA HIGH GUESS BY FIVE IT
Line_5323	JUST LIKE WING BY TONS OR FIFTEEN
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF ITS WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT FITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT UM TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE AND THE UM IT
Line_5328	COULD BI AM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT FUN
Line_5329	HOLOW MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH ROULERS YARD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
Line_5332	WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DISK AND WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT THE PERIMETER
Line_5333	I USED A YARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DESK
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH THOSE AND I THINK THERE STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'RES THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YOUD STICK OR A RULER THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVEAN NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETERS
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DE DECIMETERS AND A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WE MEASURED THE COMPCAPACITY OF A CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP U
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE CAPACITY
Line_5346	WE USED UM THE COMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU COULD POR IT AND A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRAJUTATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLALITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLI MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PRMCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACCAPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP R A WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	VE CUP THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5354	OU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S YOUOR IT'S HO IT'S THE FOUL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSILS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND CAPACITY
Line_5357	THAT TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE CAPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER B
Line_5361	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGR OUT HOW MUCH CAM WHAT THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE RMANS THAT THAT CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THE THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITER DIFFERENT IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLLIUME AND THE CAPACITY THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS ARE DIFFERENT
Line_5367	THE COMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLUME
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VOLIUME OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LEATERS AND THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLLITERS
Line_5372	IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5373	IT'S LABLED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THAT WS
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINIT
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARN
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOUME AND HOW MANY HAVE UM UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROP DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINNET
Line_5380	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT UP HIT AND THEN IT GOES PRITY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIERE AND HIERE AND HIER
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOW LEM MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRASS AND IT GETS WAMER
Line_5382	I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FOLLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	ARS IT WENT FROM TWENTY THE WEIGHT TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THING AND LENGTH AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO AND THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	HE'S TRYING TO FIGGER OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST PATRMWS IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
Line_5389	TO FIGGER OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINE SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SIDE
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINEST SIDE UM THREES A LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND IT
Line_5396	UM NO WHO
Line_5397	THE WIRES ARE A SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING THE COLLEGE SORT OF LIKE A HIGH WAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK IT DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM AH I WAIGHT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TWO TWO WIRES CIRCUIT S THINK I JUST
Line_5400	WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRES COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NO I I'S JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT ARIA WHERE THE NOCHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME OF
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TIPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	IS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB UPS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DO TH FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BUL ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	WA THE TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOME TIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	AND THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICK WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON VIRELANS STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STEEL LIKE THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THE WOOD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWERE IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DIDN'T OWAYS STICK ALL TIMES BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT ITS ONE'S A MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	OH THAT THE NE HELP JUST PINA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	E OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARTBORB IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS STICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO WELL
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FOUL THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY IT WON'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKIN SO I THINK IT JUST RIGHT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH THE
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE ELECELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WILL NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START START RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT'LL STARK GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE SCENE YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOLMOTOR WON'T START WORKING
Line_5446	WELL THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINE'S PLACED AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WHERE ON THE US PLACE SO IT'LL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IN
Line_5450	TO DAY I MADE POSTERS PIECE POSTERS
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPER AND THE MIDDLE AND THE MAGNET BILOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS UN UN THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY AND THE IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONE
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TO DAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PIECE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PIECE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THES OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WARE IS BAD TO BUT PIECE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE POSTERS OUT FOR PEACE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS YOU THE IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THAT ENERGY WOULDN'T GULD THROUGH SO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL OR THE ELECT ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT ON A BAT THE BAD WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINES
Line_5465	OH SINCE ICK CLICK DOWN THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSIT WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	S OR B OR S D YEA
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BAD RE WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULB CA
Line_5469	AND AND B AND AFTER YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE'VE BEEN MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR THE LAST THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE WE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPINGE
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE WAS ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE S D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIRGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DING CLASS
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAS PLACE TO GO
Line_5479	HE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOW IN TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT IS GOING OUT OF ITS NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD GOING UP IN THE OPPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE LA NO IT'S THE FLOW TO THE LEST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS EITHER BY DROPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPED THEM ON THE RIM CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A CIRTY AMOUNT WEIGHT
Line_5488	MONAWEIGHT BREAKES THE MAGNETIC WEAIVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC QUATER THEY CALLED
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WEAIVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS AND BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURN THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON THIS
Line_5492	UM I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINES IT HAS THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTRO MAGNET THE MORE POWURFUL ELECTRO MAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT THE ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	IT IT BUSED EAST AND AND THE POLIVIT SPUN AROUND AND SO C ELSE
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSED A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN AFFTHE LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARMAL LIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ON IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TUN ON ENNUFF
Line_5499	ENERGY SO IT CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT RUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TEN ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWES FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES TO AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULP
Line_5502	UM ONE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UM IT MAKES IT SO YOU THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	THE WINDED ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT IN A CIRCLE
Line_5505	WE RUBBED A PA CLIP ON A MAGNET THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5507	UM IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO ME SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL ALL TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH A REGUMAGNET YOU CAN DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER ST TOLD US BUT YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES A LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS I I JUST DON'T THINK IT WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAT SICK
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FAST TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE THE THE OPOSIT DIRECTION THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSIT WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	ECAUSE IT'S STILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM WOULD DO EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAID IT JUST SWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTORS FLAT RUNS
Line_5522	INSTEAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT'LL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WEIGHT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCH THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WAIT TILL IT LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
Line_5525	W YOU WON'T DO IT LIKE GONE
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS URWHAT THEY CALLED IT
Line_5529	WEI WHAT'S CALLED THE WALK PARA
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	WELL DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLE CELL KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT'S TO D NEAIBLE HEARD WEAR A SELARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICE THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRIGHT
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERIES THEY YOU COULDN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	YE CANT UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOOD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARAT AND ONE HAT I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
Line_5548	I THINK WILD SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNET
Line_5550	AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOX AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS CUBER
Line_5552	AND UM UM I FOR
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT EM SOMEHERE IN THE CABBOCKX AND WE TRYED TO FIND IT
Line_5554	OH WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPASS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX AND THEN WE CIERCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	THE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THERE IS A METAL OR A LIKE IT'S ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER A MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TEKNICALLY FINDS UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIN METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WHAT'S MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUP
Line_5561	Y USING LIKE A NEAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOCKX AND FIND IT TIL IT FIELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY UM STICK TO CERTAIN KINDS
Line_5563	IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHERE EVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NO IT DID NOT JUST KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLAIT
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5566	THE THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LETHEN SIDE THE PENSIL
Line_5567	YES SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEIR DOT IS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT A STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUITE SHOURE
Line_5571	YOU THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SHURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MATT A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I SANK AND THE
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON IT TURNS OFF
Line_5575	IT IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO UM MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD TO UM PLAY AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UH UM WA YEAH
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHIRCAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	HE ENERCHIEES UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	UM WE PUT IT UNDER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY OPINION I WOULD I I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE THING IN SIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THOSE LITTLE SAMBUS AND WE SAW UM IN A KEE AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH LIKE THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB IN ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE IS A LIGHT BUB THE IRONS AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	UM THE DRAMS RELATE BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WHERE'S SATTERD BUT IT GOES A WA FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	U IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY AND THI SLOW AND THEN HUOK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HOOKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLEAIT
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HUCKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL ON TO THE PLAIT
Line_5602	UM WELL AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE ARE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICED THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT IT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BUBTHEND COMES DOWN INTO THE OTHER ONE AND COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS A UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS THESE CIMBLES AND IT THE'RE ON THIS
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHURE BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM I'D NOT QUIT
Line_5616	WE MADE A MAGNET THAT CAN TURN OFF AND ON
Line_5617	UH WEIGHT WHAT AND
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE UM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE SO RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAGNET THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I'M NOT YET QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S U SPECIAL METAL BU I'M NOT QUITE SURE OF IT
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIED THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE USE JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT I NOT SURE IF I'M CORRECTED JUST IN MY OPINION
Line_5629	WELL IF THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WE ULL SO JUST WHEN I FORGET
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIED UM THE WIRE TOUCHING IT INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
Line_5632	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE ASK OR HELP FROM MIDARMOCINIE NE TOLD US TO Y WRAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT UM THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UN ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE MAKE THE LIGHTS TURNON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FUMELECOF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGHT MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	IT MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOU WILL NEED MOREYOU'RER
Line_5641	NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	YES YOU CAN STILL MAKE A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGER THEN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERYY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE WRONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE AND
Line_5648	IN THE WRONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE E
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY LY BE UN THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE AND THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I I YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WILLND WALK TWO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BULE UM THE
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRES SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5657	IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THERE
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE A SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	UM SO THE SO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5662	UM YES IT ISE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	WE NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMALAR TO THIS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAINST
Line_5670	YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORKED WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YES SCIENCE IS VERY QUIL
Line_5674	UM WE'RE SEEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	TIPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNET DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THERE ARE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHERS GOING INTO A CUP FIT UNHOOKED THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEN HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UN HOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING DCHACED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY O BEN DETRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT IT'S HAVING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PUTCH THE ONE WASHER THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATES THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GAS WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YES IT DOS TELL US
Line_5686	USHERS IT TAKES TO MAKE THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHERS IT TAKES TO BAKE THE FOSS
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHERS THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO PICK THE MAGNETIC FOURSE
Line_5689	I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HUD THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT IT SPUNGE
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BACHERY A BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WELL YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DIDN'T SCIENCE WHERE WE USED THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU WOULD PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BODLE MU CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
Line_5697	I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT THAT WHATEVER IS IN HERE IS THIS A LIGHT BULB I THINK
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S IT IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KIND LIKE A SCRAP RIGHT NOW
Line_5700	LECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPONING
Line_5704	NO IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND A PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	NEAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	T THE MAGNET CAN GO WITH THREE THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT COULD GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_5709	UM WE BILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEWHERE WE DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND OUT
Line_5710	WHEN THE MIDDLE SHAVINGS FROM THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE MAGNETS ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF THEN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARD BORD
Line_5713	UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	CAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HERE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNETS IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOULD KNOW WHERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNETS THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTATCHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE MIN OFF SWITCH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON AN OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE N ENOUGH SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR IS NOT IN A RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR WALL RUN
Line_5721	TOR IF THE MOTOR'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE SO WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DO I DO I FORG
Line_5723	IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	YOU WOULD PUT BOTH WIRES AT THE BOLM OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SEN IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCH UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM YEAH UM BECAUSE WE TRIED THAT ACCUPL OF TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THE'RE CALLED
Line_5731	UH NO ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	WELL THE WAY WE DID IT IS THAT SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECTED UM CONNECTED SO THE ELECTRO MAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRIC
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET UM IT WILL GO THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	ELECTRICITYS FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	POWER IS GETTING TROUBLE THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	THE REASON THAT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT ER TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MORNING IN SIENCE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASILY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT MIX THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5748	INSOLATION MEANS LIKE THE COPPER WIRE IS AND SIDE OF THE GREEN COATING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN ON A SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVET STAYS MAGNETIC
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND YES BUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME IT CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I OBSERVED WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CAN NOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NO WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNIN BY ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON THE CONE SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LETS GO APART
Line_5760	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WILL UM THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN IT
Line_5762	WACK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL ON THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM NOW IS ALUNIMUM ALUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPEALING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING THE PART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNETS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	I SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET TEST THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THEN NINTEEN WASHERS BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TWO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROBABLY SEPARATE QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACERS AND BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FORCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE PELLED THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU'LL GET A HIR NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS IN YOU'L GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
Line_5776	WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND DOWN JUST SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSDRUCTIONS AND BE CREATE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY D TURN ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THERE ARE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	M I FORGET IT'S NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN ES AND IT USES SIMBLES TO TELL UM INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE D TAILS
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	THIS SHOWS YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NE WIRES
Line_5785	YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TO DAY WE GET THIS FUN MISTER THING WITH WA FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	AND NO WIRES CONNECTED TO A B
Line_5788	HIDE MY NAME IS JONAWH
Line_5789	HI MY NAME IS JONA WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS
Line_5790	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM IN SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORK
Line_5791	WELL THE WIRES ARE A TOUCHED ABOUT ON AND THE AND THE ONE ON D
Line_5792	WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECT KEEPS THE CIRCUIT IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRADS THAT THE WIRES ATTATCHED TO OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
Line_5794	WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORK
Line_5795	UM THE CONDUCTORS
Line_5796	WELL GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UM WORK
Line_5797	WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTATCH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTATCHED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MISTERY BORD BY THE WIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
Line_5798	WELL THAT SOS THAT ON THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MISTORY BORD ARE CONNECTED FROM A TO SEE
Line_5799	WHILE A CIRCUIT IS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S MAKING SOMETHING WORK
Line_5800	UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU JUST ASK ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
Line_5801	UM THE BAT UM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5802	UM WELL JUST M MORE WA ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIKE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5803	I UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5804	I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5805	UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLA A BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5806	WELL WELL IT'S ALWAYS COMING IN THROUGH THE PLAS SIDE INTO THE INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5807	WELL IT ALWAYS COMES IN THROUGH THE PLAS SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5808	IT UM IT ALWAYS FLOWS OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND ALWAYS COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5809	WELL IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY THRUM AND THE PLAS SIDE SO YEAH
Line_5810	WELL IF THE B CUP IF IT'S TOO HEAVY IN THE B CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THAT IT'LL BRAKE THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5811	IF WE HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER AND OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
Line_5812	WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FOURCES PRITY STRONG
Line_5813	WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BRAKE THE FORCE
Line_5814	THEY'RE GETTING SPREAD APART
Line_5815	THE DISTANCE INCREASES
Line_5816	THE MAGNETIC FOR SLOWLY WEAKENS UNTILL IT'S NOT MAGNETIC UNTIL IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5817	WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO SPACES AT YOUR MATE
Line_5818	GROUP A GOOP GOOP D THEY ALL ARE PRTY MUCH THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT GROUP C JUST GOING TO THROUGH THEIR WASHERS IN AND BAD ORDER
Line_5819	WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5820	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING UH THIS CIRCUIT IS ONE BATTERY AND IT'S POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT ONCE
Line_5821	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5822	AND AH YEAH
Line_5823	WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAS ONE
Line_5824	EACH EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_5825	YEAH EACH GUM PONENT HAS THEIR OWN PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE OR THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5826	WELL THE BULB AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5827	WELL UM THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5828	WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5829	TWO PASTWAYS I THINK
Line_5830	THIS REPROSENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5831	IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5832	THAT UM THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE POW
Line_5833	WELL THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEARE IN THE BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
Line_5834	UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S PROBABLY A MAGNET IN IT
Line_5835	WELL TO MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAY IT'S GOING
Line_5836	WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISM IS UH LIKE WHAT THE FILINGS ARE GETTING PULLED TO
Line_5837	I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM CORNER
Line_5838	HE PAPER CLIP FLIES TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUSHING IS PUTTING IT IN
Line_5839	UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
Line_5840	WELL WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE MAGNET IT'LL START PINNING REAL HARD AND THEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING AT IT SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MAGNET
Line_5841	WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WERE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5842	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP AROUND THE CORN THE UM THE STRONGER THE ELECT THE UM MAGNET WILL BE
Line_5843	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5844	THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_5845	WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AN IRON CORD IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP LIKE WASHERS
Line_5846	UM WELL UM NOT SURE
Line_5847	THE UM COR WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE WASHERS
Line_5848	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
Line_5849	WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THE THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW SO THE THE CIRCUIT THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5850	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT WILL PICK UP FILL WASHERS
Line_5851	IF THE UM UM SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
Line_5852	THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET WORKS
Line_5853	WELL THE CORE MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO PULT THE WASHERS AWAY
Line_5854	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED ABOUT IT AND IT IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5855	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5856	WELL WE HAD A LATER A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE A AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_5857	WELL YOU HAVETO USE THE UM THE D CELL TO GET THE ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5858	IT PRITY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO YOU CAN SPIN AROUND CIRCUIT
Line_5859	I THINK THE REASON IT UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOURCE CHOUSED ABATTAL LIGHT BULB
Line_5860	WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GIDE IT THEY THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GIDES IT THROUGH
Line_5861	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULLB LIGHT
Line_5862	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_5863	LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_5864	I MEASURE WHAT CONTACT POINTS ARE
Line_5865	UM YOU CONNECTED HIM TO EACH CONTRACT FROM IT AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
Line_5866	WELL UH WELL UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THE SIDE
Line_5867	UM UM NOT SHORE
Line_5868	WELL A D CELL GIVES THE UM GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
Line_5869	HE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
Line_5870	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING THERE SO IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
Line_5871	UM THE CIRCUIT UM UM IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STARTS O UP AGAIN
Line_5872	WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PARK WHICH IS ATTATCHED TO A FLAG SO THE FLAG IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_5873	THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIT AROUND
Line_5874	IT'S MAKING THE FLAGS SPIN AROUND
Line_5875	UM IT REPROSENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GOING LIT
Line_5876	LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING ATTATCH THE CONTACT POINT SO IT'S GETTING LIT
Line_5877	UM THERE'S A MOTOR AT THE BOTTOM
Line_5878	IT HAS TO BE FLOWING TROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUNT THE CORD
Line_5879	WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE QUARMORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BAD REASON
Line_5880	UM AT SHOWING THAT IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED WINES IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5881	ONE HUNDRED MI WHAT WINES MEANS THAT WILL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5882	WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5883	UM IF YOU UN IF IT'S NOT AS WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
Line_5884	THE MORE WIN YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5885	WELL THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AROUND THE CAR AND MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5886	WELL THE UM THE MORE WIND YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT WILL PICK UP
Line_5887	WELL ONE WEIGHT OF STRENGTH IN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINDS AROUNT THE MORE TIMES
Line_5888	UH YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES
Line_5889	UM SOME F THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY
Line_5890	UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST IN KEEPS INCREASING AND THE MORE WASHERS YOU UM I MEAN THE MORE WIN YOU PUT
Line_5891	BECAUSE THE MORE IT'S TOUCH MORE TO CO TO ELECTRICITYES BIGGER THE ELECT THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS
Line_5892	IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD BIGGER
Line_5893	WELL UM THE MORE UM WIRE RAPS YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THEM MORE UH WASHERS
Line_5894	WELL IT'S YOGNING AH LIKE BE MORE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5895	WELL THE MORE WRAPSALL YOU DO THE HIRES THE DRA GET UM BECAUSE THAT'S OH WE'RE THE WASHERS U
Line_5896	UM THE FARTHER YOU RIGHT IT INCREASES TEN RAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIGHER
Line_5897	WELL WHEN THE NUMBER WRAPS GET LARGER THE THE DATA THE WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP
Line_5898	THERE UH INCREASING UM HOW MUCH YOU UM PICK UP
Line_5899	WELL THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU YET THE MORE WASHERS WASHERS SHOW PICK UP
Line_5900	WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THE WHEN IT'S NOT A STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
Line_5901	IT MEANS IT STRONGER
Line_5902	BECAUSE UH NINDY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE THOSE FIFTEEN RAMPS
Line_5903	WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TIPE OF CONDUCTOR IT IS
Line_5904	AND IT OPENS WHAT AN A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_5905	WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKE IT SPIN
Line_5906	MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5907	WELL IF YOU HAVE AN INSLITOR THE MOTOR'S NOT GOING TO WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONDUCTOR THE UM MOTOR WILL RUN
Line_5908	WELL WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO IT IT WILL JUST STOP WORKING
Line_5909	WELL SOMETIMES OF METAL STICK TO MAGNETS BUT NO PLASTIC WILL
Line_5910	WELL WELL THE NAIL ON THE RIGHT IS A STEEL NAIL AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS AN ALUMINIUM AND STEEL STICKS TO MAG MAGNETS BUT NOT ALUMINIUM
Line_5911	WELL THOSE ARE ARE STEEL AND UM IRON THEY WILL STICK TO A MAGNET AND CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_5912	WELL WE'VE BEEN BILDING CIRCUITS
Line_5913	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIRES ARE AND THE LITTLE BORD IT'S A PRITTY COOL EXPERIMENT
Line_5914	THERE IS THERE IS A WIRE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT D

Line_5917	WELL THE WIRE MUST BE FROM GOING THE THE WIRE OF THE MYSTERY BORD MUST BE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT B
Line_5918	YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE BRADS DON'T YOU
Line_5919	THEY'RE CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
Line_5920	THEY'RE MADE OF METAL AND AIR GOOD CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
Line_5921	YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE WIRES TO THE BRADS THAT ARE CONNECTING THE WIRE
Line_5922	THIS WOULD BE A CLOSED OR COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_5923	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5924	NOT FOR SO E
Line_5925	I DON'T REALLY KNOW OF WE CAN TELL YOU A OF IT
Line_5926	NOT REALLY NO I DIDN'T OBSERVE THE STICK STACK
Line_5927	THAT'S PROBABLY NOT BE BEING ABLE TO ATTRAPE THEIR NEIGHBOR CLIP VERY WELL SO THE PAPER CLIP IS JUST MEGA U
Line_5928	IRON AND STEEL CAN ATTRACT TO RA THE MAGNETL
Line_5929	DON'T REALLY KNOW UM STUMPED
Line_5930	THE NAIL MUST HAVE BEEN TEMPORARLY TURNED INTO A MAGNET SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5931	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5932	THROUG A PATHWAY TO A RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN
Line_5933	WELL THE PATHWAY IS A CONDUCTOR OR A WIRE
Line_5934	A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE OF ELECTRICITY BASICALLY
Line_5935	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRONS AND ARE ONLY LIKE THREE OF THEM AND THE LIGHT BULB AT A TIME
Line_5936	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE
Line_5937	IT'S FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5938	WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING FASTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER
Line_5939	THE ENERGY IS GOING FAST STIR
Line_5940	WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL IN THE CIRCUIT THE THE E
Line_5941	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER
Line_5942	THE BULBS LIGHT UP RIETER SO IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL YOU GET MORE LIGHT
Line_5943	WELL WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE D CELL THE
Line_5944	WELL PLUS IS AGAINST PLUS AND MINIS IS POINTING OUT
Line_5945	WELL WHEN YOU HAD MORE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5946	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS ABOUT TWO TIMES FASTER
Line_5947	THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5948	THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5949	WELL IN THIS SKIMATTIC THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5950	THE PARALLEL VERTICAL LINES UH REPRESENT BATTERIES
Line_5951	ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COAL
Line_5952	IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
Line_5953	WELL AND THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO BRAKE THE POLE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5954	WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC POLE BECOMES WEAKER
Line_5955	WELL THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT
Line_5956	NEXT TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE
Line_5957	GOOD HOW HOW ARE YOU
Line_5958	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5959	I THINK YOU'VE MADE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5960	WILL ONE ROLE OVER THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES UM GLOW GRENE
Line_5961	THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS FLOWS FROM THE MINES SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5962	IT GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLSE OR POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5963	EACH SIMBLE REPROESENTS A LIGHT BULB A BAT
Line_5964	IT REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BASICALLY
Line_5965	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE
Line_5966	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MEANS THE RECEIVERS EACH HAVE A SEPARET PATHWAY TO THE BATTERY
Line_5967	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH RECEIVER
Line_5968	WE'VE GOIN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5969	THERE'S A MAGNET INSIDE THE MISTERY BOX SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS
Line_5970	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO IRON
Line_5971	I CAN WELL THINK OF MUCH AND AN ANSER OF AN ANER
Line_5972	GREAT HOW ARE IS YOUR SELF
Line_5973	WE'VE BEEN MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5974	I LIKED ERICCRITY
Line_5975	BECAUSE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THERE IS MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5976	IT TWISTED AROUND COR
Line_5977	WELL IF YOU WRAP THE CORD WITH WIRE A MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED
Line_5978	WELL THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CONNECTING THE TWO WIRE CLIPS
Line_5979	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE SWITCHES ON

Line_6011	IT MUST BE A COMPLETE OR CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6012	WELL YOU JUST LINED THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE TIMES
Line_6013	IT MEANS THE WIRE THE WIRE HAS GONE A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE COAOR
Line_6014	WELL THERE ARE TEN THERE ARE TEN WINES FEER IT ONLY PICKS UP THREE WASHERS
Line_6015	WINED WIND THE WIRE AROUND SEE
Line_6016	THE NUMBER OF WASHERS YOU PICK UP GOES UP
Line_6017	WELL THE MORE WINES YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6018	THE MAGNETIC FIELD CREATED BY THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GETS STRONGER WITH THE MORE WRAPS YOU HAVE
Line_6019	THE ELECTRICITY IS CREATING A STRONGER MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_6020	NO DISPLAY MY AT DATE UH UM
Line_6021	BY RECORDING THE NUMBER OF WRAPS AND THE NUMBER OF WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_6022	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP
Line_6023	I THINK AGAIN THAT IT WOULD PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6024	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_6025	WELL THIS IS THE CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH IN IT
Line_6026	THE BRESS RING IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_6027	NO NOT ALL WERE OBJECT OR THE SAME SOME OBJECTS ARE CONDUCTORS OTHERS OR INSULATORS
Line_6028	WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THAT THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN

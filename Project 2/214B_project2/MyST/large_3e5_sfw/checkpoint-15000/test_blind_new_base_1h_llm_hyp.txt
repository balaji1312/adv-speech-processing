Line_0	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1	THE CAR IS
Line_2	THE WEALS CAN MOVE
Line_3	THERE IS LIKE THE DIGEST CYSTOM IT WAS LIKE THE BLUE VESILS IN THE HEART AND THERE IS LIKE THE BRAIN
Line_4	CAN YOU SEE THAT IT GO
Line_5	I SEE WATER LINE TREES THE SKIN CLOUDS HOUSES AND A MOUNTAIN
Line_6	ART
Line_7	THE LIFE AND ALL THINGS LIKE TREES AND PLANTS AND CORAL ON FISH AND YOU EVEN HUMAN
Line_8	L LIGHT
Line_9	I SEE A DESERT I SEE WELL A FORISTS I SEE
Line_10	THE LIGHT BLUE REPRESENTS THE WET LANDS THE YELLOW REPRESENTS THE DESERTS THE PURPLE WEARS AND LIKE THE FREEZING PLACES AND THE DARK GREEN REPRESENTS THE FORISTS
Line_11	WELL LET WET LANDS HAVE FROGS AND PLANS AND FISH DESERTS HAVE LIKE SCORPIONS AND SNAKES AND THE FORISTS HAVE LIKE BEARS AND LOSES AND TREES
Line_12	IT SHOWS ME LIKE A FOX A BUNNY A HUMAN A BIRD UM LIKE BUG A FLOWER LIKE MUTING GRASS OR LIKE I THINK THAT'S LIKE A MOUNT
Line_13	A FOOD WE
Line_14	IT IS WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS COULD GET EATEN BY LIKE AN ANIMALS FOOD AN ANIMALS CREATOR LIKE LIKE SO A BUNNY RABBIT IS LIKE FOOD FOR A SNAKE A SHOCK AND LIKE A LIKE A MUSHROOM IS MS YEATHERS MUSHROOMS AND THE LISEARD THERE IS LIKE BACTERIA GRASS BACTERIOUS FOOD FOR THE GRASS
Line_15	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_16	BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER SOME FUNGI IS A DECOMPOSER AND GRASS IS A PRODUCER
Line_17	BE
Line_18	OW YOU
Line_19	THE ONE WITH LIKE THE PLANT PLANTS AND SHELLS I THINK ARE THE LIKE PRODUCERS THE LIKE ONE WITH THE SHARKS THE BEAR AND THE MUNKIE AND THE HACK AND THE BIRD AND THE BUNNY AND THE FISH ARE THE BACTERIA AND FUNGI IS ARE LIKE TO CAN THE COMPOSERS
Line_20	I PRODUCE MY OWN BY LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS THAT'S MEAN TO ME IF O WERE A PRODUCER I WOULD PRODUCE MY ON ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS MY FUEL
Line_21	I AIR LIKE HAVE MY OWN FOOD LIKE FROM AN ANIMAL LIKE LIKE SO LET'S SAY IF I WERE WELL SOMETHING LIKE HAIR I WOULD EAT FOOD LIKE GRASS SOMETHING LIVING AND BY ONE OF MY PREDATORS WOULD BE LIKE A HOOK
Line_22	A D COMPOSER D CAN LIKE D COMPOSERS THERE WON'T FOOL LIKE A LIKE BROUGHT IN FOOD OR LIKE PAPER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_23	TE COMPOSTING ROOT AND FOOD AND THE FOOD THAT THEY DECOMPOSED GAVE THEM ENERGY
Line_24	SOME WILL SOME STUFF LIKE MAYBE FUNGI UM BAGATERIA
Line_25	THESE ARE LIKE PICTURES OF A D COM OF D COMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_26	THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WELL WE LIKE DO THE MORE AND KIND OF LIKE ON THE TOP THE FOUHINIGHTS ING
Line_27	ON THE VORE I THINK IS WELL IT EATS MEAT BUT ALSO EATS LIKE PLANT LIKE UH AND SEE LIKE BERRIES OR SOMETHING
Line_28	A ONE EATS ALL WELL SO IF ME IS THE PREFIX OF ALL THAT ALSO MEANS LIKE SO ON DEVOURS ARE ANIMALS THAT EATS ALL THINGS LIKE MEAT FRUITS AND VEGCTABLES
Line_29	A KIND OF WARM
Line_30	E HAND MOSS PETRI
Line_31	THAT HELPS THEM WITH THEIR FRUIT AND THAT IS PART OF AN ELECT
Line_32	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_33	HOW ARE YOU
Line_34	HOW IS THE EAST IS BLOWING AH OH IT'S LIKE MAKING THE BAG BIGGER MOTOR AND BUTTER BECAUSE IT LOVES THE AND CRACKER AND HIKE WET WON'T SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP
Line_35	A IS DREDING THING IN THE VISIT JUST LIKE A HUMAN BECAUSE I WOULD GET INTO THE IT'S GATHER ABOUT LET A F
Line_36	THE FACT THAT THAT IS LIKE MAYBE LIKE E WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE DACTERIAL AR SO LIKE LIKE BACTERIA FOR THEM
Line_37	THE CIRCLE ONE THAT EITHER SHOWED IS BILLY A ONE COMPANY IN BUT LIKE GOOD CHIPPED RAN TODAY AND THAT MARRY IT LOOKED LOCKLY LIKE OR BUT THE FIRST OF THAT EACH END OF THE D THE E
Line_38	WHEN YOU TOLD ALOHA
Line_39	SOME ARE
Line_40	L ACTUALLY NOT REALLY BECAUSE IF IT HAS THIS ONE THING IT HELPS HA MAKE WATER
Line_41	BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S THE FACT THAT A PLANT IS A LIVING THING AND IT NEEDS WATER THEN YOU CAN JUST ON TO STOP IT AND THEN BULB
Line_42	YES BECAUSE IT IS A BURGER ARE A THINK DE COMPOSERS WHICH THEY NEAD THIS KID DID NOT DE COMPOSE BUT THEY NEAD F LIKE BERGARS
Line_43	THAT PLANS FIT IN
Line_44	WHAT I
Line_45	NOW
Line_46	NO BECAUSE PLANTS USE FIRALIZER THEY DON'T HAVE TO USE IT
Line_47	YOU E
Line_48	IT NEEDS WIND IT NEEDS SOIL IT NEADS SUN AND IT NEDES THOSE IMPORTANT STUFF
Line_49	ANY CARBON DIOXIDE IN OCCIGION AND WHIT IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT HELPS THE SURVIVE AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE LIKE A PR
Line_50	THEY'RE LEAVES
Line_51	H WIND IT DOESN'T GET WATER NOR WIND NOR ON NOR CARTON SIDE WALKS LYE THAT'S ONLY JUST WHAT ITS LIKE WHEN IT GETS WATER A WHEN E
Line_52	IT IS ALSO DYING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE LAST ONE BUT IT IS NOT GETTING ANY WATER AND DON'T LIKE IT ALSO NEEDS THAT MATERIAL AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY WATER CAN ALL LIVE LIKE I SAID PROCEED IT'S LIFE
Line_53	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_54	YES
Line_55	ON
Line_56	PUILLARION'S
Line_57	THIS S CLUMP
Line_58	THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL PLAS SALT AND THERE BRIGHT BUL IS TELL CHEESE BULB
Line_59	BECAUSE WE HAVE GOOD BECAUSE ON A ONE THING THE
Line_60	BEAKER
Line_61	SLESH
Line_62	MILES ARE JUST LIKE HUMAN AMLES HOW TO S LIKE HUMEN LIKE HUMANS ARE IN TO AND THEY'RE ALLY THEY EAT OUT OF SKIN CELLS PLOZILES PRE CELL'S
Line_63	IT ARE BLOOD CELL
Line_64	I SEE MAYBE PLANT WHAT WELL A LEAF SEE A LEAF ME WELL THIS IS A PICTURE OF A LEAF BUL OF LEAF BULBS
Line_65	THE LEAF HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOOKING CELLS AND THE HUMAN HAS JUST LIKE THREE OR FOUR LOOK IN ONE BUT THE HUMAN ALSO HAS MELT BULBS IT'S LOOKING DIFFER
Line_66	THEY NEED WINGS THEY NEED A BODY HEAD DO YOU KNOW BLINK
Line_67	LIKE BOS ARE LIT
Line_68	WE DON'T
Line_69	BRING DOWN
Line_70	IT HAS A STUFF PROD STICK OR THAT'S LIKE IT'S ACID THAT UM AND THAT CONDEBURNS DOWN TO FOOD
Line_71	BUT HOW ARE YOU
Line_72	A BEE WELL WHO ALL ARE RUNNING ABOUT LIKE VANS AND THE LIVING CYSTIMS YOU NON'T LIKE THE VAN ZIDELEM AND FLOW UM
Line_73	A LEAF
Line_74	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE SHAPES M LIKE DIFFERENT WERE IT GOES AND LEAVES DIFFERENT SHAPE LIKE I REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WAS PARALLEL
Line_75	THERE THERE IS THREE TIMES THE EASE UM OR TWO OF THE I DON'T ONE OF THEM IS PARALLEL UWE THERE PALMATE
Line_76	WELL THESE HAVE VAINS LIKE THAT TRAVELED LIKE THE SAP OR SOME THAT REALLY THIS IS LIKE THE SAME THING HAS VAINS THAT RU WELL IN A WET BLUE PANTS
Line_77	IT OUT AMBLES AND HOW THEY GET CRACTY AND MOST OF THE SISTOM AND HOW THEY GET NOTICED
Line_78	TRIES I SEE LIKE HA ON SHAPES AND I SEE LIKE LOCKERS GRIPS
Line_79	DI SMELLS
Line_80	IT USES IT'S WEBBED FEETS TO UH LIKE PUSH WATER THAT MAKES IT SWING AND GO
Line_81	BECAUSE IT LIKES HOW BASICALLY CHOMP THE MEAT AND BRAKE IT DOWN TO LITTLE PIECES
Line_82	IT MAKES LIKE IT MAKES PEOPLE GUESS LIKE IT S BASICALLY SHOWING IT UNLIKE THE ANOTHER ANIMAL TO BACK OFF YOU NO
Line_83	GOOD I
Line_84	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE THERE IS TONS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE UP WHAT ONE TONS OF LITTLE SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE HUGE SISTOM
Line_85	A CAR COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF AWAY WE MOVE AROUND LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND IT RELATES TO OUR SCIENCE PLA OUR SCIENCE SCIENCE RAN A BECAUSE THERE IS A MOTOR AND LIKE WHEELS AND STUFF AND N STUFF THAT MAKES IT A BIG SICITIUM
Line_86	THE MOTOR AND I THINK THE MOTOR MAKES IT GO THE S THEN THAT JUST LETS OUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEAED IN THE CAR AND THE WEALS AND THE WEALS ARE WHAT MAKES THE CAR MOVES
Line_87	IT HUMAN AND A HUMAN HAS SISTMS LIKE YOUR MUSCLES AND YOUR HEART IN YOUR ARMS AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN AND NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF ANIMAL OR SOME THIN
Line_88	IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN WE WOULDN'T BE WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW LIKE IF WE COULD MOVE OR ANYTHING CAUSE WE WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO THINK AND WITH OUR HEART IT WORKS TOGETHER TO GET BLOOD TO THE BRAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THEN OUR BRAIN HELPS THIS MIXTURE THAT WE CAN EAT FOR OUR STOMMICK
Line_89	THE EARTH IS A SISTM IT'S BECAUSE OF LIKE ALL THE SFEERS LIKE THE HIDE FER THE GEEOSFEER AND THE BIO FERN AND THE HIDE AND THE ATMOUSFERE BUT UM THESE ARE THOSE LITTLE UM SUB SISTOMS THAT MAKE UP ONE VEG SIYSTOM CALLED EARTH
Line_90	YES I DO THINK IT'S A SISTOM BECAUSE THERE IS THE HIDROSFER AND THE GO SAFER AND THE ATMOSFER AND THE BIO SFERE AND THAT ALL MAKES A BIG SNOW
Line_91	O THE BIO SFEER IS THE LIGHT AND THEN OH AND LIKE THE TREES AND PLANTS AND STUFF AND THE HIDRASFEERE IS THE WATER AND WE AND THE BIO SFEER NEEDS THE WATER SO THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND THE ATMAUSSFEER IS LIKE THE AIR AND THE SKI SO AND THEN THE GEE SFEERE IS JUST THE LAND AND WE NEED THE GEE S THAT THE BIO SFEERE NEEDS THE GEEOSFEERE SO THAT THEY CAN WALK ON IT THE BIROSFERE NEEDS THE HIDRASFEER WE AND THE BIO SFERE NEEDS THE ATMOSFER BECAUSE WE NEEDS SOME OF THE AIR THAT'S UP THERE AND THE HIM WHATEVER THE STUFF BE BREE AND WE NEED THE HIDRASFEER BECAUSE WE DRINK IT
Line_92	I SEE HOUSES AND HOUSES USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN IT SO THAT WOULD BE PUR OF THE IRON S FER AND THE TREES THAT'S ALSO BY SPEER AND THEN I SEE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THAT BIG BROWN MOUNTAIN RIGHT IN THE FRONT AND THAT WOULD BE THE DO FER I CAN SEE THE SKI WHICH IS THE HIGH NOT HIGH ATMOUSFER AND THEN THE WATER RIGHT UM ON THE BOTTOM IT'S THE HIGDRAB SFEER
Line_93	THE EARTH
Line_94	THERE ARE OR COMES THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIDRASFERE AND THAT'S THE WATER THE SECOND ONES THE DEER SFEERE AND TESTS THE LAND THE THIRD ONE IS THE BIOSFERE AND THAT'S THE LIFE LIKE PEOPLE IN TREES AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE ATMOSFEERE I NO THERE'S FIVE AND THEN THE LAST ONE'S THE ATMOSFEERE WHICH IS LIKE THE SKI
Line_95	I SEE A A LOT OF LIKE WIFE AND WHAT'S AND WHAT LIVES AND THAT ONES SPOT LIKE ANIMALS OR TREES OR SOMETHING
Line_96	WITH OUT THE WET LANDS THE ANIMALS WOULD DIE BECAUSE THEY NEED WATER AND WITHOUT LIKE THE DESERTS AND STUFF THEY WELL ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WETLANDS AND DESERTS ACTUALLY SO THAT WOULD DESTROY THEIR HAPPE A SO IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FAR TO THE ANIMALS
Line_97	THERE IS LIKE FOR AND STUFF WHICH BEARS USUALLY LIVE IN THERE IS LIKE TUNDRES WHICH IS LIKE THE SNOWY PLACES AND THE SNOWY PLACE IS WHAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE LIKE IF THE HI DRESFEER WASN'T HERE BECAUSE THAT THE HI DRESFEER WE WOULD NEED THE SNOW PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SNOW IS SOSNOW IS LIKE ICE SO THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT
Line_98	IT THERE IS LIKE UM ANIMALS AND IT THINKS A FOOD WA BECAUSE THERE IS THE GRASS AND WHAT EATS THE GRASS AND THE BUT THE GRASS EATS AND THEN THERE IS LIKE THE HUNTERS AND THE FOXES AND STUFF SO I THINK IT'S A FOOD WA
Line_99	FOBLADE A FOOD WEB
Line_100	WHAT EATS WE AND W WHAT THAT THING EATS LIKE WHAT EATS AND WHAT DOESN'T EATS ANY THING AND JUST GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_101	I THINK THEY'RE LIKE IT THE ARROWS MEAN WHAT EATS THAT ONE THIN SO SORT OF JUST TEACHES ME LIKE HOW TO DO IT LIKE IT SHOWS ME LIKE IF I HAD LIKE A TEST OR SOMETHING AND IT SAID WHAT DOES THE BUNNY EAT I COULD LOK AT A FOODWAMB AND IT SHOWS THAT FUNNEST EAT GRASS SO IT SHOWS IT SHOWS YOU WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_102	THE ANIMALS AND THE FUNGI IS STUFF IN THE MILES AND GRASLING PINE CON AND STUFF
Line_103	HERE IT SHOWS LIKE FUNGI FUNGI S E WE FUNGI GETS EATEN BY PINE CONES AND PINGLOBS GET PINE CONES GET EATEN BY THE BARK BEETLES AND THE BARK BEETLES GET EN BY THE BY BY THE SALAMANDER AND THEN THE SALIMENTORS EATEN BY THE SNAKE AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RA AND THE AND THE RABBIT EATS THE GRASS BUT THEN THE RABBIT ALSO GETS EATEN BY HOT RED TAIL HOCKS AND THE AND SPERROWS ARE EATEN BY RED TAIL HOCKS SO IT'S SPACICALLY JUST A BIG THING THAT TELLS YOU WHAT EATS W AND WHAT DOES IT WE AND ALL SOURCE OF OR CORE THING'S
Line_104	FUN
Line_105	I I'VE BEEN STUDYING PLANTS AND WHAT THEY DO IN THE DARK OR IN THE LIGHT
Line_106	UM THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BECAUSE EST IS A LIVING THING AND SINCE WE'RE CERTAIN LI WORK SINCE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIVING THINGS AND SISTOMS THAT'S SINCE SINCE EST IS A LIVING THING WHEN THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT NEEDS TO EAT AND DRINK EXCEPT FOR A EST IS STORMANT SO IF YOU GIVE IT WATER AND FOOD IT WILL IT'LL BREATH AND THE BAG THAT YOU HAVE IT IT WILT PROOF UP
Line_107	UM THE EASE ET HAS TO EAT BECAUSE IT'S LIVING AND THE EASE ALSO HAS TO DRINK CAUSE IT'S LIVING BECAUSE IT'S LIVING SO AND IT'S DORMANT SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN AND THEN SCREE WILL PUT AT THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THEN YOU CAN THEN THE EASE WILL WAKE UP AND IT'LL STOP BREATHING SO THE BAG WILL POO
Line_108	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE NOW AND THEY'RE BREATHING BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE DOT IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE WHERE THEY BREATH AND WHEN THEY BREATH WHEREVER THEY ARE IF IT'S IN LIKE A PLASTIC BAG THEN THE BAL POOF UP CELS SO THAT THEY'RE BREETHING
Line_109	GRASS IS ALSO A LIVING THING AND IF GRASS AND IF AND IF GRASS IS A LIVING THING WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GETS HIS FOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T GO BUBBLE UP ANIMALS SO MAY SO MAYBE WE COULD SO MAYBE IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT WE WOULD MAYBE WE COULD WELL SINCE A SLIVING THING MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT CONNECTS
Line_110	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO IT'S TURNING YELLOW AND SOON IT PROBABLY WON'T IT WON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN SO IT WILL HAVE SO IT'LL DIE
Line_111	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US THAT THE SUN SHINES ON THE PLANT AND THEN THE THEN SOMEONE'S WATERING IT AND THE WATER GIVES IT THE WATER AND THE THEN THE WATER AND THE SUN AND GIVES IT IT'S FOOD AND IT'S WATER
Line_112	YES
Line_113	ACTUALLY WELL YEAH I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WATER HELP AND SUNLIGHT GIVES THE MAKES IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SHOOGER AND SHOOGER IS THEIR FOODS
Line_114	ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY DON'T BECAUSE THE SUN THE POINT REALLY JUST NEEDS THE NEW TRANCH FROM THE SOIL AND THE SUN AND IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF YOU PUT IT ON THERE IF THIS IS THE SUN GOES ON TO THE LEAF AND IT'LL OBSORB THE SUN AND THAT WILL MAKE SHOGAR AND THAT'S A FOOD
Line_115	UM I THINK THE PLANT MEANS THAT I DON'T KNOW YEAH I THINK THAT PLANT NEEDS THE AIR BECAUSE WELL ACTUALLY KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED THE AIR AND UM I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET BECAUSE THE PLANT DOESN'T REALLY GET ANYTHING FROM THE AIR BUT IT GETS STUFF FROM THE SUN AND FROM WATER AND THE DIRT
Line_116	THAT WE BREATH AIR OH AND THE PLANS THE PLAN THE PLANS ANT BREATHS OR SOMETHING BREATHS THE CARBON DIOCIDE AT IRON THAT WE BREATH OUT
Line_117	YES
Line_118	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE WE BREE THE AIR THAT THEY MAKE AND THEY AND THEY BRETH THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT WE MAKE
Line_119	IT'S THE SUN AND PLANTS NEED THE SUN TO SERVIVE BECAUSE WITH OUT THE SUNLIGHT THEY WON'T BE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GREEN BECAUSE THE SUN HELPS THEM LOOK GREEN AND AND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SHOGER AND SHOGER IS LIKE THEIR FOODS
Line_120	YES
Line_121	YEAH IT WOULD IT COULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE IN OUR EXPERIMENT THAT WE'RE DOING PLANT PLANTS NEED SUN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE SUN THEY CAN PRODUCE SHOGER AND IF THEY CAN PRODUCE SHIGAER WHICH IS THEIR FOOD THEY WON'T THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
Line_122	I SEE A HAMBURGER AND A HAMBURGER IS SOMETHING THAT PLANTS ARE NOT GOING TO NEED BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN FOOD AND THEY DON'T REALLY EAT HUMAN FOOD
Line_123	UM IF WE DON'T FEED FOOD THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM UM IF IT WASN'T MAKING IT'S OWN FOOD THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
Line_124	YES I THINK THEY DO NEED FIRTALISER BECAUSE FIRTALISER IT'S LIKE THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE IN IT WITHOUT THE DIRT THAT THEY'RE AND THEY WON'T REALLY GET THE NEW TRANS FROM IT SO YES THEY DO NEAD A FERTILIZER
Line_125	IT'S A HOUSE AND THE I THINK PLANTS ARE GOING TO NEED A HOUSE BECAUSE A HOUSE H USUALLY HAS A BACK YARD AND IF IT HAS A BACK YARD THAT MEANS THERE'S PROBABLY DIRT AND THAT'S SOMEWHERE YOU CAN PLANT THE PLANT AND IF YOU PLANT IT THEN IT CAN GROW AND PRODUCE FOOD
Line_126	PLANTS PLANTS PROBABLY DON'T NEED ANY SHELTER BECAUSE THAT IF IT RAINS THAT GIVES THE WATER WHICH IS A GOOD THING AND THEN WHEN IT'S SUNNY THAT IT GIVES THE THE SUN AND THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_127	NO BECAUSE PLANTS NEED WATER SO IF IT'S RAINING THAT'S A GOOD THING CAUSE THEY'LL GET THE WATER AND THE PLANTS ALSO NEED THE SUN SO IF IT'S REALLY HOT AND SUN THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING
Line_128	IT'S THE SUN IT'S THE SUN GIVING OFF SOME OF IT'S LIGHT TO THE PLANT AND THE PLANT GETTING FROM THE COVER DOCSIDE N AND NEW TRANS FROM THE DIRT IN IT'S REUTS AND IT TURNS IT INTO THE AIR WE BREETH
Line_129	I THINK IT NEEDS AIR WATER AND SUNLIGHT BECAUSE WATER GIVES IT SOMETHING TO DRINK THE SUNLIGHT GIVES IT GIVES IT ITS FOOD BECAUSE IT GETS THAT THROUGH FOO SIMPHECIS AND THE CARBON OCSIDE IT IT USES THAT'S LIKE WHAT IT BREETHS AND IT BRINGS OUT AS IT BREATHS OUT OCSIGION AND THAT'S WHAT WE BREETH SO ACTUALLY TALKING WITH PLANTS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY NEED TO COME DOCSIDE CARBON D OCSIDE AND WHEN WE SPEAK WE LET SOME OF OUR CARBON D OCSIDE OUT AND THEN THEY'LL PRODUCE OCSIGIEN FOR US
Line_130	THEY OBSORBED THE SUNLIGHT AND THEY NEED THEIR COVER OCSIDES SO THAT THEY CAN BREATHE AND THE WATER AND THEY TURN THAT INTO SHOGER AND THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY EAT AND THEN THEY RED OUT THE OCSIGEN AND THAT'S THE STUFF WE BREATH
Line_131	YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BECAUSE THE THEY TAKE THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THEIR LIGHT AND THEN THEY MAKE THAT IN SOME FOOD AND THEN THEY BREE THE UM THE ASIDE AND THEN THE WATER'S JUST THE WATER THROUGH THE
Line_132	IT'S NOT GETTING ANY SUN SO IT'S NOT REALLY U SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN AND IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANY OF THE THINGS IN PRODUCE SHOOGER BECAUSE THE SUN IS WHAT GIVES IT THE SHOOGER SO IT'S DIGING
Line_133	DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUN SO IT CAN MAKE IT'S FOOD IF IT CAN MAKE IT'S FOOD THEN IT CAN REALLY UM IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EATEN IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO CAN EAT IT'LL DIVE
Line_134	NOT ENOUGH SO IT
Line_135	UM IT'S NOT GETTING ANY WIND OR AIR AND WITHOUT THE WIND OR AIR IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATH SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BREATHE IT'S JUST GOING TO DIE
Line_136	IT CAN BREATHE SO IT DIES
Line_137	IT'S STARTING TO SHRIVEL UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER AND WITHOUT WATER IT CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WE NEED WATER AND FOR WATER FOOD AND AN OCIGON TO TO SERVIVE AND WITHOUT JUST ONE OF THOSE SOMETIMES WE COULD DIE
Line_138	IT'S GROWING BECAUSE IT HAS THE SUN THE OCCIGEN AND THE WATER IT NEEDS TO LIVE AND GROW AND SO IT'S EATING IT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND IT CAN BREATHE SO IT'S ABLE TO GROW
Line_139	WHO HAS THREE PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE ALL THROUGH THE THINGS IT NEEDED SO THAT SO THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY THEY COULDN'T REALLY PRODUCE THEIR FOOD OR DRINK OR BREATH THE OCIGIN THAT THEY NEAD BUT NOW THIS ONE HAS ALL OF IT SO THAT IT CAN BREATH THE OCIGIN IT CAN EAT AND IT CAN DRINK SO THAT MEANS THIS ONE'S GOING BE HEALTHIER THAN THOSE OTHER ONES
Line_140	IT STARTS OUT AS WHAT EATS IT'S OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER EAT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THAT'S AND IF IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLANTS
Line_141	GOOFED
Line_142	LIKE MAPLE TREES MAP BELIEAVES MAPBELEEEVES AND THEN THERE IS LIKE PARALLEL LEAVES AND THAT'S JUST LIKE THE VANS AND THEN THERE IS THERE'S ALSO LEAVES WHERE ONE HAS WELL THERE'S ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN VAINS THAT COME OUT OUT OF THAT AND THEN MORE VAINS COME THROUGH THAT AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THEN T JUST VAN ONE VAN COMING OUT OF IT
Line_143	ONES FANS ARE PARALLEL THE OTHER ONES ARE THEY GO STRAIGHT THE ONE THERE'S ONE VAN THAT GOES STRAIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS AND THEN ONE HAS THERE IS MORE THAN LIKE ONE VAINVAIN BECAUSE THEN THERE IS MORE COMING OUT OF THOSE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE THAT JUST HAS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN ONE GAIN COMING OUT OF BUT IN TALL DIFFERENT SPOTS
Line_144	ONE S JUST HAS A TU JUST A UN OF THE VAINS GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER TO HAVE ONE GOING STRAIGHT AND THEN MORE GOING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE MORE COMING OUT OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE ONE WE'RE JUST GO STRAIGHT AND THEN ONE OUT OF THAT BUT THEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OUT OF ANYMORE EXCEPT FOR THAT
Line_145	ON ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PARALLEL IS PARALLEL UM AND THEN THE OTHER TWO ARE AND THEY AND THEY HAVE WELL SOME ARE A LITTLE BIT PARALLEL BUT UM THEN IT THERE IS ONE MAIN VAIN AND THEN IN ONE AND THEN A FEW OTHER VAINS COMING OUT OF THE MAIN VAN BUT THEN NOTHING COMING OUT WITH THE OTHER VAINS AND THEN THERE IS ONE WITH THE UM NOT WITH THE MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS MORE VAINS COMING OUT ALL OVER
Line_146	THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS PINNATE UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FEATHER IT HAS ONE MAIN VAN AND THINGS COMING AND VAINS COMING OUT OF THAT ONE MAIN THING BUT THAT NO VAIN'S COMING OUT THOSE ONES THAT ARNT THE MAIN THING AND THEN PALMATE IS LIKE YOUR HAND AND IT HAS A UN OF VANS ALL OVER SO THERE IS AND THERE IT'S MORE THAN ONE MAIN VAN SO THAT MEANS THERE IS AN EXTRA VAINS AND THEN PARALLEL IS JUST A TURN PARALLEL VAN
Line_147	THIS IS THE THIS IS THE THIS IS THE PINE AND IT JUST HAS IT HAS ONE MAIN VAINE AND THEN MORE VAIN'S COMING OUT THAT ONE MAY BE
Line_148	THE DIFFERENT TYPES LEAVES PRODUCES MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE LESS SHOGER AND IT'S JUST THE WAY THE PLANT IS OR AND IT HELPS IT GROW IN A DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_149	TO CARRY SHIGER TO TO ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANTS AND I THINK IT CARRIES IT TO THE ROOTS FIRST SO THAT THE ROUTE CAN SEND IT UP AND MORE VAINS UP TO LIKE ALL THE BE ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLANETS
Line_150	I THINK IT'S THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANS AND THE BLUE ONE CARRIES WATER AND THEN THE YELLOW ONE CARRIES LIKE ALL THE SHOOGER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT
Line_151	I THINK THE BANDS IN THE LEAVES HOW ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE THAT MAKE THE SHOGER FROM THE FOO SIMTHICIC AND ONCE THAT COMES INTO THAT US TO THE PLANT IT TURNS IT INTO THE FOOD AND SO THAT IT CAN READ IT SELF IN EVERYTHING
Line_152	SO I THINK IT SHOWING THAT THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VAN AND ONE IS CALLED THE POLUM AND IT CARRIES SAP OR SHOGER TO THE PLANTS AND THE THE OTHER ONE IS FILM AND IT CARRIES WATER TO THE REST OF THE PLANT BUT THEN I THINK I THINK THE PICTURE IS SHOWING THE WATER DOESN'T STICK IN I THINK IT EVAPORATES S
Line_153	WELL THE WATER IS GOING UP TO THE REST OF THE PLANTS THROUGH ONE VAN AND I THINK THAT'S THIS ILUM AND THEN ALL THE NEW TREENTS AND SAP MAYBE AND SHOOGER IS GOING THROUGH THE THE FOLUM UM TO THE ROUTE S
Line_154	IT HAS TO DO WITH THE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WATER GOES UP UNTIL THE LEAVES EVERYTHING BUT THEN IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE AROUND LIKE OUR BLOOD WOOD IT IT EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S A PLASTIC BAG AROUND THE BRANCH THAT PROVES THAT IT JUST COMES OFF I EVAPORATES
Line_155	IT CAME FROM THE PLANT AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE PLANTS DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WATER CIRCULATE BACK THROUGH IT JUST LESS THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_156	IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE WATER EVAPORATING AND SO THAT KEEPS IT IN WAIST BUT BECAUSE IN THE BAG BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR THAT IT HAS
Line_157	I THINK IT EVAPORATED INTO THE V BECAUSE THE PLANT UM THEY USE THE WATER BUT THEN THEY DON'T REA CIRCULATE IT SO IT JUST EVAPORATES OFF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE PLANTS IT JUST EVAPORATES INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS WATER ON THAT
Line_158	PBIE
Line_159	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_160	WELL WE'VE ALSO KIND OF BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF LIVING SISTOMS AND HOW WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SO LIKE A SKUNK IS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND ITURNALS ATTRACTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND SORT OF C
Line_161	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN COLORS AND SHAPES AND PROBABLY DIFFERENT DISTOMS ALMOST THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT ONE ANIMAL
Line_162	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE REALLY ATTRACTED TO OR A CERTAIN COLOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE LIKE A WARNING NOT TO EAT THAT ANIMAL OR SOME
Line_163	DIFFERENT COLORS AND STUFF IS PROBABLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTRACTED TO SO I THINK SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE COLORS IT'S WHAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO AND NOT ATTRACTED TO
Line_164	WELL TURTALS THEY LIKE TO THEY UM THEY'RE UP ON LAMPS SOMETIMES AND OTHER TURTLES CAN UM AND THEY KIND OF CAMFLISAMFLSE SOMETIMES BUT UM YOU CAN TURTLE LIKE TURTAL WELL TURTALS THEY CAN BE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER AND THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO OTHER TURTALES WHICH THEY HAVE THEIR KIND OF SHELL AND SO TEST CAN SEE EACH OTHER AND THEN THE FISH ARE REALLY BRIGHTLY COLORED AND THAT MIGHT MEANS DON'T EAT ME TO CREST AND THE OATION OR THEY JUST WANT TO FIND THE MATES AND THEN SCS THEY HAVE WHIGHT THEIR WHIT AND BLACK AND THAT'S PROBABLY TO SHOW HA DON'T COME NEAR ME OR OR ILL LEAVE STICK EVERYWHERE SO
Line_165	YES I DON
Line_166	UM THE ANIMALS DON'T WANT TO EAT THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SPRAYED SO THAT HELPS THE SKUNK STAKE ALIVE
Line_167	OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS IT HAS A SHELL AND SINCE IT HAS A SHELL THAT CAN KEEP THAT CAN KEEP PREDATORS FROM GETTING INTO IT SO IT CAN HEIGHT IN THAT SHELL SO THAT THE PREDATORS CAN'T EATS IT
Line_168	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO LIKE SAY I'M ATTRACTED TO BLUE FETHERS AH IF I SAW BLUE FETHERS THAT BE ATCCRIP ATTRACTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ALL SORTS ANIMALS THAT HAVE COLORS TO WARN THINGS HA I'M POISONS OR HA A METAL IF YOU COME NEAR ME I'M GOING TO SPRAY YOU OR A YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I DON'T TASTE GOOD SOME LIKE THAT SO THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN EARNING ABOUT
Line_169	THE FEET BECAUSE IF THE DUCK DIDN'T HAVE FEET WEBBED FEET IT COULDN'T PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER AND IF IT COULDN'T PADDLE THROUGH THE WATER IT WOULD PROBABLY SINK SO YEAH THEN FEET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
Line_170	I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP AND IF IF THE LIONS DON'T HAVE THEIR TEETH IT WOULD JUST BE GUM AND WITHOUT IT AND WITHOUT THE TEETH IT THEY CAN EXACTLY LIKE GRAB AND ANTILOPE OR SOMETHING TO EAT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TEETH SO ALL IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD JUST KIND OF SMOKE IT A LITTLE B
Line_171	BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TEETH IT'S JUST M AND AND IT AND A I CAN'T BIGHT THINGS TO KILL IT SO THAT IT CAN EAT IT IT WAS JUST UM BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY SMOOSH THE SKIN A LITTLE BIT IT BE LIKE YOU COVERING YOUR TEETH WITH THE MEOUR LIPS ALMOST UM THEN BIGHNING YOUR HAND IT DOESN'T HEART AS MUCH AS IF YOU JUST BIT IT
Line_172	THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HAS A SPECIAL DESIGN THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT MIGHT EVEN LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BIT ER THAN I BUT SOM BRIGHT COLORS MEAN HA YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME I'M POISONS EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE POISONOUS
Line_173	RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE THEIR TAIL WHEN SOME OR SOME THING GETS CLOSED BECAUSE THEN AND THEN THAT TELLS M HA I'M HERE AND DON'T STEP ON ME OR I MIGHT BUG YOU
Line_174	WELL THE PERSON WALKED UP AND THEN RAP THE RATTLE SICK SURE SHAKING HIS TAIL AND BY SHAKING THE TAPE ITS TAIL THAT WARNED THE PERSON NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER BECAUSE THE SNAKE MIGHT STRIKE
Line_175	THE HUMAN KNOWES THAT IF IT GETS ANY CLOSER THE RATTLE SNAKE WILL STRIKE AND BRIGHT YOU AND IF IT BIGHTS YOU IT PUTS POISON IN YOU SO THAT COULD KILL YOU AL ALMOST SO IF YOU HEAR THE SNAKES RATTLE ITS TAIL THAT MEANS DON'T COME ANY CLOSER ALL BY YOU
Line_176	IF THE PERSON WAKES UP IT SHAKES ITS TAIL SO THE PERSON STOPS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT TO GET BE BECAUSE IF IT BIGHTS HER SHE COULD TH AND THAT KEEPS THE SNAKE SAFE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FOR ALL CREDTORS
Line_177	THAT KIOTY KNOWS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT THE SKUNK COULD SPREAD IT BECAUSE IT'S PUTTING UP IT'S TAIL AND IT HAS THE WEIGHT AND THE BLACK AND THE STRIPES SO THAT KIOTY KNOWS TO STAY AWAY OR IT'S GOING GET SPREAD AND IT'S GOIN TO STICK FOR DAYS

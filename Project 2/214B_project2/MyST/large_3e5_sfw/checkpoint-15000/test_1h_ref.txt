Line_0	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND LIKE YOUR BODY IS A SYSTEM A SUITCASE IS A SYSTEM AND THE EARTH IS A
Line_1	A CAR A SUITCASE THE EARTH A HUMAN BODY
Line_2	A CAR IS A SYSTEM WITH THE MANY PARTS LIKE THE WHEEL
Line_3	THE CAR HAS MANY PARTS LIKE THE EXHAUST
Line_4	THE MANY PARTS IT HAS
Line_5	WHEEL HELPS IT ROLL
Line_6	HUMAN BODY IS ALSO A SYSTEM
Line_7	IT SHOWS ME PART OF PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND WHAT MAKES IT A
Line_8	ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE HEART CONNECTS TO AND THE BLOOD VESSEL
Line_9	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKES IT A SYSTEM
Line_10	THE EARTH IS ALSO A SYSTEM
Line_11	IT IT HAS LAND IT ALSO HAS WATER AND IT HAS THE FOUR SPHERES
Line_12	YES BECAUSE EARTH HAS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE UP EARTH
Line_13	WELL THE TREES ARE PART OF THE
Line_14	SAND AND PLACES LIKE
Line_15	THE BIOSPHERE IS PART OF EARTH AND EARTH IS AN ECOSYSTEM
Line_16	THIS PICTURE SHOWS ME A MAYBE A FOOD WEB OR AND LIFE
Line_17	WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS GET EATEN BY UM ANIMALS ARE PART OF THE BIOSPHERE
Line_18	A PINE TREE AND PRODUCES IT'S FOOD
Line_19	ABOUT DECOMPOSER CONSUMERS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE PRODUCERS
Line_20	THIS SHOWS US CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSER
Line_21	DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS
Line_22	WHEN THEY EAT THE FOOD THE ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_23	CONSUMERS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND CONSUMERS CAN GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_24	A CONSUMER THAT EATS ANOTHER ANIMAL OR A CONSUMER THAT THE ANIMAL GETS EATEN BY MAYBE
Line_25	THE RABBIT WELL THEY BOTH KIND OF EAT LIKE PLANTS AND THEY BOTH GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_26	THEY ARE BOTH ANIMALS RIGHT
Line_27	THEY EAT MEAT
Line_28	MEAT AND LIKE VEGETABLES
Line_29	THIS FOX IS PROBABLY A CARNIVORE
Line_30	THE MOOSE IS A VEGETARIAN
Line_31	A WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_32	CAN YOU PLEASE NAME ALL FOUR
Line_33	RED WORMS EAT DECAYING MATTER
Line_34	THEY ARE CHOMPING DOWN THE PAPER AND LEAVES AND TURNING IT INTO DIRT THAT MEANS THEY ARE DECOMPOSING
Line_35	IT TURNS INTO DIRT OR SOIL
Line_36	THE WASTE IS THE WORM'S FOOD
Line_37	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE GROWTH OF PLANTS
Line_38	SOMETHING WITH GROWTH
Line_39	IT IS MAKING THE YEAST ACTIVE
Line_40	BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO A LIVING THING
Line_41	SOMETHING THAT IS LIVING
Line_42	THAT YEAST ALSO IS A LIVING THING AND THAT IT WORKS JUST LIKE A HUMAN
Line_43	NO
Line_44	WATER SUNLIGHT AND DIRT OR SOIL
Line_45	YES IT DOES
Line_46	AND IT'S GROWN GROWING IT LOOKS CONSTIPATED
Line_47	IT'S SHOWING A APPLE
Line_48	YES
Line_49	I SEE A HOUSE WITH A GARDEN
Line_50	YES ALMOST YOU CAN A MILLION
Line_51	YES THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GET IT'S FOOD IT COULD PROBABLY MAY DIE
Line_52	A HOUSE
Line_53	IT NEEDS A SAFE PLACE TO REST
Line_54	NO BECAUSE PLANTS ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WILL NOT HAVE SHELTER BUT THEY MOSTLY DO NEED IT
Line_55	PLEASE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_56	BY THEIR BLOOD CELLS AND THEIR LEAVES
Line_57	THE FOOD THEY WELL THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN AND THE ENERGY
Line_58	IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY OF THIS STUFF WELL THEN IT GUARANTEED GONNA DIE
Line_59	PRODUCING THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_60	IS DYING IT'S
Line_61	IT'S NOT GETTING THE RIGHT MATERIALS THAT IT NEEDS TO LIVE
Line_62	IT MEANS IT'S GETTING NO FOOD AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY FOOD IT'S NOT GONNA LIVE
Line_63	IT'S DYING EVEN MORE AND IT LOOKS ALL CRUSTY
Line_64	IT'S ALSO NOT GETTING WIND LIKE IT ALSO NEEDS
Line_65	THAT'S NOT ONE OF THEM IT'S A MATERIAL THAT IT NEEDS AND IF IT DOESN'T GET THAT IT'S NOT GONNA PROCEED AND LIVE IT'S LIFE
Line_66	IT DOESN'T NEED AS MUCH AS IT NEEDS WITH WATER
Line_67	IT DIDN'T HAVE WIND OR SUN
Line_68	THEN THAT MEANS IT'S GETTING ALL THE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS
Line_69	THAT FOOD WEBS ARE IMPORTANT TO LIFE
Line_70	THAT PLANTS ARE
Line_71	IT STARTS WITH THE DECOMPOSERS THEN TO THE PRODUCERS THEN TO THE CONSUMERS
Line_72	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FOOD WEBS PLANTS LIVING THINGS AND HOW PLANTS NEED AIR SUN AND WATER
Line_73	THAT IS YEAST
Line_74	WAIT A SECOND IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GOING INTO
Line_75	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_76	THESE MIGHT BE A LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_77	PINK LIKE PINK STRIPS WITH PURPLE SPOTS IN IT
Line_78	THEY ARE PINK AND THEY
Line_79	THEY THEY ARE MUSCLES MUSCLES THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE STRIPS OF PIECES OF TAFFY
Line_80	THESE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_81	THAT THE PURPLE THINGS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_82	THAT THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN
Line_83	THESE ARE SKIN CELLS
Line_84	THEY ARE THIN TINY CELLS IN A SKIN IN SKIN
Line_85	SKIN CELLS ALMOST
Line_86	CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF UNIQUE
Line_87	THEY ARE BOTH
Line_88	THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT BLOOD CELLS
Line_89	BLOOD CELLS
Line_90	THAT THEY'RE JUST LIKE THAT THEY'RE JUST LIKE ANIMALS
Line_91	THEY ARE ALL LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_92	PLANTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE CELLS
Line_93	A BUTTERFLY IS LIVING
Line_94	YOU KNOW I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY HATE YOU RIGHT NOW
Line_95	THE ESOPHAGUS
Line_96	EATING
Line_97	IT BREAKS IT DOWN
Line_98	IT CHEWS UP FOOD
Line_99	IT HOLDS SALIVA
Line_100	IT IS LIKE A LITTLE TUBE WHERE THE CHEWED UP FOOD GOES AND LEAVES INTO THE STOMACH
Line_101	IT IS LIKE A TUBE
Line_102	THAT THEY ARE LIKE THE LAST STAGE OF
Line_103	THERE'S LARGE INTESTINES AND A SMALL INTESTINE
Line_104	WE WENT OVER THE HUMAN BODY WE WENT OVER BLOOD CELLS WE WENT OVER THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_105	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_106	LEAF THIS IS A LEAF WITH A BUNCH OF VEINS YOU CAN SEE
Line_107	LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES THE BUT I FORGOT THEIR
Line_108	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF VEINS
Line_109	A PALMATE
Line_110	IT IS PALMATE NO I FORGOT
Line_111	I FORGOT
Line_112	IT IS
Line_113	TO HELP TRAVEL THE SAP AND THE NUTRIENTS AND CELLS
Line_114	THIS IS SHOWING XYLEM AND PHLOEM
Line_115	I DON'T KNOW
Line_116	WELL YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
Line_117	FROM THE OXYGEN
Line_118	THAT PLANTS DON'T GET THEIR WATER
Line_119	ANIMALS
Line_120	THAT THEY ALL ARE DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE THEY WANT TO DO WITH US
Line_121	HOW THEY BLEND IN OR SHOW IN THE IN THEIR HABITAT
Line_122	THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS AND STRIPES AND TURNS ON THEM
Line_123	HOW IT HOW IT SHOWS IN THE PATTERNS ON IT
Line_124	PEOPLE HAVE NOSES
Line_125	YES
Line_126	HOW IT CAN BLEND HOW IT CAN BLEND IN
Line_127	BY THE PATTERNS ON IT
Line_128	NUMBER TWO
Line_129	THE TWO AND IT'S THE TEETH
Line_130	IT'S THE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE WINGS AND ITS BRIGHT COLORS
Line_131	PREDATORS AND PREY
Line_132	THE THE PERSON IS SCARED BECAUSE THE SNAKE EATS COULD EAT HER THE GIRL
Line_133	THE USES THE RATTLE ON THE TAIL
Line_134	ANIMALS AND ADAPTATION
Line_135	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_136	MY BODY AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE SUITCASE MAIN ONE BECAUSE THE SUITCASE HAD A TON OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MADE UP THE SUITCASE
Line_137	I THINK THERE'S VERY MANY PARTS OF THE ENGINE THAT'S MOVING AND MAKING THE ENTIRE CAR WORK
Line_138	I THINK IT'S LIKE A SUBSYSTEM AND UM A SUBSYSTEM IS A LITTLE SYSTEM THAT MAKES UP A BIG SYSTEM
Line_139	I THINK IT'S A SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE'S TONS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MOVE AND STOP
Line_140	IT SHOWS UM HOW THAT ONE THING HELPS YOUR BODY
Line_141	I THINK IT'S UM THE VEINS OR THE BLOOD GOES THROUGH TO ALL PARTS OF YOUR BODY
Line_142	IT TELLS ME IT'S A SYSTEM
Line_143	ALL OF THE SUBSYSTEMS IT HAS
Line_144	THE BIOSPHERE IS ALL ABOUT LIFE
Line_145	I THINK IT'S MADE OF A TON OF LIFE
Line_146	WHAT TYPE OF PLACE THAT PLACE IS
Line_147	THE TUNDRA WETLANDS AND THE FORESTS
Line_148	UM IT MEANS WHAT EATS WHAT AND UH WHAT DOESN'T ANYTHING AND STUFF
Line_149	KAY BYE HEY WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_150	WAKING THE YEAST UP
Line_151	BECAUSE THEY'RE A LIVING THING AND ALL LIVING THINGS NEED TO HAVE WATER AND FOOD
Line_152	WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE A LIVING THING AND IF THEY'RE A LIVING THING THEY EAT AND STUFF BUT THEY'RE DORMANT
Line_153	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE YEAST IS A LIVING THING
Line_154	MAYBE IT'S THE YEAST IS FINALLY WAKING UP
Line_155	DIRT WATER AND THE SUNLIGHT
Line_156	NUTRIENTS FROM THE SOIL
Line_157	I THINK PLANTS NEED THE SUN
Line_158	NO I DON'T THINK IT REALLY WOULD
Line_159	PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FEED THEM
Line_160	I THINK THAT'S TOMATO JUICE
Line_161	I DON'T THINK THEY NEED IT BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_162	YES THEY DO NEED THAT
Line_163	THE SUN MAKES IT LOOK GREEN AND IF IT DOESN'T GET NAY SUN THEN IT WON'T BE GREEN
Line_164	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH AIR SO IT'S GONNA SHRIVEL UP AND DIE
Line_165	IT HAS ALL THE STUFF IT NEEDS TO GROW
Line_166	IT'S NICE AND HEALTHY AND IT'S FREE TO GROW
Line_167	IT'S WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_168	PRODUCERS ARE USUALLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD WEB WHICH MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT EATS IT
Line_169	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE VASCULAR SYSTEM AND PLANTS AND VASCULAR MEANS VEINS
Line_170	SOME LEAVES ARE ON DIFFERENT PLANTS AND SOME AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THEIR VEINS TO BE GOING
Line_171	PINNATE PALMATE AND PARALLEL
Line_172	WELL WE HAVE VEINS OR ANIMALS
Line_173	THE VASCULAR SYSTEM IT IT CARRIES ALL THE FOOD AND NUTRIENTS
Line_174	I THINK IT COMES FROM THE LEAF BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES
Line_175	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_176	IT WARNS ANIMALS TO STAY AWAY OR THEY CAN BE SPRAYED
Line_177	THE COYOTE DOESN'T WANT TO GO ANYWAY NEAR THE SKUNK BECAUSE IT'S TAIL IS UP AND THAT MEANS IT MIGHT SPRAY IT
Line_178	WHEN IT LIFTS ITS TAIL IT CAN SPRAY PEOPLE AND THAT MAKES THEM STINK FOR DAYS
Line_179	HE GETS OUT OF THERE BEFORE HE STINKS TOO
Line_180	SOMETHINGS ARE THINGS YOU DID DID BY DONE BY HUMANS AND THE OTHER TWO THINGS ARE FROM
Line_181	TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT SO THAT YOU HIT IT YOU HIT THE KNEE IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT IN THE EXACT SPOT THE PERSON'S FOOT WILL GO UP
Line_182	MAY TOUCH TO THE HOT STOVE AND THAT BURNT THEM SO THEY PULLED THEIR HAND AWAY REALLY FAST BECAUSE IT REALLY REALLY HURTS
Line_183	THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_184	A CAT IS FALLING OUT OF A TREE
Line_185	IT HAS MANY SUBSYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS IN IT
Line_186	IT COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF A SYSTEM AND IT RELATES TO MY SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_187	ALL OF IT'S SUBSYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS
Line_188	SYSTEM IT'S A SYSTEM
Line_189	IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND MAYBE HARD TO UNDERSTAND
Line_190	THEY ALL COVER ALMOST ALL OF THE BODY AND THAT PROBABLY MEANS THEY ALL HELP THE BODY IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_191	THESE WORDS ARE A LITTLE HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND COULD YOU PLEASE TALK IN A LESS COMPLICATED WAY
Line_192	DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
Line_193	OH MY GOSH
Line_194	UM I SEE A MOUNTAIN I SEE HOMES I SEE TREES I SEE CORAL AND I SEE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROCKS
Line_195	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
Line_196	THE BIOSPHERE IS ALL OF LIFE THE BIOSPHERE IS ALL OF LIFE
Line_197	I SEE A FOREST INCLUDING BEAR MOOSE WATER AND SNOW
Line_198	THEY'RE PART OF LIFE AND SO THEY'RE KIND THEY'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE COLORS ON THIS GRID
Line_199	GREEN
Line_200	COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION
Line_201	THEY'RE BRIGHTENING UP JUST LIKE THE LITTLE THING IN THE IS
Line_202	IT BECOMES PINK
Line_203	A FOOD WEB IS UM A BUNCH OF ANIMALS ECOSYSTEMS LIKE IF ONE ANIMAL EATS ANOTHER
Line_204	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ANIMALS WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY HUNT
Line_205	THEY'RE ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS
Line_206	THIS IS BORING ME TO DEATH
Line_207	I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU TODAY DID YOU ENJOY TALKING WITH ME
Line_208	LIVING SYSTEMS HOW BOUT YOU
Line_209	THEY'RE ALL LIVING SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE ALL PART OF A DIFFERENT SYSTEM
Line_210	SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEM
Line_211	THEY'RE THEY ARE MANY ECOSYSTEMS AND FOOD WEBS MANY ECOSYSTEMS AND FOOD WEBS
Line_212	A PRODUCER LIKE DOESN'T EAT STUFF BUT IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD BY THE SUN
Line_213	IT USES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO MAKE IT'S FOOD
Line_214	THEY PRODUCE THEMSELVES BY NOT EATING OTHER THINGS
Line_215	BY EATING OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS
Line_216	THAT'S WHAT A CONSUMER BASICALLY IS
Line_217	EATING THE DEAD STUFF
Line_218	SO THAT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH DEAD STUFF THAT COVERS THE GROUND
Line_219	IT'S A FOOD WEB
Line_220	NO COMPRENDO SENORITA
Line_221	I FARTED
Line_222	YOU FART
Line_223	GRASSES AND PLANTS
Line_224	BECAUSE HERBIVORES ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_225	YOU EAT ONLY MEAT
Line_226	MEAT YOU EAT MEAT AND PLANTS AND BERRIES SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR PICTURE
Line_227	TO EAT LIKE DIRT
Line_228	DIRT DIRT
Line_229	THEY EAT DEAD STUFF
Line_230	ONE THAT ONLY EATS MEAT
Line_231	IT'S A DECOMPOSER
Line_232	IT IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_233	DECOMPOSER
Line_234	THEY BREAK DOWN DECAYING AND DECAYED STUFF
Line_235	UM THERE USED TO BE LESS DIRT AND PLANTS AND STUFF BUT NOW THERE'S MORE DIRT THAN PLANTS
Line_236	IT BECOMES DIRT IT BECOMES DIRT
Line_237	BECAUSE IF THERE IS MORE DEAD STUFF THAN THERE IS DIRT THE WORLD WOULD BE AN UNHEALTHY PLACE
Line_238	PLEASE HELP ME I'M A POOR OLD MAN
Line_239	YOU HAVE A NICE DAY OKAY
Line_240	GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_241	LIVING SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY AN ANIMAL
Line_242	IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_243	WHAT IS THIS
Line_244	GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_245	YEAST AND PLANTS
Line_246	YEAST IS LIVING AND THE FOOD PLUS THE WATER MAKES IT PUFF UP THE BAG
Line_247	THE YEAST WANTS TO EAT SO IT EATS THE GRAHAM CRACKER AND DRINKS UP THE WATER AND MAKES AIR
Line_248	SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE OR BREAK THEY'RE DORMANCY
Line_249	COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT YOURSELF I DIDN'T CATCH THAT
Line_250	THEY'RE ASLEEP MOST OF THE TIME AND THEY LIKE TO EAT
Line_251	IT LOOKS KIND OF BROWNIE AND MIXED
Line_252	IT MAKES UP THE YEAST
Line_253	ONE OF ONE OF THE PLANTS IS HEALTHY AND GROWING AND ONE IS UNHEALTHY AND DYING
Line_254	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS ALIVE AND ONE OF THEM IS DEAD
Line_255	ONE HAS THE SUN WATER AND FOOD IT NEEDS AND THE OTHER DOESN'T
Line_256	I'M GROWING THEM
Line_257	A SHINY DAY WHERE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
Line_258	WATER SUN AND A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE BABY
Line_259	I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING THAT A PLANT MIGHT NEED COULD YOU HELP ME OUT A LITTLE
Line_260	YEAH THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE SO THAT THEY CAN DO PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH MAKES THEM ALIVE
Line_261	PLANTS NEED SUN AND WIND BUT NOT A CHEESEBURGER
Line_262	YES THEY NEED AIR TO SURVIVE OR ELSE THEY'LL DIE
Line_263	IT'S PLANT HELPER AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT DOES THOUGH
Line_264	YES
Line_265	YES
Line_266	PLANT NEED FEED TO SURVIVE
Line_267	YES BECAUSE IF IF
Line_268	HOUSE
Line_269	NO THEY DO NOT NEED IT
Line_270	BYE BYE
Line_271	GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_272	LIVING ORGANISMS
Line_273	COULD YOU PLEASE HELP OUT HERE I DON'T KNOW
Line_274	BECAUSE I AM LEARNING ABOUT LIVING CELLS AND ANIMALS
Line_275	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BACTERIA INSIDE OF SKIN OR SOMETHING
Line_276	NOTHING PUDDING
Line_277	I DON'T SEE HOW TO GET THE INFORMATION COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_278	IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF SPIKY BALLS
Line_279	THAT THEY'RE BRAIN CELLS
Line_280	BRAIN CELLS ARE WHAT HELP YOU THINK
Line_281	THEY'RE SKIN CELLS
Line_282	THEY'RE IN YOUR BODY
Line_283	THEY ARE IN YOUR BODY
Line_284	SKIN CELLS
Line_285	FUR FUR AND FLESHY STUFF
Line_286	THEY'RE MADE OF THE SAME KIND OF CELLS
Line_287	THEY'RE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CELLS
Line_288	SOME ARE ROUND AND OVAL AND SOME ARE ROUND AND SQUARE AND SILVER
Line_289	I SEE
Line_290	HUMANS GOT LOT AND LOTS OF CELLS
Line_291	A HUMAN BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST
Line_292	BUTTERFLIES HAVE CELLS
Line_293	THEY BOTH LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE SIMILAR PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_294	I DON'T KNOW I NEED HELP THERE
Line_295	A HUMAN'S LIKE KIND OF DIGESTIVE AND STOMACH AND ALL THAT STUFF
Line_296	THEY BREAK DOWN FOOD AND DISPOSE OF IT
Line_297	IT CHEWS YOUR FOOD UP
Line_298	IT MAKES AND FORMS SPIT
Line_299	NOTHING
Line_300	GOOD HOW BOUT YOU
Line_301	IT'S A LEAF WITH XYLEM AND PHLOEM VEINS
Line_302	ASPEN LEAVES
Line_303	THEY'RE ALL LEAVE
Line_304	THEY'RE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEINS THAT DO DIFFERENT THINGS FOR US
Line_305	DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREES NEED DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
Line_306	ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEAVES MAN
Line_307	BOOGER
Line_308	BOOGER
Line_309	BOOGER
Line_310	BOOGER
Line_311	BOOGER MOTHER
Line_312	CHEESEBURGER
Line_313	IT'S ABOUT THE XYLEM
Line_314	THEY ARE THOSE VEINS WE SEE IN LEAVES
Line_315	THEY'RE THE VEINS THAT ARE IN A
Line_316	IT TELLS THE REST OF THE PLANT WHERE THE WATER AND SUGAR AND ALL THAT SHOULD GO
Line_317	ALL THE NUTRIENTS AND STUFF IS BEING TRANSPORTED TO DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_318	IT'S THE AIR AND WATER MOLECULES ON THE PLANTS
Line_319	BYE HAVE A NICE DAY
Line_320	GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_321	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_322	THEY'RE ALL LIVING SYSTEMS OR IN YOUR LANGUAGE ONLY LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_323	I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_324	THEY ALL HAVE
Line_325	IT IS AN ADAPTATION
Line_326	BECAUSE IT CAN SCARE AWAY PREDATORS AND ENEMIES
Line_327	ITS SHELL CAN BE USED TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM PREDATORS
Line_328	THE FEET
Line_329	BECAUSE THEY'RE WEBBED AND IT'S INSTINCT FOR THE DUCK
Line_330	NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH BECAUSE THEY'RE SHARP AND CAN BE USED TO BITE THROUGH THICK AND TOUGH MEAT
Line_331	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A MONARCH AND MONARCHS ARE POISONOUS AND MOST MONARCH PREDATORS LEARNED THEIR LESSON NOT TO EAT THOSE
Line_332	THE RATTLESNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL TO STAY AWAY
Line_333	SNAKE GO BITE AND THEN YOU GO DEAD
Line_334	BAD SMELL
Line_335	WELL THERE'S LOTS OF UM PARTS THAT UM HELP IT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MOVE AND YEAH
Line_336	WELL THERE'S LIKE THE WHEELS THAT WORK TOGETHER AND THEN THERE'S DIFFERENT GEARS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT HELP THE CAR MOVE
Line_337	WELL ALL THE PARTS LIKE THE WHEELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND THEY ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE CAR TO WORK
Line_338	LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ALL WORK TOGETHER
Line_339	WELL THERE'S THE HEART
Line_340	I NOTICED THAT IT'S ALSO A SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER AND HELP EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE BODY MOVE AND STAY ALIVE
Line_341	WELL LOTS OF PARTS ON THE EARTH HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND UM MAKE IT THE EARTH THAT IT IS AND KEEP IT HEALTHY
Line_342	THERE ARE FOUR AND ALL OF THEM ARE BIOSPHERE ATMOSPHERE GEOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE
Line_343	IT'S IT HAS ANIMALS AND PEOPLE AND LOTS OF GRASS AND TREES
Line_344	WELL THERE'S LOTS OF LIKE FORESTS AND WATER WHERE ANIMALS CAN LIVE
Line_345	WELL THE BLUE REPRESENTS WATER AND THEN THE GREEN REPRESENTS FOREST AND THE PURPLE REPRESENTS MORE LIKE COLD PLACES
Line_346	WELL THERE'S ANIMALS BUT THERE'S NO PLANTS SO THERE'S JUST ANIMALS THAT ARE LIVING WHICH ARE BIOSPHERES
Line_347	WELL IT'S SHOWING LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THEM
Line_348	GOOD
Line_349	WELL THERE'S DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS AND UM
Line_350	DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS
Line_351	CONSUMERS DECOMPOSERS AND PRODUCERS
Line_352	IT MEANS THAT LIKE YOU PRODUCE THINGS LIKE UM TREES PRODUCE AIR
Line_353	I HAVE TO GET UM YOUR ENERGY FROM OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_354	THIS IS LIKE WHAT UM AN HERBIVORE AN OMNIVORE AND CARNIVORE AND A DETRIVORE IS
Line_355	LIKE PLANTS AND BERRIES AND FRUITS AND UM MEAT AND BACON AND
Line_356	IT MEANS LIKE THAT THEY EAT ALL LIKE THEY EAT EVERYTHING THEY'LL EAT ALL FOODS
Line_357	THE BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT
Line_358	THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS ALSO KNOWN AS DETRIVORES
Line_359	AN UM THE ORGANISM A RED WORM IS IS A DECOMPOSER ALSO KNOWN AS A DETRIVORE
Line_360	THEY'RE UM BREAKING DOWN THE NEWSPAPER AND LEAVES AND TURNING IT INTO SOIL
Line_361	AFTER UM A A COUPLE WEEKS IT WILL TURN INTO SOIL
Line_362	BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR FOOD AND IT ALSO CAN HELP US
Line_363	IT IS BECAUSE IF THERE'S LITTER OR PAPER LIKE NEWSPAPER ON THE GROUND THEY CAN BREAK IT DOWN AND TURN IT INTO SOIL SO THERE'S NO MORE LITTER
Line_364	ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_365	WELL WE DID A PROJECT JUST LIKE THIS WITH YEAST ANIMAL CRACKERS AND WATER
Line_366	IT'S ABOUT
Line_367	THEY WELL THE YEAST IS A LIVING THING AND
Line_368	THAT IT'S A LIVING SYSTEM AND IT NEEDS FOOD AND WATER TO GET ACTIVE
Line_369	THAT YEAST IS TINY AND THEY'RE THEY NEED TO MOVE AROUND
Line_370	THAT THEY'RE SLEEPING
Line_371	SUNLIGHT AND WATER
Line_372	WELL NOT ALL PLANTS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_373	WELL THAT IS WIND SOMETIMES A PLANT SOMETIMES NEEDS THAT BUT DOESN'T ALWAYS NEED THAT
Line_374	WELL A PLANT NEEDS AIR FOR OXYGEN
Line_375	YES BECAUSE PLANTS ARE A LIVING SYSTEM AND JUST LIKE US WE ARE A LIVING SYSTEM TOO AND WE ALSO NEED AIR TO BREATHE
Line_376	YES BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE JUST LIKE HUMANS AND HUMANS NEED AIR TO BREATHE
Line_377	THE PLANTS NEED TO THE SUN ALSO
Line_378	WELL NOT ALWAYS
Line_379	THEY ALSO NEED FOOD TO GROW
Line_380	NO BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS AIR AND WATER WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT AND THE SUN
Line_381	THEY DON'T NEED JUICE BECAUSE THEY SHOULD ALREADY HAVE WATER
Line_382	BECAUSE FOR BECAUSE FERTILIZER CAN PRODUCE WATER
Line_383	IT'S SHOWING THAT THERE'S AIR AND THE ROOTS AND THE FOOD AND THE SUN
Line_384	THEY THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD AND THEY GET IT FROM THE ENERGY THAT THEY GET FROM THE SUN AND THE WATER AND THE OXYGEN
Line_385	THIS IS LIKE A DEAD PLANT
Line_386	IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN
Line_387	WELL BECAUSE PLANTS NEED SUN TO LIVE
Line_388	THIS ONE IS DEAD AND BROWN
Line_389	AS IT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH AIR
Line_390	IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER
Line_391	THIS PLANT IS HEALTHY AND HAS ENOUGH WATER AIR AND SUN
Line_392	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS
Line_393	THAT IT'S HEALTHY AND IT HAS ALL THAT IT NEEDS TO LIVE
Line_394	WELL YOU NEED A PLANT AND A FOOD WEB
Line_395	WELL IF A BUNNY WERE TO EAT THE GRASS
Line_396	THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PRODUCER IN A FOOD WEB IN A FOOD IN A FOOD WEB FOR IT TO WORK OUT
Line_397	SOMETIMES IT STARTS FROM A PRODUCER
Line_398	GOOD
Line_399	WELL IT'S SHOWING LIKE LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_400	BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF CELLS IN OUR BODY
Line_401	I NOTICE THAT THERE'S LOTS OF CELLS IN THE THIGH
Line_402	THAT THEY HELP THEY HELP YOU CONTROL
Line_403	THAT THEY HAVE
Line_404	THERE'S LOTS OF CELLS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_405	THAT THERE'S LOTS OF BRAIN CELLS LIKE IN LOTS OF PLACES AND THE BRAIN CELLS ARE BIG AND THEY HELP YOU LIKE THINK
Line_406	THAT THEY'RE LOTS OF CELLS
Line_407	THAT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE CELLS THEN OUR BLOOD COULDN'T RUN VERY HEALTHY
Line_408	THAT THEY HELP CONTROL YOUR ARM AND KEEP YOUR SKIN HEALTHY
Line_409	LOTS OF MEAT AND BLOOD AND MUSCLE BUT ESPECIALLY SKIN ESPECIALLY CELLS
Line_410	THERE'S LIKE LUNGS AND THERE'S A HEART THERE'S LOTS
Line_411	THERE'S THERE'S SKIN CELLS BRAIN CELLS AND
Line_412	THAT ALMOST ANYTHING HAS CELLS
Line_413	THAT THEY LOOK LIKE CELLS
Line_414	THAT THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE
Line_415	THAT THEY THEY ALL HAVE CELLS AND SOME THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_416	I THINK THE HUMAN HAS THE MOST CELLS BECAUSE THE HUMAN IS BIGGER
Line_417	WELL THIS IS AN INSECT BUT IT CAN IT'S ALSO AN ANIMAL AND IT SHOULD IT ALSO HAS CELLS
Line_418	THIS KIND OF ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A HUMAN BODY
Line_419	THAT THEY'RE SALIVA HAS TO BREAK DOWN THE FOOD
Line_420	THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_421	TO MAKE SURE WE STAY HEALTHY AND DON'T GET ANYTHING BAD IN OUR BODY
Line_422	IT BREAKS IT DOWN SO WE DON'T CHOKE
Line_423	IT WILL TAKE OUT ALL THE BAD STUFF AND IT WILL BREAK THINGS DOWN
Line_424	THAT IT HAS A SALIVA WHICH CAN BREAK YOUR FOOD DOWN AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T CHOKE

Line_426	IT BRINGS YOUR FOOD DOWN
Line_427	THAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR FOOD GOES DOWN TO YOUR STOMACH
Line_428	IT HELPS YOU SWALLOW DOWN THE FOOD AND
Line_429	THAT'S WHERE ALL YOUR FOOD GOES
Line_430	THEY ALSO HELP YOU DIGEST YOUR FOOD
Line_431	ABOUT LIKE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES AND LIKE THE DIFFERENT NAMES AND ABOUT THE ROOTS IN THE LEAVES
Line_432	THAT THERE'S A PINNATE A PALMATE AND A PARALLEL
Line_433	ALL THE ROOTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY'RE SHAPE IS DIFFERENT
Line_434	THERE'S THREE KINDS OF VEINS THERE'S PALMATE PINNATE AND PARALLEL
Line_435	ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND UM HOW YOUR FOOD DIGESTS AND HOW YOU BREATHE
Line_436	YOUR ESOPHAGUS AND YOUR MOUTH
Line_437	THEY ALL HELP YOU LIKE DIGEST YOUR FOOD
Line_438	THE LUNGS NOSE MOUTH UM BRONCHI DIAPHRAGM
Line_439	BECAUSE IF YOU COULDN'T BREATHE YOU WOULDN'T BE ALIVE AND
Line_440	THAT THIS IS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH
Line_441	IT GETS THE BREATHING FOR IN HUMANS
Line_442	THEY HELP YOU LIKE PUMP AIR OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM AND THEN BACK IN
Line_443	THAT LIKE IT'S UM LIKE THE LUNG BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING YOU PUMP AIR AND PUMP IT OUT
Line_444	BRONCHI
Line_445	UM HELPING PUMP THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS AND OUT OF
Line_446	THEY IT GETS RID OF ALL OF THE BAD AIR
Line_447	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_448	ABOUT LIKE LIKE LUNGS AND HOW WE BREATHE
Line_449	IT WE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW ANIMALS LIKE USE TO ATTRACTIONS TO CALL MATES OR SENSE DANGER
Line_450	THAT THEY ALL CALL FOR MATES AND SENSE DANGER AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW AND THEY TRY AND GET AWAY FROM PREDATORS AND YEAH
Line_451	WELL THE SKUNK WOULD USE ITS SMELL CAUSE IT IT STINKS LIKE REALLY BAD IT WILL USE ITS SMELL TO MAKE PREDATORS GO AWAY
Line_452	IT IS LIKE ONE OF ITS ADAPTATIONS IS THAT IT BLENDS IN WITH THE SAND SO IF ONE OF ITS PREDATORS COME BY IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
Line_453	WELL IT LIKE COULD BLEND INTO THE CORAL
Line_454	THE THE FEET IS LITTLE TINY LITTLE CUTE LITTLE FEET
Line_455	BECAUSE AS LIKE THE RIGHT KIND OF WEB KIND OF IN LIKE IT IT'S REALLY LIKE HELPS IT PUSH
Line_456	NUMBER TWO DOES BECAUSE THEY'RE CANINE TEETH AND THEY'RE REALLY SHARP AND HELPS THEM LIKE CHEW IT UP
Line_457	I THINK THAT ITS WINGS DO SO IT COULD FLY AWAY
Line_458	BECAUSE LIKE THEY'RE SO BRIGHT AND THEY HAVE THEIR WINGS CAN HELP IT FLY AWAY FROM PREDATORS
Line_459	WELL SHE'S LIKE LIKE THE SNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL WITH HIS RATTLE
Line_460	SO THE HUMAN DOESN'T GET HURT HE'S JUST GIVING HER A SIMPLE WARNING
Line_461	WELL THE SNAKE IS THE STIMULUS AND THE GIRL IS THE REACTION
Line_462	WELL THE THE SKUNK IS LIKE MAKING HIS SMELL SO THAT THE COYOTE WILL GO AWAY
Line_463	THE HIS SMELL IS LIKE SKUNK SMELL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY
Line_464	IT COULD HAVE A REALLY WEIRD REACTION
Line_465	IT'S ABOUT STIMULUS IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ACTUALLY LIKE REACTIONS AND STUFF
Line_466	THAT THEY'LL SHOW A STIMULUS AND AND A REACTION I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_467	THEY'RE LIKE MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET COLD ON WHERE THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY ARE
Line_468	INSTINCTUAL BEHAVIOR
Line_469	WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE SAYING LIKE GO AWAY I JUST GOT THAT ON SPEAKER OH MY GOSH
Line_470	NO IT ISN'T A LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A REACTION
Line_471	YES YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE BECAUSE IT'S NOT INSTINCTIVE IT'S A LEARNING THING
Line_472	WE'VE BEEN DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
Line_473	SALAD IS MIXED WITH VEGETABLES
Line_474	THEY ARE MIXED WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_475	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT
Line_476	IT TASTES BETTER WHEN IT'S MIXED
Line_477	THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_478	THE MARBLES ARE STUCK IN THE THINGY AND THE WATER WENT IN THE BOWL
Line_479	FOR THE SCREEN THE SAND FALLS ON THE SCREEN SO THEN THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
Line_480	THE SAND IS NOT GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_481	IT I KIND OF FORGOT I'M SORRY
Line_482	THE SALT EVAPORATES OR DISSOLVES
Line_483	MAYBE I I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_484	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT EVAPORATES THE WATER STILL STAYS AS SALT WATER
Line_485	IS TURNING INTO A MIXTURE BUT SALT DISSOLVES AND IF IT WAS HAD SAND IN IT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO THE WATER IN THE SCREEN
Line_486	SALT OR THE SOLUTION
Line_487	YES YOU COULD PUT THE GRAPE JUICE BACK IN THE CAN BUT THE WATER WOULD JUST THE GRAPE JUICE WOULD BE PURIFIED WITH WATER
Line_488	AH
Line_489	THERE IS MUD MADE FROM SAND AND WATER
Line_490	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID RIGHT NOW IT'S SOME KIND OF
Line_491	IT DISSOLVES
Line_492	I LIKE TACOS
Line_493	WHAT IS THE SOLUTE DON'T KNOW A SOLUTE IS SO PLEASE TELL WHAT IS THE SOLUTE IS OKAY
Line_494	WHAT IS A SOLUTE
Line_495	WHAT IS THE SOLUTE
Line_496	SALT SALT SALT ANSWER ME
Line_497	I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU A REAL PERSON OR IT JUST LIKE AN ANIMATED ROBOT
Line_498	THE SOLUTION
Line_499	CAN YOU PLEASE ANSWER ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_500	REPEAT THAT
Line_501	IT IS PERFECTLY BALANCED
Line_502	WE HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT
Line_503	OF A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION SO PROBABLY
Line_504	WE HAVE NOT LEARNED WHAT SOLUTE MEANS YEAH SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT A SOLUTE MEANS YOU THINK DO CAN DO THAT FOR ME PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A SOLUTE IS
Line_505	IT MEANS IT WILL CREATE THE SOLUTION AT THE END BECAUSE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SALTS INTO THE CUP
Line_506	A SOLUTION
Line_507	A MIXTURE A MIXTURE THE MIXTURE
Line_508	IT'S A MIXTURE NOW BUT THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT DOESN'T CREATE A SOLUTION
Line_509	IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_510	A SOLUTION
Line_511	A MIXTURE
Line_512	I DON'T KNOW
Line_513	IT IS CREATING A MIXTURE
Line_514	THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
Line_515	IT IS WE TURN TO CRYSTALS LIKE SALT CRYSTALS I THINK SO WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_516	CREATE A MIXTURE
Line_517	THE PERSON WAS MIXING IT UP
Line_518	AH I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
Line_519	I'M I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TIME IT TAKES TIME FOR TO EVAPORATE
Line_520	TODAY WE TOOK THE SALT CRYSTALS MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_521	BYE
Line_522	MIXTURES
Line_523	SOLUTIONS
Line_524	USING A SCREEN AND OR A MAGNET OR A FUNNEL
Line_525	WHAT DID YOU SAY MARNEY
Line_526	WHAT DID YOU SAY MARNEY
Line_527	WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT THE MIXTURES MARNEY
Line_528	I THINK THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF THIS PICTURE IS MASS
Line_529	IS IT IS A MAGNET IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_530	CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION MARNEY
Line_531	LOOKS LIKE THE SAME EXAMPLE TO ME THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE
Line_532	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES ARE TYPES OF GASES SOME ARE SOLIDS AND SOME ARE LIQUIDS
Line_533	I THINK IT'S THE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THOSE HAVE METAL IN IT AND MAGNETS ATTRACT METAL
Line_534	MARNEY WHAT IS A WAIT WHAT WAS IT
Line_535	I THINK IT COULD BE SALT
Line_536	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_537	A SOLUTION
Line_538	BYE TALKING TALKING
Line_539	NOT GOOD NOT GOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_540	WAIT WHAT DO WE DO IN SCIENCE
Line_541	IS THAT MOULD OM THE RIGHT CUP I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ACTUALLY GROSS
Line_542	I'M JUST JUST SAYING IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A ROCK
Line_543	THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE AH I MEAN THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE GRAMS THAN THE FEATHER
Line_544	WHAT IS A SOLUTE
Line_545	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHS HEAVIER
Line_546	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT AH
Line_547	THE MOST CONCENTRATED SOLUTION TOO
Line_548	AH THE ONE LOOKS LIKE THE ONE ON
Line_549	THE MOST DILUTED LOOKS LIKE A SOLUTION THREE
Line_550	GOOD BYE WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN
Line_551	NOT GOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_552	I DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE TODAY'S MONDAY AND LAST TIME WE DID SCIENCE WAS EITHER FRIDAY OR THURSDAY SO I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_553	IT LOOKS LIKE A CORK FLOATING ON TOP OF THE WATER AND A PENNY THAT HAS SUNK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER
Line_554	THEY FLOAT AND SOME DON'T FLOAT
Line_555	TOTALLY DUDE TOTALLY DUDE
Line_556	SOLUTION B HAS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS IT UP LIKE SALT CAUSE SALT CAN KEEP THINGS UP
Line_557	YEAH I I AGREE
Line_558	IT IT
Line_559	IT BECOME FIFTY YEAH IT BECOMES A HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF
Line_560	OH THE BLUE ONE IS MORE DENSE SO IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE YELLOW LIQUID
Line_561	IS VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_562	IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS OF SALT
Line_563	OH THE BLUE ONE HAS THE MOST GRAMS AND THAT MAKES IT MORE DENSE
Line_564	CAUSE ONE IS MORE DENSE AND ONE IS LESS DENSE THE LESS DENSE ONE IS THE GREEN AND THE MORE DENSE ONE IS
Line_565	HI HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_566	IT'S ABOUT SALT AND WATER
Line_567	IT HMM YEAH BYE
Line_568	I NOTICED THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATE EVERY TIME
Line_569	SO IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATE NOW BECAUSE IT'S THREE SCOOPS OF
Line_570	IT IS SO THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE
Line_571	ITS MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIME
Line_572	I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
Line_573	YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER ME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ME AND I ALREADY ANSWERED THE QUESTION SO
Line_574	I I SAID MORE CONCENTRATE WITH IT
Line_575	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WOULD BE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS IN THE WATER
Line_576	AH THE ONE ON THE MIDDLE WOULD BE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_577	THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE MOST THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS INSIDE OF THE CHEMICALS
Line_578	I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ROLE OF THE
Line_579	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_580	THE ONE ON THE MIDDLE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_581	IT LOOKS LIKE SUBSTANCE
Line_582	SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_583	THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES AND DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES LIKE LIKE THAT YOU CAN DESCRIBE THEM DIFFERENT
Line_584	UM THEY HAVE DIFFERENT
Line_585	THERE WOULD BE EPSOM SALT
Line_586	MUST BE EPSOM SALT IT MUST BE EPSOM SALT
Line_587	WE DID SCIENCE A COUPLE DAYS AGO SO I I FORGOT
Line_588	YOU'RE MAKING A CHEMICAL REACTION AND MAKING IT EXPLODE
Line_589	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_590	IT'S THE PRODUCT
Line_591	REPEAT
Line_592	I THINK THE BEST ONE WOULD BE THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING
Line_593	NUMBER TWO
Line_594	IT BECOMES THE PRODUCT
Line_595	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL IN IT
Line_596	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT
Line_597	THE MOLECULES ARE A DIFFERENT
Line_598	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_599	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_600	A PRODUCT OR A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_601	THEY'RE CHEMICAL CALLED BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_602	IT BUBBLES UP
Line_603	THE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_604	THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE DISSOLVES
Line_605	THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLECULES AND ALL
Line_606	IT JUST DISSOLVES
Line_607	IT DISSOLVES LIKE I KEEP SAYING
Line_608	I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME AFTER THE CHEMICALS ARE PUT IN SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN
Line_609	IT MADE BUBBLES
Line_610	I DON'T THINK THE CHEMICALS WILL HURT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WOULD BE WATER ON THE OUTSIDE
Line_611	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A NEW CHEMICAL
Line_612	LIKE SOMEONE IS DUMPING WATER INTO A GLASS
Line_613	IT
Line_614	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURING
Line_615	CAUSES RUST TO OCCUR
Line_616	IT THE TUBE WITH GREEN LIQUID MADE THE WATER TURN GREEN
Line_617	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE BENDING A GLOW STICK THAT'S ALL
Line_618	THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION TAKING PLACE
Line_619	YEAH TOTALLY
Line_620	I WANT TO SEE THAT VIDEO
Line_621	YOU'RE ADDING THE GRAPE STUFF GRAPETASTIC INTO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT BE A DIFFERENT CHEMICAL
Line_622	YES THERE IS I THINK
Line_623	TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS HOW THEY MIX TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_624	I'M DOING WELL TODAY VERY GOOD
Line_625	IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SAY IMPORTANT DO YOU MEAN IMPORTANT TO THE EARTH OR LIKE TO THE EXPERIMENT
Line_626	I NOTICED THAT IT BLEW UP SO I THINK IT MADE OXYGEN
Line_627	I FEEL THOSE CHEMICALS ARE CREATED CREATING OXYGEN OR HYDROGEN BUT POISONING
Line_628	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_629	IT LOOKS LIKE IT GETS HEAVIER WHEN YOU ADD MORE CHEMICALS TO IT
Line_630	PLUS BECAUSE AND GRAMS IS
Line_631	I THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_632	THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO EACH OTHER
Line_633	I JUST WANTED TO SAY I AGREED WITH YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I'M DOING GOOD
Line_635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_636	THEY ARE ALL TWO OR MORE THINGS THAT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_637	SOME ARE FOOD AND SOME ARE OTHER ITEMS
Line_638	HALF OF THEM ARE FOOD AND HALF OF THEM ARE OTHER MIXTURES
Line_639	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT ARE A BUNCH OF SEPARATE ITEMS
Line_640	IT IS A MIXTURE AND WHEN WE DO IT IT WILL MAKE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
Line_641	I WOULD CALL THESE MIXTURES
Line_642	IT GETS SORTED OUT INTO THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS AND THEN IT IS NOT A MIXTURE
Line_643	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED AND NOW ARE NOT A MIXTURE THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ITEMS
Line_644	THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED
Line_645	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND CREATED A SOLUTION
Line_646	I DON'T KNOW
Line_647	A SOLUTION
Line_648	MARNIE I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
Line_649	MARNIE I CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO
Line_650	NO MARNIE I DON'T KNOW THEM
Line_651	MARNIE I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
Line_652	A SOLUTE
Line_653	THAT NOTHING EVAPORATES OR DISAPPEARS
Line_654	THAT NOTHING DISAPPEARS OR EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR
Line_655	BY EVAPORATING THE LIQUID AND JUST LEAVING THE SOLID
Line_656	ONLY IN A MIXTURE NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_657	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER ALL THE WAY SO IT WAS ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
Line_658	THIS MEANS THAT THE WATER AND THE SALT ARE THE SOLUTE OR A SOLUTION
Line_659	THAT MEANS IT WAS A MIXTURE NOT A SOLUTION
Line_660	I NOTICED THAT THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER MEANING THAT IT WAS A SOLUTION
Line_661	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE LIQUID TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_662	IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE AND LEAVE THIS IT'LL BE
Line_663	GOOD BYE MARNIE
Line_664	I'M DOING EXCELLENT AND DONE GREAT SLEEP LAST NIGHT
Line_665	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_666	YOU CAN SORT IT WITH YOUR HAND
Line_667	YOU CAN USE A FUNNEL OR A SCREEN
Line_668	THERE IS A DRY MIXTURE AND A MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPERCLIPS OUT OF IT
Line_669	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE ROCKS AND THE WATER
Line_670	WHAT I SEE
Line_671	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND I THINK THE SAND
Line_672	THE MAGNET PULLED THE PAPERCLIPS OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_673	A SIEVE AND A MAGNET
Line_674	BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS AND THE WATER SO THE SIEVE CATCH THE ROCK ON TOP AND WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE HOLE
Line_675	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE METAL IN THEM AND SOME MIXTURES HAVE BIG OBJECTS AND SMALL OBJECTS IN THEM
Line_676	BECAUSE THE MAGNET WOULD GET THE PAPERCLIPS OUT AND LEAVE THE REST IN THERE
Line_677	I NOTICED THAT ONLY THE ROCKS WEREN'T THROUGH THE SIEVE NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SMALL
Line_678	I USED FILTER BECAUSE ITS HOLES ARE BIG ENOUGH THAT WATER CAN GO THROUGH BUT SMALL ENOUGH THAT SAND CANNOT
Line_679	BYE MARNIE SEE YOU WHENEVER I SEE YOU ALSO IF LIKE THE NEXT TIME WE DO ANY SCIENCE EXPERIMENT TOGETHER
Line_680	A OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_681	I THINK IT'S CALLED SOMETHING LIKE A OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_682	CAUSE IT'LL EITHER BE DARKER OR LIGHTER
Line_683	ONE ONLY HAS TWO PURPLE CRYSTAL SHARDS AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTAL SHARDS
Line_684	ONE OF THEM HAS TWO CRYSTALS OF POWDER AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTALS OF POWDER
Line_685	I THINK THIS IS TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE MORE DILUTE THE LIGHTER AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED THE DARKER
Line_686	CAUSE THERE IS MORE GRAPE DRINK POWDER IN THE DARKER ONE AND LESS GRAPE DRINK POWDER IN THE LIGHTER
Line_687	WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY ADDING WATER TO IT
Line_688	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER OR NOT PUT AS MUCH WATER IN TO START
Line_689	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER
Line_690	YOU CAN WEIGH EACH OF THEM IF YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AND SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE AND THAT ONE IS MUST CONCENTRATED
Line_691	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE THAN TWO AND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE TWO WEIGHT MORE THAN ONE
Line_692	HAI MARNIE SEE YOU NEXT TIME WE DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
Line_693	IT WILL FLOAT
Line_694	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOAT BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AWESOME
Line_695	THE ONE THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOAT AND THE ONE THAT IS MORE DENSE WILL SINK
Line_696	THE ONE THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED WILL SINK AND THE ONE THAT IS LESS CONCENTRATED WILL FLOAT
Line_697	IT WILL FLOAT INSTEAD OF
Line_698	WE
Line_699	BECAUSE THE DENSER ONE KEPT THE WEIGHTIER ONE WAY DOWN AND ENDED UP MIXING WITH IT
Line_700	BECAUSE THESE SOLUTIONS ARE FLOATING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_701	HI MARNIE I CAN WAIT TO DO MY NEXT EXPERIMENT WITH YOU
Line_702	I'M GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT IS A SATURATED SOLUTION
Line_704	WELL IT SOMETHING THAT CAN DISSOLVE IN WATER OF COURSE WATER AND SOMETHING TO PUT THIS SOLID INTO THE WATER WITH
Line_705	WE PUTTING SEVERAL SCOOPS OF SALT UNTIL THE COULDN'T HOLD ANYMORE SALT IN IT SO IT'S SATURATED
Line_706	DUE SO MUCH SALT IN THE WATER THAT THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE
Line_707	AFTER THREE SCOOPS IT'S IT'D BE THE WATER BECAME SATURATED AND THE EPSOM SALT WENT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_708	IT'S TAKING A LOT LONGER TO BECOME SATURATED
Line_709	IT MUCH THE REST IT SENT TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE SUGAR IS ADDING OR YOU TO ADD
Line_710	THE SUGAR TOOK LONGER TO BE SATURATE THE WATER THAN THE CITRIC ACID
Line_711	THE WATER IS RISING AS WE PUT IN MORE SALT
Line_712	I DON'T KNOW
Line_713	I'M DOING GOOD READY FOR SCIENCE WHAT ABOUT YOU
Line_714	WHEN YOU MIX TO THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT'S STARTED FIZZING UP
Line_715	WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME MORE ONE OF THE MORE THAN ONE OF THESE WITH WATER
Line_716	REACTANTS AND PRODUCTS
Line_717	VINEGAR OR WATER
Line_718	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT SO THEY CHEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_719	THE REACTANTS MOLECULES WHEN MIXED CHEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_720	BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER
Line_721	THERE ARE TWO PURPLE MOLECULES AND A LOT OF STILL BOTTOM MOLECULES
Line_722	NO BECAUSE THEY HAVE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND BASICALLY CREATED ONE NEW SUBSTANCE
Line_723	THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FIZZING UP
Line_724	THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE CUP NEEDED WATER STARTING FIZZING UP WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO THE CUP
Line_725	THE GREEN SUBSTANCE LET INTO THE WATER AND TURNED ALL THE WATER GREEN
Line_726	I MEAN THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS GREEN BECAUSE THE WATER WAS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE GREEN SUBSTANCE
Line_727	THE SUBSTANCE ON THE THE GLOW STICK STARTS TO GLOW
Line_728	THE WATER CHEMICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THE GRAPETASTIC IS MIXED WITH IT
Line_729	NO BECAUSE THE GRAPETASTIC IS JUST GOING INTO THE WATER AND NOT WHERE THE CHEMICAL IS CHANGING
Line_730	BYE SEE YOU LATER WHEN I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MORE SCIENCE
Line_731	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_732	I SEE CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER FOR THE REACTANTS TO CREATE A NEW SUBSTANCE
Line_733	I SAW A NEW PRODUCT AT THE BOTTOM
Line_734	THEY MADE IT FIZZ UP AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
Line_735	THAT IT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL CHANGE
Line_736	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOST
Line_737	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOST
Line_738	THE BAG THAT WAS OPEN LET OUT THE GAS THAT WAS CREATED AND THE BAG THAT WAS CLOSED KEPT THE GAS IN AND MAKING IT WAY MORE
Line_739	THE OPEN BAG IS LOWER OR IS WEIGHS LESS THAN THE CLOSED BAG
Line_740	BECAUSE THE OPEN BAG LEFT OUT OR LET THE GAS GO OUT AND THE CLOSED BAG DIDN'T
Line_741	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_742	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_743	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THEM
Line_744	THE HAS THE SALAD
Line_745	IT HAS EVERYTHING IN IT THAT MAKES IT A MIXTURE
Line_746	IT IS CALLED A MIXTURE WHEN ONE OR MORE I MEAN TWO OR MORE THINGS ARE COMPARED TO
Line_747	A MIXTURE
Line_748	IT IS NOT COMPARED AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IT IS CALLED
Line_749	THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR
Line_750	THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR MIXTURE AND NOT KEPT TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_751	THEY WERE AND NOT KEPT TOGETHER
Line_752	WHEN TRYING TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE SCREEN THEY WERE NOT PUT IN BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BIG
Line_753	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THEM FROM THE WATER
Line_754	SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE SAND AND WATER
Line_755	THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER INTO A MIXTURE AND THEN SEPARATE
Line_756	IT BECAME A MIXTURE AND THEN WAS SEPARATED
Line_757	WHEN IT DISSOLVES IT BECOMES PART OF THE OTHER MIXTURE AND CREATES ONE BIG SOLID
Line_758	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_759	MORE RULES THAT THEY HAVE IN CREATING THE SOLUTION IS WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE DISSOLVED
Line_760	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_761	THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WAS DISSOLVED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THE SALT AND WAS BY THE WATER AND DISSOLVED
Line_762	A
Line_763	NO I DO NOT THINK SO BECAUSE AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND DISSOLVES
Line_764	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SALT AND WATER BEING MIXTURES AND DISSOLVE
Line_765	THAT WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER TOGETHER IT JUST MAKES BROWN MUDDY WATER AND WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER IT MAKES A CLEAR SOLID AND LIQUID
Line_766	WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SALT IS THAT WHEN THE SAND AND WATER WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE IT WAS DISSOLVED
Line_767	I THINK THAT THE WATER IN THIS SOLUTION IS PLAYING THE LIQUID BECAUSE THE GRAPETASTIC IS A SOLID
Line_768	I THINK THAT IT IS CALLED A
Line_769	I THINK THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT IN THIS PICTURE AND ITS POSITION IS THE SOLID IN THIS PICTURE
Line_770	WE CALL THE THING THAT DOES THE DISSOLVING THE SOLVENT
Line_771	THE MASS OF THE STUFF GOING IN
Line_772	THE MASS IS CREATING A LARGER AMOUNT BECAUSE OF MORE MIXTURES BEING BROUGHT INTO
Line_773	MARNEY THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
Line_774	WHAT IS THE TERM MARNEY
Line_775	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_776	WHAT'S UP WITH THIS REPEAT
Line_777	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND IT BECAME A MIXTURE SOLUTION
Line_778	WHAT IS THIS OBJECT MARNEY
Line_779	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_780	WELL MARNEY THE WATER IS DISAPPEARING FROM EACH DISH BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING THE SALT IS SHRINKING INTO THE WATER
Line_781	MARNEY WHAT IS DISSIPATING MEAN
Line_782	MARNEY CAN YOU ZOOM IN ON THE PICTURE PLEASE
Line_783	MARNEY CAN WE GO OVER THIS WHOLE TEST AGAIN
Line_784	YOU TOO MARNEY HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
Line_785	ONE WAY WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE IS USING A SCREEN ANOTHER IS TAKING A FUNNEL
Line_786	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING OF ONE TWO OR MORE OBJECTS SHOULD MIX TOGETHER MAKING A COMBINATION
Line_787	THE OBJECT AND WATER IS BEING SEPARATED FROM WITH FROM THE SCREEN
Line_788	MARNIE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS
Line_789	MARNIE WHAT IS THE
Line_790	LEARNED ABOUT USING A MAGNET IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAGNET USES MAGNETISM TO GET THE MAGNETS UP
Line_791	MARNIE I CAN'T SEE YOUR PICTURE
Line_792	MARNIE I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
Line_793	WHAT IS THE SIEVE
Line_794	BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM WHEN IT BE STRONG
Line_795	I THINK WE USE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND DIFFERENT MIXTURES IT IT HELPS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS
Line_796	I THINK WE USED A MAGNET BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SEPARATE
Line_797	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL SEPARATED FROM THE SAND BECAUSE IT IS A BIGGER OBJECT AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_798	I THINK WE USED FILTER SO THAT THE WATER TO GO THROUGH AND THE SAND DID NOT
Line_799	IT'S YOU
Line_800	I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING MIXTURE AND SOLUTIONS THAT WERE ON AND SEPARATING THEM THROUGH THE MIXTURE
Line_801	MY BEST FRIEND BYE MARNIE MARNIE CAN YOU KEEP TALK TO ME
Line_802	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DILUTED CONCENTRATE LIQUIDS THAT HAVE AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_803	WELL TAKE A SOLUTION AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MIXTURE AND THEN SOMEHOW SEPARATE THE MIXTURE
Line_804	THE ONE THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_805	THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_806	BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER AS THE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_807	IT WOULD TASTE NOT AS STRONG AND A LITTLE BIT MORE DILUTED AND
Line_808	BY ADDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
Line_809	BY ADDING MORE WATER TO A DIFFERENT CUP
Line_810	BECAUSE YOU COULD ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER IN THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_811	THE IN THE PURPLE AND THE BLUE ONE CUP IS CONCENTRATED AND ONE IS DILUTED
Line_812	I CAN SEE THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO CUPS OF SALT WATER SOLUTION THAT ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND THE OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_813	THE ONE OF TWENTY GRAMS SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS SOLUTE CAUSE IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS
Line_814	MY PREDICTION AS CORRECT
Line_815	BECAUSE OF THE TWENTY GRAMS AND THE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE BEING COMPARED WILL BE THE TWENTY GRAMS BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IS TEN MORE GRAMS OF
Line_816	I THINK WHAT HAS TO DO WITH THE MASS AND SOLUTE IS THAT THE MASS IS GREATER AND THAN THE SOLUTE
Line_817	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_818	SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS SOLUTION ONE
Line_819	SOLUTION ONE I MEAN SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_820	SOLUTION THREE SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_821	SOLUTION THE FIRST SOLUTION
Line_822	IT'S SOMETHING AS MUCH AS WHEN WE DROP INTO TANK IT'LL FLOAT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM
Line_823	I THINK THIS MEANS OUR SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT AND SOLUTION A DOES NOT
Line_824	WELL IT WOULD DEPEND ON IF IT HAS SALT OR NOT
Line_825	THEY DID NOT BLEND THEY DID NOT BLEND AND THEY DO NOT WANT
Line_826	I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT SINCE THEY'RE BLENDING IT'S CAUSING A FAR MORE CONCENTRATION AND DILUTE
Line_827	IT WOULD NOT BLEND AND THEY WOULD LOOK CONCERTED FROM CONCENTRATED TO DILUTED
Line_828	NOT BLENDING
Line_829	SOMEONE EITHER ADDED TOO MUCH PRESSURE OR YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EACH
Line_830	IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF GRAMS OF SALT
Line_831	I NOTICED THAT BLUE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS A LITTLE MORE DILUTED THAN GREEN IS
Line_832	THAT THE BLUEST FOUR GRAMS IS THE HEAVIEST SO IT WAS CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS THE SECOND CONCENTRATED AND THEN GREEN IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_833	BECAUSE THE BLUE IS THE HEAVIEST AND GREEN IS A LIGHT
Line_834	HELLO
Line_835	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE FOURS SCOOPS IS MORE AND THE THREE SCOOPS MAKES IT MORE
Line_836	IT'S IS MORE CONCENTRATED THEN DILUTED
Line_837	WELL IT DISSOLVE ALL THE WAY
Line_838	WELL I THINK THAT GOES INTO TO SO I THINK THE SUBSTANCE CREATES THE TINIEST ONE AND THEN I THINK
Line_839	THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST LEADING AND
Line_840	THE CRYSTALS GO AWAY
Line_841	WELL THE CRYSTALS WERE NOT MAKE CLEAR
Line_842	WELL IT GO AND CLEARLY TO THE DISH AND DON'T COME OUT
Line_843	ALL CRYSTALS WOULD BE THE MOST DENSITY
Line_844	WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_845	WELL EVAPORATED TOGETHER AND MAKING A IT ALL MIXTURE THROUGH PRODUCTION
Line_846	IT IS A PRODUCT
Line_847	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_848	IT MAKES IT A SALT CRYSTAL WAIT HAS IT STARTED OUT OH
Line_849	PRECIPITATION IS HAPPENING AND IT MAKES IT MOISTENED AND LIKE SATURATE THE SOLVENT AND TO
Line_850	AND THEN YOU MAKE THE PRECIPITATION GO
Line_851	WHAT IN SCIENCE WELL IT HANDS OVER AND IT MAKES PRECIPITATION
Line_852	WELL AS YOU SHAKE AND MOISTEN THE BAG THE PERSON'S HAND IS MAKING IT PRECIPITATE MORE
Line_853	THE CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED BECAUSE THE HAPPENED AND IT WENT DOWN AND CHANGED
Line_854	THE MAGNET IS BRINGING THE PAPERCLIP
Line_855	THE MAGNET IS MOVING AROUND IN THE PAPERCLIP IS STICKING
Line_856	IT'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_857	MAGNETS
Line_858	WHEN I WENT UP TO IT STOPPED IT WENT DOWN
Line_859	THE WHEN I WENT UP TO AGAIN THE MAGNETS WERE ATTRACTING OUT FIRST BUT THEN IT'S STARTED REPELLING
Line_860	THEY GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER BECAUSE THERE IT'S MORE WASHERS THAN THE MAGNET
Line_861	IT GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER EACH TIME YOU ADD SOMETHING
Line_862	WHEN I ADDED THE WASHER IT GOT SEPARATE THE MAGNETS SEPARATED FROM IT
Line_863	YOU DO ON ADDING AND ADDING AND ADDING
Line_864	WELL NORTH AND SOUTH CAN BE BUT SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH CANNOT
Line_865	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THAT
Line_866	WELL YOU PUT THE BATTERY TO THE WITH A BATTERY
Line_867	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_868	THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_869	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND COMING BACK AROUND AND ROUND
Line_870	MOTOR IS MOVING IT MAKES THE ENERGY COMING BACK AGAIN
Line_871	BECAUSE YOU NEED METAL TO TOUCH IT FOR ENERGY TO WORK FOR ANY OTHER ENERGY
Line_872	IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE THE ENERGY IS TRAPPED
Line_873	FOR THIS SWITCH TOO CLOSE
Line_874	NOTHING'S HAPPENING
Line_875	FOR THE SWITCHER TO TURN TO CLOSE
Line_876	IT DOESN'T WORK THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_877	SUNLIGHT IS IT'S LIKE A CALCULATOR MAKING IT WORK BY THE SUN
Line_878	WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE MOTOR TO RUN IS TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN WORK
Line_879	FOR THE SUNLIGHT TO SHINE ON THE THINGY
Line_880	FOR THE SUN FOR THE MOTOR TO WORK SO IT CAN WORK
Line_881	IT WILL WORK IT WON'T WORK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_882	NO NO
Line_883	IT TURNS THE MOTOR ON
Line_884	IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT FOR THE ENERGY TO WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_885	THE SUN MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_886	THA'S NOT MOVING ANYMORE
Line_887	THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR ANYMORE
Line_888	THIS PICTURE SHOWING IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE D-CELLS FROM THE WIRE
Line_889	THANK YOU A LOT
Line_890	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_891	WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE IT'S ENERGY
Line_892	THE NAIL IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_893	UM
Line_894	A CONDUCTOR MAKES THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_895	IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POPSICLE STICK
Line_896	MADE OF IS PLASTIC SO
Line_897	THAT ELECTRICIY IS ENERGY
Line_898	BECAUSE CONDUCTING IS NOT FLOWING
Line_899	IT'S NOT SPINNING STILL
Line_900	WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT THE PAPER CLIP THAT IS MAKING THE ENERGY FLOW
Line_901	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_902	WE WE'VE BEEN MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME
Line_903	HEAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRODUCES LIGHT
Line_904	I SEE A CANDLE PRODUCING HEAT ENERGY
Line_905	IT IT COMES WAX OFF WAX IT COMES IT HAS HEAT FOR HEAT ENERGY
Line_906	IT MAKES IS BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
Line_907	THE WAX
Line_908	NO N-O
Line_909	IT SOUNDED LIKE NOTHING
Line_910	I SEE THE WAX MELTING AND THE FIRE BURNING
Line_911	WE IT HAS A COLOR THAT WE CAN SEE
Line_912	BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_913	IT PRODUCES SOUND ENERGY
Line_914	YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND WHEN THE STICK IS BANGING ON THE DRUM
Line_915	GIRL IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_916	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_917	BY EATING A HEALTHY SNACK LIKE AN APPLE OR BANANAS OR GRAPES
Line_918	I SEE A FUEL BOX A BRANCH A CANDLE APPLES AND A CABINET
Line_919	IT'S HEATING UP TO TURN TO FIRE
Line_920	IT IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_921	IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_922	IT'S MAKING IT PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_923	I DON'T KNOW
Line_924	BECAUSE THE SOLAR PANEL CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE AND THE WIND THINGY CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE TOO
Line_925	THAT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_926	ENERGY BOOM
Line_927	IMPORTANT BY MAKING STUFF MOVE
Line_928	BUILDING CIRCUITS TETHERS OH NO I DON'T KNOW
Line_929	DOING SWELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
Line_930	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_931	CIRCUIT IS ABOUT TURNING STUFF ON
Line_932	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_933	SO THEY CAN ALL LIGHT UP SO IT CAN MAKE ALL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_934	IT'S MAKING IT LIGHT UP BY A LIGHT BULB I MEAN THE BATTERY
Line_935	THE D-CELLS ARE GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS TO WORK
Line_936	THOSE ARE THE D-CELLS THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_937	BY MAKING THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_938	IS TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_939	BY CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_940	OKAY GOT THAT
Line_941	THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS OF THEM
Line_942	SAY WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE BATTERY AND THERE IS LIKE OF THEM LIGHT BULBS
Line_943	THAT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTER
Line_944	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_945	UM BECAUSE THERE'S THE TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER I DON'T KNOW
Line_946	UM THEY BOTH MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK TO CREATE ENERGY
Line_947	THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING
Line_948	ENERGY
Line_949	IT HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_950	THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING
Line_951	THE BATTERY IS MAKING TWO BULBS WORK
Line_952	THE BULBS ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_953	UM IT'LL GET MORE BRIGHTER
Line_954	I DON'T KNOW
Line_955	ELECTRICITY COMES FROM A BATTERY
Line_956	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY GOING AROUND AND AROUND FROM THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_957	THE IN THIS PICTURE IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_958	THAT THEY'RE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_959	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_960	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SIDE
Line_961	THEY'RE FLOWING BY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_962	THE ENERGY BY THE BLUE LIGHT BULBS AND THE BOTH THE WIRES
Line_963	I NOTICE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP WITH THE WIRE
Line_964	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I FORGOT
Line_965	UM WITH TWO BATTERIES IT MAKE IT BRIGHTER
Line_966	YES
Line_967	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE MORE BRIGHTER
Line_968	BY MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_969	THE SECOND ONE
Line_970	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_971	NOT SO MUCH
Line_972	IT SHOWS A LIGHT BULB
Line_973	IT HAS MAGNET FORCE IN THEM
Line_974	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_975	BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL
Line_976	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_977	BECAUSE IT IS METAL IRON OR STEEL
Line_978	YES BECAUSE IT IS METAL I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_979	I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_980	BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE IRON IN THEM
Line_981	UM MORE METALS STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_982	OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR FORCE FOR IT SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_983	SOME METALS FOR MAGNETS CAN'T STICK SO IT CAN'T WORK
Line_984	IRON
Line_985	UM IRON CAN STICK TO METAL BECAUSE IT HAS LITTLE MAGNETS IN THEM
Line_986	THE ONE THAT'S NOT ALUMINUM BECAUSE THAT HAS MORE FORCE IN IT I DON'T THINK IT'S METAL
Line_987	SO THE ROCK THE RING AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL CAN'T STICK
Line_988	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO METAL IN IT
Line_989	THAT GRAY BLOCK DOESN'T STICK
Line_990	THAT IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT HASNO METAL IN IT OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_991	STICK BECAUSE IT HAS-IT'S METAL
Line_992	IT'S WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT SO LIKE LITTLE STUFF IN THERE
Line_993	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL INSIDE IT
Line_994	IRON METAL STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_995	TALKED ABOUT STUFF THAT CAN STICK TO METAL AND STUFF THAT CAN'T STICK TO METAL
Line_996	ONE IS WIRE TWO WIRES A BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_997	THEY GIVE OUT ENERGY FOR STUFF
Line_998	SOURCE IS ANOTHER WORD FOR SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU I GUESS
Line_999	UM WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GIVE MORE ENERGY KIND OF
Line_1000	I THINK IT'S JUST POSSIBLY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PATH BECAUSE IT'S SO LIKE THEN
Line_1001	LIGHT BULBS ARE SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU LIGHT
Line_1002	THEY HELP YOU SEE IN MANY PLACES
Line_1003	A RECEIVER IS ANOTHER WORD FOR A LIGHT BULB
Line_1004	THAT MEANS THAT'S HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER THEY DID VERY GOOD AND THAT THEY MADE LIGHT
Line_1005	REAL TINY ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE IS ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE BATTTERY
Line_1006	IT KIND OF DEPENDS
Line_1007	UM WHERE OTHER IS A MINUS SIGN
Line_1008	WELL THERE IS RED ON THAT SIDE AND THERE IS UM A FLAT SIDE ON THAT SIDE
Line_1009	THAT THE BATTERY TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S DOING THE OPPOSITE THING
Line_1010	NOW IT IS-THE MINUS SIGN IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE BATTERY AGAIN
Line_1011	I'M SORRY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1012	ARE NOT CONNECTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND MAKE LIGHT WITH THAT
Line_1013	IT WILL NOT CREATE ENERGY AND YOUR BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1014	OKAY BYE YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO ME I HOPE I SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1015	A LITTLE FLAG IS MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT MEANS THAT IS WORKING
Line_1016	IF THE FLAG IS MOVING THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1017	IT NEEDS ENERGY FOR IT TO RUN OR GASOLINE
Line_1018	UM THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1019	IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT TURNS OFF
Line_1020	IT TURNS ON ONCE YOU UH TURN ON THE SWITCH
Line_1021	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1022	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1023	BECAUSE THE FLAG COULDN'T MOVE
Line_1024	NO BECAUSE IF CLOUDY DAY IS BLOCKING THE SUN
Line_1025	WHEN IT'S CLOUDY THE LITTLE FLAG STOPS
Line_1026	SUN IS MOVING AND WORKING
Line_1027	WHEN THE SUN GIVES TO THE MOTOR IT STARTS TO MOVE
Line_1028	MOVING A FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1029	UM THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1030	WELL USUALLY WHAT MAKES THE MOTOR WORK IS METAL NOTHING ELSE PRETTY MUCH WORKS
Line_1031	USUALLY UH A NAIL
Line_1032	NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENING INSIDE AND
Line_1033	USUALLY AN INSULATOR IS METAL AND A CONDUCTOR IS USUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
Line_1034	INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL YEAH
Line_1035	OKAY IT STARTS MOVING BECAUSE UM IT IS NOT METAL
Line_1036	THEY UM THEY DON'T WORK I GUESS
Line_1037	WELL CONDUCTORS ARE UM SOMETHING METAL USUALLY
Line_1038	BYE
Line_1039	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORKS IN ONE CIRCUIT
Line_1040	BECAUSE WITHOUT ENERGY WE COULDN'T BE MOVING
Line_1041	YOU WOULD SAY FUEL HEAT
Line_1042	THE HEAT IS PROBABLY FLOWING AND GIVING US ENERGY
Line_1043	YES I HEAR FLAMES BURNING
Line_1044	SUN IS KIND OF LIKE A
Line_1045	FIRE OR THE FLAME IS MOVING SIDE TO SIDE
Line_1046	IT MAKES THE BIG THUMP
Line_1047	IT'S BECAUSE ENERGY IS USUALLY WHEN YOU MOVE
Line_1048	IT MAKES A LOUD SOUND AND YOU'RE WASTING YOUR ENERGY
Line_1049	YOU CAN HEAR A LOUD SOUND
Line_1050	THE GIRL IS USING HER ENERGY TO WALK
Line_1051	MY FOOD AND APPLES FRUITS VEGETABLES
Line_1052	THERE UH IT WOULD CAUSE A FLAME
Line_1053	YOU SEE KIND OF LIKE A GRAY THING LIKE A GRAY CLOUD GOING UP
Line_1054	BY WIND
Line_1055	THEY GET ENERGY BY THE SAME THING
Line_1056	I-THEIR ENERGIED BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1057	FLAME IT WOULD CREATE A HUGE FLAME
Line_1058	BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT ENERGY-THEY GET ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1059	YOU WOULD HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
Line_1060	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT UP TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1061	A CIRCUIT MAKES A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT HELPS INSTEAD OF USING YOUR HANDS
Line_1062	CIRCUIT HELPS A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1063	THE EXACT SAME THING JUST TWIST IT'S EASIER BECAUSE SOME MATERIALS THE CIRCUIT HOLDS
Line_1064	PATHWAY
Line_1065	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_1066	WE THINK OF THEM AS LITTLE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE PATHWAY INTO KIND OF LIKE A CAVE
Line_1067	WHEN YOU ADD MORE D-CELLS THEY START TO LIGHT UP MORE AND MORE
Line_1068	MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO BE OBSTRUCTING WAY FOR IT TO LIGHT UP
Line_1069	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1070	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH BATTERIES
Line_1071	THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF MAGNETS FIRST IT'S A DONUT MAGNET THEN IT'S A HORSESHOE MAGNET AND THEN IT'S JUST A REGULAR MAGNET
Line_1072	WELL THEY CARRY ENERGY INSIDE OF IT AND STICK TO ANYTHING STEEL AND METAL
Line_1073	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1074	YES BECAUSE THE WHOLE ENTIRE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL SO STEEL STICKS TO ANYTHING THAT MADE IT
Line_1075	IT'S LIKE PROBABLY LIKE LITTLE TINY MAGNETS BECAUSE SOME MAGNETS UM STICK TOGETHER
Line_1076	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL THE OTHER ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL SO IT WON'T BE ABLE TO STICK
Line_1077	OH MY GOD THAT STICKS I NEVER KNEW THAT WOW I JUST LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TODAY
Line_1078	UM STEEL THAT'S FOR SURE STEEL
Line_1079	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIGHTER LIGHT BULB
Line_1080	THEY ARE CLOSE TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1081	WHEN THE WIRES UM ARE ATTACHED TO THE BATTERY AND ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB THEY MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTER
Line_1082	THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH TO ENERGY THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB GLOW ON AND THE WIRES THAT HIT IT
Line_1083	IT HELPS THE ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE BATTERY FOR THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1084	IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE
Line_1085	THEY ARE A PATH WAY FROM THE BATTERY WHICH IS THE SOURCE ENERGY SOURCE AND TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE A LIGHTER
Line_1086	ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
Line_1087	THEY CARRY ENERGY OR UM ELECTRICITY SO THAT IT MAKES SO LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1088	THE LIGHT BULB HERE ON IS FOR THE WIRES AND THE BATTERIES SO THEY WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1089	IN THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE FILAMENT IN THE FILAMENT UM HELPS IT LIGHT UP
Line_1090	IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY
Line_1091	WHEN IT DOES THIS I THINK THERE IS ELECTRICITY SO THEN WE CAN HAVE LIGHT
Line_1092	THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1093	THE NEGATIVE RIVET IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1094	IT COMES TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES TOWARDS THE WIRE AND COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE BATTERY
Line_1095	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1096	THE UM ELECTRICITY BLUE DOTS ARE GOING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_1097	IT TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY STARTED FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1098	IT GOES BACK THE WAY THAEN IT STARTED
Line_1099	IT MIGHT GO FASTER OR THEY WOULD BOTH HIT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT MIGHT LIGHT UP OR MAY NOT
Line_1100	WHEN THEY ARE AROUND ONCE ON THE SIDE AND ONCE ON THE BOTTOM IT WORKS SPLITTING THEY BOTH BOTTOM AND DOESN'T WORK
Line_1101	THE MOTOR THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1102	IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S UM HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1103	IT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING IN IT'S THE ENERGY IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_1104	IT IS THE ENERGY AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CAR YOU NEED THE BATTERY FOR THE CAR FOR ITS WORK
Line_1105	IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE ONE SIDE WHICH SHOULD BE GOOD AND THAT'S WHY THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING
Line_1106	THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR STARTS WORKING SO THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING IT NOT WORK
Line_1107	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING WELL IS LIKE CLOSED
Line_1108	A SOLAR THING IS MAKES SOMETHINGS WORK
Line_1109	IF THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEN THERE IS NO ENERGY COMING DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO MAKE THE LIGHT
Line_1110	IT WON'T WORK WE WERE GOING DO THAT TODAY ALSO BUT IT WAS CLOUDY DAY SO IT DIDN'T WORK IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK
Line_1111	IT MAKES THE SOLAR PANEL HAVE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR YOU SHOWED ME THIS BEFORE AND THAT CAN ENOUGH
Line_1112	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE FLAG IS MOVING THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1113	YOU TOO BYE MARNIE
Line_1114	GOOD HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU A MARNIE
Line_1115	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_1116	I SEE THAT THE GENERATED FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TURNED LIKE TO WHERE IT WOULD BE ON
Line_1117	MAKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS IT WORKS RIGHT
Line_1118	OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DON'T WORK
Line_1119	BYE MARNIE THANKS FOR THE TUTORING BYE
Line_1120	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY
Line_1121	THIS IS THE CANDLE AND IT'S LIKE IT THE WARM WE DID A HAND RUBBING
Line_1122	THE HEAT IS MAKING THE IT'S SO HOT AND IT MAKES THE WAX MELT IT'S LIKE A CAR WHEN YOU GO IT BURNT OF THE GAS
Line_1123	I THINK WHEN I WENT BUY IT OR I CAN SEE IT'S LIKE HOT
Line_1124	THAT GAS OR THE WAX IS LIKE GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE HEAT IS LIKE MAKING IT SO HOT THAT THEN WAX MELTS
Line_1125	UM LIGHT
Line_1126	THERE WAS NO SOUND THERE WAS NO SOUND NOT AT ALL
Line_1127	A PERSON IS BEING ON DRUMS
Line_1128	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE IS EATING FOOD SHE IS EATING AN APPLE
Line_1129	IT IS MAKING SOUNDS
Line_1130	I SEE WOOD FUEL LIKE GASOLINE I SEE A CANDLE AND THREE APPLES
Line_1131	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH LIKE THE WIRE AND THE BATTERY
Line_1132	IT'S ALL CONNECTED
Line_1133	OKAY WELL IN THE ELECTRICITY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1134	THE WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_1135	OKAY MARNIE THE CIRCUIT IS THE WHOLE THING CONNECTED AND THE PATHWAYS ARE THE WIRES
Line_1136	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE
Line_1137	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING AND GOING
Line_1138	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE LITTLE THE ENERGY
Line_1139	OKAY I DID THAT MARNIE NOW WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO
Line_1140	USUALLY ONE OR TWO OR MORE
Line_1141	WHEN YOU ADD A D-CELL BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND WORK
Line_1142	WHEN YOU TAKE A BATTERY AWAY THEN LIGHT BULBS AREN'T AS BRIGHT
Line_1143	IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
Line_1144	ON THE ONE D-CELL THAT LIGHTS AREN'T BRIGHT AT ALL BUT ON THE TWO D-CELLS THE LIGHTS ARE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT
Line_1145	YES AND WHAT IT LIKE WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER D-CELL THE THE BULBS OR LIGHTS GOT VERY BRIGHT
Line_1146	WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1147	IT HAS IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_1148	I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THE WIRES
Line_1149	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE
Line_1150	THE PATHWAY IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1151	THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND IT MOVES LIKE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1152	THE PATHWAY OR THE WIRES OR BOTH THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
Line_1153	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE LITTLE DOTS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1154	ELECTRICITY IS GOING LIKE TUP TUP TUP TUP TUP TUP THROUGH LIKE LITTLE PIZZAS OF ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING
Line_1155	YOU WILL HAVE TO ADD MORE COMPONENTS LIKE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE WIRES
Line_1156	IF WE HAD MORE THAN ONE D-CELL THE BULBS WILL LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1157	I SEE THAT SOME OF THE TIME THE BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY IT'S DIFFERENT
Line_1158	WITH TWO D-CELLS IT GOES BRIGHTER BUT ONCE THE ONE LIGHT BUT GETS TAKEN AWAY THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK
Line_1159	BECAUSE BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDES AND NOT THE POSITIVE
Line_1160	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1161	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY
Line_1163	I SEE TWO BULBS AND ONE D-CELL
Line_1164	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1165	THE LIGHTS WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT OR A LOT BRIGHT
Line_1166	I JUST TOLD YOU
Line_1167	UM MAYBE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1168	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1169	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1170	THEY'RE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND WIRE
Line_1171	A D-CELL BATTERY
Line_1172	THEY'RE ALL ABOUT UM HOW THEY POWER EVERYTHING I I THINK
Line_1173	I MEAN LIKE IT POWERS MOSTLY EVERYTHING
Line_1174	POWER ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SOURCE
Line_1175	LIGHT BULBS UM HELP LIGHT COME IN TO
Line_1176	IT MEANS THAT UM IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROOM TO GET LIGHTER
Line_1177	IT'S UM GOING UP AND DOWN AND UNDER
Line_1178	THE BOTTOM ONE WHICH IS BRINGING THE POWER AGAIN THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_1179	PAPERS AND THE POWER ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE D-CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1180	I NOTICE IT SWITCHED AROUND SO IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW
Line_1181	IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT IS GOING BEFORE
Line_1182	IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY AROUND
Line_1183	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1184	I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1185	I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAK THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1186	LEARNING HOW TO POWER AH POWER A MOTOR
Line_1187	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D-CELL IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES IT POWER THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAGS SPIN
Line_1188	FOR ELECTRICITY TO POWER TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR FOR THE FLAG
Line_1189	AND THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1190	THE WIRES ARE UM COMING OUT OF THE D-CELL TO THE MOTOR AND THERE IS ALSO SWITCH
Line_1191	AND IT GETS THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_1192	THE FLAG THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE D-CELL ALL WAY TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1193	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
Line_1194	WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT IN THE MIDDLE IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE MIDDLE THE FLAG STARTS SPINING
Line_1195	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING
Line_1196	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THAT TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING FLAG SPIN
Line_1197	FOR THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO THROUGH FROM THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_1198	POWER GOT TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THAT POWER IN THE MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1199	THE POWER IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG WORK
Line_1200	TRYING TO PULL OBJECTS ON SWITCH FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1201	THAT HEAT FROM THE CANDLE IS MELTING THE CANDLES
Line_1202	IT UM ITS BURNING THE CANDLE
Line_1203	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED IT UM TO HAVE LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING
Line_1204	HEAT HEAT
Line_1205	I CAN SEE HEATS UM HEAT ENERGY FIRE AND THE CANDLES MELTING
Line_1206	SOUND ENERGY
Line_1207	I CAN TELL BECAUSE KEEP ON THE ENERGY TO WALK RUN AND SIT
Line_1208	ENERGY MAKES YOU WALK AND RUN AND SLEEP AND YOU CAN TELL SHE HAS ENERGY BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING
Line_1209	BY EATING AND DRINKING LOTS OF WATER
Line_1210	THE MOTOR AND THE FLAG WOULDN'T
Line_1211	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1212	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME
Line_1213	I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW YEAH PLEASE TELL ME PLEASE MARNIE
Line_1214	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING NUMBER SCIENCE
Line_1215	IT'S A CANDLE AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING SCIENCE FARE
Line_1216	IT'S MELTING YEAH IT'S MELTING
Line_1217	NO BECAUSE I NEVER TOUCHED FIRE THAT WOULD BE VERY STUPIDITY TO DO AND THERE ARE COOL
Line_1218	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY
Line_1219	THAT'S SOUND LIKE THIS
Line_1220	IT'S FLAMING
Line_1221	SOUND ENERGY FROM THAT PERSON THAT HAS TALKING THE BONGOS AND MAKE THEM STOP
Line_1222	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME
Line_1223	THERE'S NO FEEL THERE'S A GIRL WALKING EATING APPLE IF STICK THAT SHE'S GREAT CREEPY
Line_1224	EATING
Line_1225	DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING BUT I DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE BETTER TO DO
Line_1226	FIRE WILL COME FIRE THERE
Line_1227	LIKE YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE SAID THAT HERE YOU BECAUSE I WAS TALKING YEAH YOUR WEIRD PERKY
Line_1228	SOUND HA
Line_1229	SILENCE
Line_1230	WHY DO YOU WANT I KNOW MORNIE
Line_1231	I HAVE NO PLAN INSIDE
Line_1232	HA UMM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1233	THERE'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'RE TWO DIFFERENT THEY
Line_1234	I TOLD YOU I FREAKED DOWN NO LADY
Line_1235	CAN YOU LEAVE NOW PLEASE JUST ASKING
Line_1236	UN-RENEWABLE SOURCES
Line_1237	USING MAGNETS SO YOU HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_1238	THE CIRCUITS ABOUT A FALSE CIRCUIT
Line_1239	AH UMM
Line_1240	ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES THOSE CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS CIRCUIT WIRE
Line_1241	FOR AN ELECTRICITY BE GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1242	IF WIRES BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE ONE OF THE WIRE IS ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHICH SHOULD MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1243	THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRICITY
Line_1244	IT WOULD BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY WILL
Line_1245	THEY LONG GLOW POSSIBLY
Line_1246	IT REFLECTED BY IT WILL GET MAY BE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND MORE D CELL TO YOU GET FIT IN THIS
Line_1247	I'M
Line_1248	WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONLY THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAVE THAT WHAT
Line_1249	AH AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_1250	CLOSE CIRCUITS OPEN THE CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS
Line_1251	I THINK IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1252	SO YEAH SO CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1253	WE'VE TWO YOU CAN'T ONLY HAVE TWO BATTERIES OR LIGHT BULBS IN A CIRCUIT
Line_1254	I SAID
Line_1255	MORNIE CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1256	I HAVE NO IF GRADATE CHICK YOU TELL ME AND HAVE A
Line_1257	WHICH TWO BATTERIES AND ONE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT WORK THAT WAS TWO BATTERIES TWO LIGHT BULBS THEN OVER
Line_1258	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE I THINK THAT'S YOUR GREAT JOB
Line_1259	I THINK NUMBER ONE WHICH IS ON THE TOP
Line_1260	I THINK CIRCUIT NUMBER TWO AND HAS STRUCTURE CLEAN EVERYTHING
Line_1261	BE EVEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND
Line_1262	CAN YOU REPEAT UP THIS SLOWLY
Line_1263	THEN YOU DON'T HAVE A CIRCUIT THEY BOTH
Line_1264	A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1265	AH UMM I WOULD KNOW THAT
Line_1266	YEAH HEY SORRY CAN WE PUT THAT SLOWLY OR CAN YOU SAY LIKE A TICK MARK
Line_1267	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW HAVE A FALSE CIRCUIT
Line_1268	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT SLOWLY
Line_1269	HMM CAN YOU NOT I DON'T KNOW
Line_1270	BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CRACKS
Line_1271	THE LIGHT BULB FILAMENT IS NOT LIGHTING
Line_1272	CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME MY KNOWING FRIENDS RIHANA WAS PARKING ME
Line_1273	KIDDING KNOW THAT I DOING FORM RIHANA IT'S BEING
Line_1274	THANK RIHANA IT'S A LIGHT BULB
Line_1275	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT RIHANA BACK TO MEDINA WAS BUGGING
Line_1276	WHY DON'T A LIGHT TAKE IT'S UP
Line_1277	THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN
Line_1278	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN
Line_1279	BESIDES CAN YOU GO REPEAT AND GET ME A FILAMENT
Line_1280	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1281	IF SOUTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL STICK BY SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL REPEAL
Line_1282	AH UMM I CAN'T CAN WE USE GET TO LISTEN
Line_1283	IT'S METAL SO EITHER TRACK A MAGNET
Line_1284	A NAIL IS STICKING TO A DOUGHNUT SHAPED MAGNET
Line_1285	IT'S STICKS BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL
Line_1286	THE METAL DOESN'T ATTRACT TO THE BLOCK BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
Line_1287	BECAUSE WOOD CAN'T ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_1288	BECAUSE THE NAIL HAS ONE NAIL HAS IRON IN METAL AND THE OTHER DOESN'T IT
Line_1289	IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_1290	I THINK IT'S HAS METAL OR STEEL OR IRON IT BECAUSE IT'S STICKING
Line_1291	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1292	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT DOES HAS IRON METAL OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1293	BECAUSE THE STEEL METAL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1294	I'M GOOD I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1295	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1296	A BATTERY OF LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
Line_1297	THE D CELL HAS BEEN IMPORTING BECAUSE THEN IT GIVES UP ELECTRICIY DON'T MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1298	IT MEANS LIKE IT'S A PATHWAY TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ENERGY IN THE WIRES
Line_1299	I THINK TRAVELS MEANS LIKE IT GOES LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND NOW TO THE LIGHT BULB TO SEND OFF ELECTRICITY
Line_1300	THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY
Line_1301	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ABOUT LIKE TO THE SEND THOSE LIGHT SO THEN YOU COULD SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IT'S NOT JUST A PITCH BLACK PLATE
Line_1302	IT MEANS LIKE A RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE WIRES
Line_1303	I SEE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE LINE GOING IN THE CIRCUIT SO THAN THEY COULD GIVE MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1304	IT IS FLOWING THOUGH LEFT TO WAY LIKE IT GOES DRINE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THEN OR IT'S GOING AROUND
Line_1305	HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_1306	THROUGH ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE WIRES I SEE IN THIS PICTURE I WAS GOING THROUGH IN GOING NOW THAT'S HOW IT WORK
Line_1307	THE END OF THE D CELL LIKE WITH THE MINUS ON A
Line_1308	IT'S FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1309	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THAT THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_1310	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING I'M SORRY I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING
Line_1311	IT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY WHICH GOING NOW ITS GOING THE LEFT WING NOT DIRECT
Line_1312	IT GOES TO OPPOSITE WAY IT WAS FLOWING
Line_1313	THE MINUS
Line_1314	WHAT SET UP I DON'T SEE ANY SETUP
Line_1315	I DON'T SEEN ANYTHING SO CAN YOU GIVE SOME HANDS ABOUT
Line_1316	THE D CELL TO MAKE IT WORK IF THERE WAS IN A D CELL THEN NOW THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1317	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING AND IT WON'T WORK
Line_1318	I KNOW SAW WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH IS THE FAST OF THE MOVING THEIR ONE CLICKED AGAIN THEN ITS STOPS MOVING
Line_1319	I NOTICED AT THE MOTOR HAS A WIRES AT THE TREE IN THE WIRE IS ALL TOP TO OTHER SOLAR POWER
Line_1320	IF THE FLOURISH TURNING THEN IT MEANS THAT ITS COLLECTING ENERGY FORM THE SOLAR POWER TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_1321	IT WON'T WORK AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THIS MOTOR WORK
Line_1322	THE FLAG IS THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_1323	WHAT I KNOW THIS IS THE FLAG IS NOT MOVING
Line_1324	IF FLAG IS MOVING THEN THEY MEAN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER
Line_1325	HELLO HOW IS YOUR DAY
Line_1326	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1327	CAN YOU PLEASE ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1328	AND WHERE IS AT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BY THE PAPERCLIP BECAUSE IT'S A METAL
Line_1329	AH ANYTHING THAT'S METAL CONDUCTS A MOTOR
Line_1330	I NOTICED THAT IF THEY STICK WOOD AND DOESN'T COLLECT DOOM LIKE FOR STICK AND THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_1331	IT'S HAVE CRIMINAL
Line_1332	CAN YOU REPEAT A QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1333	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1334	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT I'VE KNOWING LITTLE KID RIGHT RIGHT NOW AROUND IN IS BEING IS STUCK AND SMACK SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1335	THE MOTOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTOR IS DOESN'T
Line_1336	PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1337	THEY ARE MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1338	RIGHT NOW SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT PLEASE REPEAT
Line_1339	THE BRASS RING THE PAPERCLIP THE AH WHOLE DONE
Line_1340	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1341	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1342	WE'VE BEEN DOING OR SEE WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS THE LIVE ONE BATTERY
Line_1343	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FUEL
Line_1344	IT GIVES OFF HEATS AND MY
Line_1345	NO I DON'T HEARING EVEN A CANDLE BURNS
Line_1346	IF A CANDLE DIDN'T MAKE SOUND THEY DON'T MAKE LIKE
Line_1347	I CAN SEE THAT THE FLAME IS MOVING BACK AND FORWARD FOR SLOWLY
Line_1348	I SEE THEY HAVE THERE'S UH A FEW WOOD AND THE CANDLE AND THIS IS THREE APPLES
Line_1349	THINKING AROUND
Line_1350	IT TURNED INTO SMOKE
Line_1351	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1352	THE MOTOR THEY'VE MOTOR START RESTART SPINNING IN A CIRCLE UH
Line_1353	REPEAT
Line_1354	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_1355	THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY
Line_1356	COAL AND GAS ARE MAKE A FIRE
Line_1357	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1358	REPEAT
Line_1359	I DO NOT COMPLETELY NO
Line_1360	UM REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1361	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1362	I CAN THEM WOULD RUN OUT OF ENERGY IS AT MORE LIGHT BULBS IN THE OWN WITH HAVE BRIGHT
Line_1363	REPEAT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Line_1364	IF YOU HAVE ONE MORE ONE MORE D-CELLS THOUGH LIGHT BULB LIKE BRIGHTER
Line_1365	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1366	PEOPLE DO IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN DOING SOCIAL STUDIES NOT SCIENCE
Line_1367	WELL I ASSURED ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT IS THAT TAKE A STICK TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1368	BUT IT GOES HAVE TO DO IT STICKING TO A MAGNET IS AT ALL A MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS IRON AND STEEL
Line_1369	WHAT'S IN THE METAL IS IT LIKE TINY BITS IRON OR STEEL SO IT HELPS ITS STICK
Line_1370	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1371	IT IS TRUE THE PAPER CLIPS MADE UP IRON OR STEEL
Line_1372	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1373	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1374	WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THAT AND
Line_1375	I THINK THAT BECAUSE I LEARNT IT
Line_1376	THEY ARE FACING SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER'S AND NORTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHERS ARE REPEL
Line_1377	SOME OF THEM IS THE SOUTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THEY ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE FACING THEIR OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO THEY ATTRACT
Line_1378	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1379	WHAT WE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS THAT SO LEARNED ABOUT MAGNET AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_1380	HM
Line_1381	WHAT MAKES ME SHE THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED WITH THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP AND BROKE I BROKE THAT UP TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WHICH I LIKE ATTRACT
Line_1382	OKAY WHICH THE MAGNET IS SENDING A MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO PICK UP OTHERS STUFF OKAY
Line_1383	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1384	THAT YOU MUST PAY YOUR PARENTS
Line_1385	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1386	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS SO ACTUALLY WE ARE LEARNING HOW
Line_1387	WHICH IS ABOUT IS THAT YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT A MAGNETIC WILL ATTRACT
Line_1388	AND MAKES ME SEE THAT BECAUSE I TESTED IT OUT
Line_1389	WHAT'S ABOUT THAT I HATE YOU AND BYE
Line_1390	NOT REALLY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1391	SKIP ME PLEASE I'M TIRED
Line_1392	THE SET UP IS THAT YOU HAVE TO POOP YOUR PANTS
Line_1393	REPEAT REPEAT I SAID REPEAT
Line_1394	LEAVE ME ALONE I WANT TO BE DONE
Line_1395	UM I COLLECTED FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_1396	PLEAS LEAVE ME ALONE
Line_1397	LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1398	A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1399	THEY POWERS STUFF LIKE COMPUTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_1400	ITS STORES ENERGY AND THEN IT GIVES OTHER THINGS ENERGY TO USE
Line_1401	I DON'T KNOW DON'T
Line_1402	I LIKE
Line_1403	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THEY RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES OR THE BATTERY
Line_1404	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COMES BACK IN TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1405	WELL LIKE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE POSITIVE END
Line_1406	IT GOES TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_1407	IT GOES BACK TO WHAT WISH NORMALLY AT THE ELECTRICITY FLOW BACK TO ASIDE THEY WERE GOING TO THE IN THE FIRST
Line_1408	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE TOUCH
Line_1409	THEY WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T FLOW LIKE IT'S SUPPOSE TO
Line_1410	THE SIDES THE SIDES WORK
Line_1411	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING LEARNING HOW MOTOR WORK
Line_1412	BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D-CELL IN THE MOTOR IS POWERING THE FLAG
Line_1413	THAT THERE IS POWER IN THE MOTOR IT HAS ENDED
Line_1414	THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D-CELL
Line_1415	IT MIGHT I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY DON'T
Line_1416	IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER SO THE FLAG CAN RUN
Line_1417	THIS IS A MOTOR WITH A SWITCH A CIRCUIT WITHOUT SWITCH
Line_1418	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_1419	BECAUSE THE SWITCH WAS IN TOUCHING THE WIRE
Line_1420	IT STOPS BECAUSE IT CAN FLOWS TO THE PART TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1421	THE SWITCH NEEDS BE CLOSE
Line_1422	ONE IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE THE MOTOR SPINS ONE IT'S NOT THE MOTOR STOP SPINNING
Line_1423	I WAS ABSENT THAT DAY
Line_1424	THAT THE SUN IS THERE TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_1425	IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1426	THE THE FLAG STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1427	IT PRODUCES ENERGY SO THE SOLAR PANELS CAN GET ENERGY FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1428	IT IS A CIRCUIT WITH A MOTOR
Line_1429	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_1430	HOW ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SOMETHING IT'S PUT NOT OTHER
Line_1431	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1432	THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1433	SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE LIST WORKS PUT OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE SPONGE AND THE WAX
Line_1434	THAT WITH A STICK THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_1435	IT IS OPENED
Line_1436	IT DOESN'T IT STOPS SPINNING
Line_1437	I COULDN'T MOVE MY ITEMS SO
Line_1438	THEY ARE METAL
Line_1439	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS ATTRACTS AND REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1440	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1441	THEY'RE MAKING THE WIPE THE TWO WHITE BULBS SLIDING
Line_1442	THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_1443	IT IS IN JUST TWO WIRES IT'S FOUR WIRES
Line_1444	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATH WAY
Line_1445	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATH WAY
Line_1446	THERE LIGHTING OUT FREELY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE I THINK THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN OH WHAT DO YOU PATH WAY
Line_1447	THE LIGHT BULBS WAS SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1448	WE'VE BEEN WORKING IT WAS SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1449	REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_1450	IT IS SHOWING WHAT PATHWAY IT'S GOING
Line_1451	THERE IS TWO PATH WAYS BUT ONE D-CELL
Line_1452	LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOPPER BRIGHTER THAN THE LIGHT BULBS ON THE BOTTOM
Line_1453	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_1454	NEED TO THEY NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_1455	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A CONNECTIVE IT'S NOT
Line_1456	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT DOESN'T
Line_1457	YEAH ITS REPLACE THE LIGHT BULB OR D-CELL
Line_1458	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WORKS BETTER THAN A NORMAL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATH
Line_1459	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY OF ENERGY
Line_1460	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_1461	AFTER WE REPLACES IT WITHIN OTHER A LIGHT BULB
Line_1462	THE LIGHT BULB BURNED OUT AND NOW THE HERE IS NO PATHWAY
Line_1463	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
Line_1464	THE LIGHT BULB BURNED OUT
Line_1465	THE LIGHT BULB BURNED OUT
Line_1466	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1467	A SERIES I MEAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1468	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS KEEPS SLIDING
Line_1469	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS STILL KEEPS GIVING LIGHT
Line_1470	ONE FILAMENT BROKE BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS ARE STILL WORKING
Line_1471	THE FILAMENT IT BURNS OUT BUT THE LIGHT BULB THE OTHER LIGHT BULB SOAKED
Line_1472	THEY ALL CONNECT TO THE D-CELL
Line_1473	THERE IS A BURN OUT FILAMENT
Line_1474	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BROKEN THERE IS NO OTHER PATHWAY TOP GETS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1476	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1477	I LEARN THAT IN CLASS THAT IRON OR STEEL ATTRACT MAGNETS
Line_1478	THE THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1479	THERE IS IRON AND STEEL IN THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_1480	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET THE
Line_1481	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL IN THE NAIL
Line_1482	YES THERE IS IRON OR STEEL IN THE NAIL
Line_1483	WOOD DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1484	IRONS ARE ALL MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_1485	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF IT
Line_1486	ARE THEY STICK TO MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1487	ONE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_1488	THE ONE THAT IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_1489	THE STUFF THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN ITS STICKS WITH THE STARS DOES THAT'S NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1490	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN
Line_1491	IT STICKS
Line_1492	IT MIGHT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT AND THAT'S
Line_1493	SOME METALS HAVE IRON IN THEM OR STEEL AND THOSE WAS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1494	BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF
Line_1495	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1496	NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH STICK TOGETHER BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPELLENT SOUTH AND SOUTH REPELLENT
Line_1497	THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE MAGNET ARE STICKING
Line_1498	BECAUSE SIDES NORTH AND NORTH REPEL BUT SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1499	SIDES NORTH AND NORTH SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL BUT NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1500	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING OR SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ATTRACTING
Line_1501	A GROW HIKING NORTH
Line_1502	I DON'T KNOW IT'S POINTING NORTH
Line_1503	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACTS BUT NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1504	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1505	SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACTS BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1506	THERE IS A MAGNET MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUT THE TABLE IS STOPPING IF AND GETTING ALL THE WAY THERE
Line_1507	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FORCE TO REACH THE PAPER SO IT CAN MOVE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1508	THE MAGNET IS TRAVELLING THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1509	ALL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELLING INTO THE NAIL AND IT'S MAKING IT ACTS LIKE AN
Line_1510	THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAILS STICK LIKE A MAGNET SO THE PAPER CLIP CAN STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_1511	THE MAGNET NEEDS TO BE A REALLY STRONG
Line_1512	AT THE TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_1513	BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORCE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRAVELS TO THE NAIL AND PICKS UP THE PAPER
Line_1514	IT HELPS NAILS GET ON MAGNETIC FORCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1515	ARE THE NAIL WOULD LOSE ITS FORCE
Line_1516	IT WONT BECAME A FROM MAGNET IS IN TOUCHING IT
Line_1517	ALL THE MAGNETS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET WHICH IS PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1518	IT'S BECOMING A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_1519	IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET IS TOUCHING IT AND THEN IT HAS A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1520	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1521	THE NAIL IS BECOMING A TEMPORARILY A MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1522	BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1523	IT SHOWING OF A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1524	IF IT'S IF A MAGNET IS TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT THING CAN BECOME TEMPORARY
Line_1525	THE MAGNET IS GIVING THE THE NAIL A MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1526	WHY
Line_1527	IT'S CHECKING HOW MANY WASHERS THEY CAN TAKE INTO THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS IS BROKEN UP
Line_1528	ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE IS TWO MAGNETS AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS A BUNCH OF WASHERS
Line_1529	WHEN I ADD MORE WASHERS THIS
Line_1530	IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT
Line_1531	THE DISTANCE IS GOING
Line_1532	IT IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE
Line_1533	THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1534	THE FORCE IS IN STRONG ENOUGH SO EVEN ONE WASHER COULD BREAK UP THE WHOLE AH THE WHOLE FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_1535	YOU PUT MORE SPACERS
Line_1536	THE MAGNETIC FORCE GETS UM GETS EASIER TO BREAK EVERY TIME YOU ADD A SPACER
Line_1537	IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE A LITTLE
Line_1538	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1539	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET SIDES NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1540	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1541	GETTING THE REVIT TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET
Line_1542	YOU RAPID AROUND THE REVIT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN
Line_1543	IT MAKES THE RIVET BECOME A MAGNET
Line_1544	IT BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1545	WHEN ITS CLOSED IT'S THE RIVET BECOMES THE MAGNET BUT WHEN ITS OPENED IT STARTS
Line_1546	IT STARTS BECOMING A MAGNET
Line_1547	THERE IS AN ELECTRONIC FORCE AROUND THE WRAPPED WIRE
Line_1548	IT HAVE TO WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_1549	AH YOU KNOW NEED A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1550	THE RIVET BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1551	IT OPENS OR CLOSES THE
Line_1552	IT HAS TO BE NEXT TO THE RIVET
Line_1553	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPENED THEN THE STEEL RIVET IS IN THE MAGNET ONE ITS CLOSED IT'S A MAGNET
Line_1554	ENERGY AND
Line_1555	WIRE BATTERY IN
Line_1556	A BATTERY IN A PARALLEL WIRES IN A LIGHT BULB
Line_1557	THE WIRES UM IF YOU PUT THEM INTO THE THEY WERE UM YOU MAKE TO TRANSFER THE ENERGY
Line_1558	THE BATTERY IN THE LIGHT BULB ONE
Line_1559	THE BATTERY IS A UM LIKE A
Line_1560	A LIGHT BULB NEEDS POWER
Line_1561	THE SOURCE OF ENERGY MEANS THAT UM ITS STORES ENERGY
Line_1562	IT PROVIDES ENERGY
Line_1563	TO PROVIDE ENERGY
Line_1564	THEY MAKE THE THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUNGH THEM TO POWER
Line_1565	THIS HAVE A FILAMENT AND IT DOES HAVE THERE IS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1566	IT MEANS IT RECEIVE THE ENERGY
Line_1567	AND IT MAKES LIGHT
Line_1568	THE ELECTRICITY THAT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB IS AH TO POWERING THE FILAMENT
Line_1569	BECAUSE THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1570	THE ENERGY FORM THE LIGHT BULB GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1571	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1572	THE ELECTRICITY ITS STORED IN THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT ONE SOMETHING HAD TO IT GOES OUT OF IT AND
Line_1573	IF THE POSITIVE NO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1574	THE LOWER DOTS IN THIS ENERGY FLOWING THEY TRAVELS THROUGH LIGHT THEN IT COME
Line_1575	FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1576	BLUE DOTS REPRESENT AS ENERGY
Line_1577	IT FLIPPED AROUND THEREFORE ENERGY IS FLOWING TOWARDS POSITIVE SIGN AND COMING OUT THROUGH OTHER END
Line_1578	THE LIGHT BULB GOES OFF THEN IT TURNS THEN ENERGY COMES OUT WHERE THE POSITIVE SIDE WAS
Line_1579	IF THE ENERGY FLOWS A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1580	IT IS FLOWING BEHIND IT'S FLOWING FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ITS FLOWING BACK INTO THE MAIN PART NO
Line_1581	BECAUSE THAT THE PART MINUS SIDE IS FLOWING ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1582	THERE WILL BE NO ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1583	I KNOW THAT ON THE IF ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE BOTTOM AND IT WILL LIGHT UP BUT IT'S DID BOTH ON THE BOTTOM THEY WON'T
Line_1584	WE JUST EXPERIENCE WITH
Line_1585	MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE D-CELL IS POWERING
Line_1586	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1587	RECEIVES IT
Line_1588	ENERGY MUST FLOWS THROUGH THE TO THE ENERGY
Line_1589	BECOME IN THE MOTOR IT'S THERE IS A CIRCUIT THEN
Line_1590	BATTERY HAS ENERGY SO THE WIRE IS TAKING THE ENERGY
Line_1591	THE SWITCH IS A SWITCH IN BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_1592	SWITCH IS THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL SO THAT'S WHAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL BEING GOING TO
Line_1593	YEAH THE WHOLE IS THE SWITCH
Line_1594	SWITCH CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF
Line_1595	IT TURNS THIS BATTERY THE MOTOR ON
Line_1596	ENERGY FLOW WAS STOPPING
Line_1597	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ON TO THE
Line_1598	NOTE THIS ONE THE SWITCH IS ON THE METAL IT'S WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF
Line_1599	WITHIN THEY CLOSED
Line_1600	THE AH ELECTRICITY THE SWITCH HAS TO BE BUT WHEN IT OPEN
Line_1601	THE PANEL IS IS RECEIVER BUT IT'S LIKE A BATTERY
Line_1602	THE UM RECEIVER IN A BATTERY AT THE SAME TIME ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO POWER IT THEM ONE
Line_1603	FOR THE SOLAR PANEL TO RUN TO MAKE ENERGY THE SUN HAS TO BE OUT
Line_1604	THE SUN'S KIND OF A LIKE ENERGY BUT THE ENERGY COMES DOWN AND HEATS THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1605	THE SOLAR CELL WAS STOP RUNNING
Line_1606	WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN AH IT DOESN'T CODE THE MOTOR
Line_1607	RUNNING ANYONE IN THE CIRCUIT THE MOTOR STOPS LOADED
Line_1608	IT'S STARTS IT'S STOPS WORK
Line_1609	THE MOTOR'S STICK TO RUNNING
Line_1610	BEFORE IT DOESN'T HEAT THE THE SOLAR PANEL BUT A HEATS THE WHAT YOU CALL IT
Line_1611	IS ON AH THEY PICKED THE MOTOR IS RUN
Line_1612	AND THE CANDLE WAS MELTING
Line_1613	FIRE IS STICK THE FILAMENT
Line_1614	IT GIVES OF HEAT ENERGY
Line_1615	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM YOU NEED ENERGY TO POWER EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE
Line_1616	THE ENERGY IS LIKE A FUEL
Line_1617	HOT HOT HOT HOT
Line_1618	FUEL
Line_1619	IT IS MELTING
Line_1620	THERE WAS NO SOUND
Line_1621	IT IS BURNING AND I'M WHEN IT'S GOING TO MELT IN YEARS
Line_1622	THERE IS SOUND ENERGY
Line_1623	SHE IS EATING THAT APPLE AND SHE IS WALKING
Line_1624	I CAN HEAR SOUND
Line_1625	I SEE A APPLES A CANDLE WOOD AND A FUEL CAN
Line_1626	THERE IT WILL BE
Line_1627	AN APPLE
Line_1628	BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO ENERGY
Line_1629	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TALKING
Line_1630	BECAUSE THE GAS AND COAL BURN AND THEY MAKE FIRE
Line_1631	IN A SOLAR AND A WINDMILL DON'T THEY PRODUCE IT
Line_1632	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_1633	ARE YOU MARRIED
Line_1634	IT WILL POLLUTE THE ARE YOU MARRIED
Line_1635	BECAUSE THAT GIVE US ENERGY AND ARE YOU MARRIED
Line_1636	MARINE ARE YOU MARRIED TO SOMEONE IN MY SCHOOL
Line_1637	AMAZING I JUST HAD A TEST
Line_1638	IT IS A IT FLOW A KIND OF ENERGY IN A CIRCUIT
Line_1639	ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT
Line_1640	ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH IT<SIDE
Line_1641	UM DON'T KNOW
Line_1642	IT FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1643	ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THIS ONE OTHER WIRE TAKES THE ENERGY GOES TO THE OTHER THEN IT FLOWS TO OTHER WHEN COMES TO THE OTHER ONE
Line_1644	THAT IS THE ENERGY
Line_1645	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH MAINLY RECEIVERS
Line_1646	MULTIPLE AND TONS OF ENERGY FLOWS TO OTHER COMES TO LIGHT BULBS ONE LIGHT BULB GET ANOTHER DIDN'T COME BACK
Line_1647	THREE
Line_1648	YOU NEED MORE POWER SOURCE
Line_1649	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GAINED
Line_1650	THAT THEY GET DIMMER
Line_1651	THE LIGHT BULB YOU WERE GET BRIGHTER
Line_1652	IT GIVES THE MORE ENERGY
Line_1653	IF IT ONCE IT DONE BOTH GOES OUT ONE OF THEM GOES OUT THEN YOU HAVE TO FACE ANOTHER ONE
Line_1654	BECAUSE PLUS AND PLUS ARE TOUCHING TOGETHER
Line_1655	WHEN TOUCHING ONE OF THE D-CELLS IT WILL START WORKING AGAIN
Line_1656	IF OF THE SAME SIDE ARE TOGETHER IT WON'T WORK
Line_1657	DON'T PUT BATTERIES TOGETHER ON THE SAME SIDE
Line_1658	WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT REALLY BRIGHT
Line_1659	HM THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT HAS ONE BATTERY BUT FOUR WIRE
Line_1660	HM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1661	THEY EACH OF THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1662	ALWAYS FLOWS FORWARD
Line_1663	IT IS GOOD FOR THAT I TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1664	I SEE IT GOING NO USE
Line_1665	THAT IS RIGHT
Line_1666	IT CLOSE ON WHEN IT'S DONE FALLING TO DO EVERYONE IT FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1667	HM I OBSERVED WE GOES FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
Line_1668	IT IS ITS NOT BURNING AS ITS BURNING REALLY QUICK
Line_1669	THERE IS TWO POWER RESOURCES
Line_1670	IT'S SHARING THE SAME POWER RESOURCE
Line_1671	THEY SHARING THE SAME FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_1672	YES THERE IS BUT THE BLUE EXACT GIVES US MORE ENERGY SO THAT'S WHY USUALLY BRIGHT
Line_1673	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1674	PARALLEL CIRCUIT IN THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1675	THE TOP RIGHT PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1676	HE DOES EXPERIMENT WITH ELECTROMAGNET
Line_1677	THERE IS A BODY OF MAGNET A MAGNET AND A
Line_1678	MAGNETS MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_1679	MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO ANYTHING MAY AS STEEL OR IRON
Line_1680	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1681	IT IS STICKING TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_1682	THE REFRIGERATOR IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1683	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL IN A DOOR MAGNET
Line_1684	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1685	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1686	WOOD ALUMINUM STEEL
Line_1687	USING THAT IS BECAUSE ONLY SECOND ITEMS IS NEEDED STEEL OR IRON
Line_1688	IN THE WOOD BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1689	STEEL IRON ANYTHING THAT MADE THOSE TWO MATERIAL WOULD STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1690	BECAUSE MAGNET ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL
Line_1691	I KNOW THE PORTRAY
Line_1692	THAT THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING AND ALUMINUM IS NOT BECAUSE THE STEEL IS MADE OF IRON AND THE ALUMINUM IS NOT
Line_1693	ALUMINUM IS NOT MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_1694	BECAUSE NOT ALL METALS IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL BUT IRON JUST STEEL NAIL ARE MADE BY IRON
Line_1695	IRON AND THE STEEL NAIL
Line_1696	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1697	THE STEEL NAIL HAS IRON IN IT
Line_1698	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_1699	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT OVER IT
Line_1700	THE GREY WHAT ROCK WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE THEY HAS NO IRON
Line_1701	IT HAS STEEL IN IT
Line_1702	IT HAS IRON AND STEEL IN IT
Line_1703	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL
Line_1704	STEEL
Line_1705	I THINK WE LEARNED TODAY IT HAS TO STICK TO MAGNETS IT HAS TO BE MADE OF STEEL OR
Line_1706	HOW DO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1707	A BATTERY WIRES AND THEN LIGHT BULB
Line_1708	THEY GIVE THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1709	IT'S THE SOURCE THAT GIVES US THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1710	IF THOUGH CONNECTED TO THE D-CELL THEY TRANSFER THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1711	THEY LIGHT UP IF IT HAS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1712	IT MEANS THAT IT WILL RECIEVES BUT IT WILL RECIEVES THE ENERGY FROM THE D-CELL
Line_1713	THE D-CELL IS GIVING THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1714	THE POWER COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND COMES THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1715	IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1716	IT LIGHTS UP
Line_1717	IT MOVES THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_1718	THE NEGATIVE
Line_1719	BOTH OF THE WIRE THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE SIDE
Line_1720	IT WOULDN'T GIVE IT ANY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THOUGH CAN BE ANY GOING OUT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL
Line_1721	THE LIGHT BULB NOW LEAD UP WANT TO CHANGES TO THE SIDE
Line_1722	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MOTORS AND WIRES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTOR MOVES AND WE THINK
Line_1723	THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE PART EVEN NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_1724	THE FLAG IS MOVING AND ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND ITS MOVING
Line_1725	THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1726	THOSE ARE ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT
Line_1727	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_1728	THAT IS AH THAT ITS OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IS OFF
Line_1729	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_1730	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1731	ITS IN THE CLOSE POSITION
Line_1732	NOW THE ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRAVELLING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT IS MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1733	THEY AH UMM THE SUN COME IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON THEM IT GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS
Line_1734	ITS SUNNY ALL IN THE SOLAR PANEL IS GIVING THE ELECTRICTY TO THE MOTOR
Line_1735	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
Line_1736	THE SOLAR PANEL WAS GIVING IT ELECTRICITY TO D-CELL CAN MOVE
Line_1737	THAT IT TURNS TO THE SUN SHINE UNTILL THAT JUST BEING GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS
Line_1738	I WILL NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE AT THERE WAS NO SUN ON IT MAKE A INTERVAL ELECTRICITY
Line_1739	THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING
Line_1740	IT GIVES THE SOLAR PANEL ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTOR SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTOR RUNS AND MOVES
Line_1741	IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY TO GET IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY
Line_1742	MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_1743	THE TRACK GIVING THE ELECTRICITY TO MOVE
Line_1744	IT SHOWING THAT THE D-CELL IS GIVING THE MOTOR ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_1745	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1746	I WAS A CANDLE IN ITS LAYER AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT GIVING OFF HEAT ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1747	THE WAX IS BURNING BECAUSE ITS THE CANDLE IS GIVING OFF HEAT ENERGY FROM THE FIRE
Line_1748	HEAT ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1749	LIGHT AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1750	NO IT WILL NO YOU DO NOT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THOSE AND ALL SOUND AND DUE TO A
Line_1751	GIVING OFF GIVING OFF LIGHT AND HEAT
Line_1752	THOSE SOUND ENERGY AND THERE IS ALSO FOOD ENERGY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE FOOD ENERGY TO MAKE YOUR HANDS MOVE TO DO THAT
Line_1753	IT'S MAKING SOUND IN THAT SOUND IS SOUND ENERGY SOUND ENERGY
Line_1754	FOOD ENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY
Line_1755	I SEE I GUESS CAN I SEE WOULD I SEE APPLE AND SEE MOVED IN A C CANDLE
Line_1756	IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_1757	IT'S TURNS TO EXHAUST AND EXHAUST WILL POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_1758	ONE IS LIKE A LIQUID AND ONE IS JUST LIKE A ROCK IT'S JUST SOLID
Line_1759	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_1760	THE GAS AND COALS ARE POLLUTE THAT ALSO AND ALSO PANELS IN THE WIND TURBINES WON'T
Line_1761	IT WOULDN'T POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_1762	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1763	THE D CELL IS GIVING POWER FROM THE NEGATIVE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE INTO THE WIRES MAKETHE LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1764	THE ONE D CELL CAN BE USED ABOUT MANY THINGS THAT ONE THAT ONE TIME
Line_1765	THAT THEY ALL IN THE CIRUIT AND THEY ALL DO UPON A JAM IN THE CIRUIT
Line_1766	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE D CELL AND THEN MOVES THORUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER HOOKS UP TO THE WIRES
Line_1767	IT'S FLOWING TO THE D CELL AND BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1768	THEY IT'S GOING TO FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULB WASN'T MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN COMING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1769	THAT REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FLOWING
Line_1770	IT HAS TO FLOW TO THE D CELL INTO THE BATTERIES TO TAKE THEM LIGHT I MEAN INTO THE LIGHT BULBS TO MAKE THEM LIGHT
Line_1771	FLOWS FROM IT FLOWS FROM THE D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO THE FILAMENT AND BACK TO THAT
Line_1772	ONE PATHWAY GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1773	TAKE MORE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1774	IT GETS IT GETS LESS BRIGHT
Line_1775	BECAUSE ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS YUP IT'S GREAT AND THE ELECTRIC BULB AND THAT WE THINK SO WE ARE
Line_1776	IT HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_1777	THEY BOTH ARE USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1778	THEY BOTH ARE USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1779	THE LIGHT BULBS BECOME BRIGHTER
Line_1780	WELL THE SILLY CIRCUIT IT WOULD THE LIGHT BULB SHOULD WOULD BE DIM BUT IN A THAT WAS SO GOOD THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIGHT
Line_1781	THE SERIES CIRCUITS IMPEL GOOD
Line_1782	SOME SHOWED ON PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY AND SOME HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1783	WELL THE TUBE LIGHT BULBS WERE SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ENERGY AND THEY WON'T BE AS BRIGHT THAT BY IT
Line_1784	WELL SOME SHOW THE SAME THE PATHWAY AND SOME DON'T BUT IF THEY SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY THEY WON'T BE ASKED BRIGHT
Line_1785	WELL THE FLOW THEY SHOULD THE SAME FLOW SO THEY REPELS WAS GOING TO BE AS LIGHT
Line_1786	THAT THOSE SHOWING THE SAME FLOW
Line_1787	WELL IT'S SHOWING ENERGY FROM A LIGHT BULB FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1788	IT'S FLOWING AND FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHHT BULB
Line_1789	WELL IT'S COMING OUT OF THE SIDE AND GOING BACK INTO THEIR D CELL
Line_1790	WELL THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHT THE BOTTOM ONE IS NOT SO BRIGHT AND BUT LIKE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SHOWING A PATHWAY WHAT JUST TO IT THE TOP ONES OUT
Line_1791	THE TOP ONES ON SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1792	WELL IT'S SHOWING THE SAME IT'S SHOWING THE SAME THE SAME PATHWAY SO THOUGH NOT GOING TO GET MUCH ELECTRICITY INTO THEM
Line_1793	WELL THEY BOTH HAVE TWO BATTERIES NOW AND SO HAVE ONE AND THOUGH PRETTY BRIGHT
Line_1794	AH UMM THE TOP TWO THEY WOULD BE THE BEST
Line_1795	UP ONE BECAUSE THE MORE BRIGHTER SO YOU CAN SEE BETTER
Line_1796	AH UMM SO WE DOING A PBM AND WE'RE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND HAVE IT WORKS
Line_1797	ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT HAS THAT HAD POWERS IT'S LIKE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1798	A CIRCUITS HELPS IT'S DO HELP TO ENERGY
Line_1799	ELECTRICITY IS IN A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN YOU COLLECT A BATTERY IN OTHER WIRES
Line_1800	BECAUSE ENERGY IT WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1801	THIS CIRCUIT HAS A PATHWAY WITH THE WIRE
Line_1802	IT HAS BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWAS FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND WENT TO LIGHT BULB WHEN IT COMES IN
Line_1803	IT FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY
Line_1804	SO AT THEY REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IN THEM
Line_1805	I THINK THERE ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY LITERAL ELECTRICITY
Line_1806	PUT POSITIVE SIDE INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1807	AH POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1808	WELL DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_1809	IS LESS ELECTRICITY
Line_1810	YEAH MORE THAN ONE D-CELL IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER INTO IT LOCK THEY TURNS OUT
Line_1811	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1812	IF IT DIDN'T GO WITH NEGATIVE FOR NEGATIVE THEN GOES POSITIVE FOR POSITIVE GOES NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE
Line_1813	IS THAT THE BOTH D-CELLS ARE WITH THE POSITIVE IN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WITH NEGATIVE AND THAT'S MAKE IT TURN ON
Line_1814	IT IS SPLIT THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1815	ENERGY COULD TRAVEL FROM WIRES
Line_1816	LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL LIKE IT GIVES YOU LIGHT SO THAT
Line_1817	BUT HAVE A DOING THAT EFFECT KIND OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1818	AS CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_1819	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
Line_1820	THE BOTH WIRES DID YOU
Line_1821	AND UM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH FACING WIRE AND CASING WIRE
Line_1822	THERE IS A OR PATHWAY
Line_1823	WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS WEAKER
Line_1824	THEY GET THE ENERGY IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY LIGHT
Line_1825	UM IT WILL IT WILL THE LIGHT BUL ARE SHINE AND BRIGHT STICK LIKE TAKE THAT LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
Line_1826	WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE OTHER AN ADDED IN ANOTHER BATTERY
Line_1827	I THINK THE BY EFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1828	WHEN I JUST COVERED IS ELECTRICITY IS NON FLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SHINING REALLY GREAT
Line_1829	NO
Line_1830	NOT SO GREAT
Line_1831	BUT I WAS THOSE DIFFICULT A LIKE THE ENERGY
Line_1832	HE REASON LIKE THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEM FINAL RECHARGE IN THE WIRE LIKE ITS
Line_1833	HAPPENS IS AND THE FILM WAS GO DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN AND WHAT IS ACTION
Line_1834	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FINE WHICH IS REPEAT THAT THAT REPEAT
Line_1835	CIRCUIT LIGHT IS THE SERIES AND IT ADD SUCH ONE WIRE CONNECTED
Line_1836	THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT IS SERIOUS OKAY WORKS WIRES SO AND GO GOING WHAT'S HAVE ONE WIRE AND IN THE
Line_1837	WHAT HAPPENING THIS ENERGY IS JUST WASTING ON INTO THE AIR BECAUSE THOSE NOW ELECTRICITY INTO
Line_1838	IS THERE IS NO LIGHT
Line_1839	THE CONNECTED SERIES BECAUSE A
Line_1840	IT MAY BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE A CONNECT INTO LINE THE
Line_1841	WHY DO I THINK THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THAT IS NO LIKE I MEAN
Line_1842	IT'S GOING WOW A IS THE FILAMENT THE AND OUT
Line_1843	WHAT INTO THE ELECTRICITY WENT TO THE ONE OF THE CIRCUIT WENT TO THE ITS STOPPED WORKING
Line_1844	WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THERE REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH DIFFERENT NEW ONE
Line_1845	HAVE BEEN WHEN I NOTICE ONE IS THE LIGHT BULB WILL WORK AND OTHER ONE HAS
Line_1846	BUT I NOTICE ONE LIGHT BULB THIS LIGHTING UP THIS IT IS RIGHT
Line_1847	WHAT HAPPENED THE ELECTRICITY JUST
Line_1848	THERE ARE CONNECTING CLOSE ONE AND ONE WIRE CONNECTED TO
Line_1849	WHAT THAT MIGHT BE AND WOULD THAT CONFUSE
Line_1850	WHAT HAVE GIVING IN THE WEEKS
Line_1851	THE WIRE THE ELECTRICITY THOSE THAT'S GOING IS BECAUSE AN LIGHT BULB OF OUT
Line_1852	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IS
Line_1853	IS ARE MAGNETISM
Line_1854	MAGNETS IS MAGNETISMS
Line_1855	AND NOTE FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NOT DISSOLVE
Line_1856	MAGNET ONLY TAKE TO METAL
Line_1857	THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM
Line_1858	IT HAS JUST IT KIND OF METAL IN IT
Line_1859	WHAT'S HAPPING HERE IS A MAGNETS STICKING TO A NAIL
Line_1860	IT ISSTICKING BECAUSE IT IS SAME KIND OF METAL
Line_1861	THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT
Line_1862	PAPER CLIP AND YES THAT IS
Line_1863	ONE IS STEEL WHAT THE OTHER IS IRON I GUESS
Line_1864	THE PAPER THESE ON THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK
Line_1865	HAD GET BACK TO STICK IT WILL STEEL
Line_1866	IT CONNECTED AND ITS DID
Line_1867	BECAUSE IT HAS A SAME METAL IN IT
Line_1868	IT MIGHT HAVE THE SAME THING HAS BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_1869	SORRY ABOVE MAGNETISMS
Line_1870	I THINK IT WOULD NOT CONNECT BECAUSE THE SAME QUADRANT
Line_1871	THE FORCE AND MAGNETISM IS NOT GOOD STICK TOGETHER
Line_1872	I THINK THAT BECAUSE IS SECOND PART OF IT
Line_1873	IF ITS AND IN CONNECTS IF THIS HE DOES IN AND THEN A DOES EITHER
Line_1874	WHAT IS SIMILAR IS THIS SIDES TO CONNECT
Line_1875	WOW ATTRACT AND NEST ATTRACT AND IN AND
Line_1876	WHAT'S GOING ON IS FIRST OF THE MAGNET JUST THE ONE IS LET TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE ITS START SAME IN ABSENT
Line_1877	I THINK WHAT IS ALL ABOUT IS SHE TRYING THE FINAL WAY I GUESS NORTH OR SOUTH
Line_1878	REFLECTIONS BY IF WE PUT MAGNET UNDER IT THEN
Line_1879	NOT
Line_1880	BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES PUSH BACK
Line_1881	BUT THE DIFFERENT PUSH BACK
Line_1882	LET'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND PHYSIC PAPER
Line_1883	THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CANNOT REPEL ECAH OTHER
Line_1884	ONCE IS THE MAGNET DROPPED AND THE MAGNET STICK THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONNECT TO
Line_1885	THE FORCE IS ABLE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER A MAKE MOVE UNDER STUFF
Line_1886	UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WORD PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
Line_1887	I HAVE NOTICED IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAN ONE LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER THE MAGNET CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1888	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CANNOT GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH PAPER CLIP BUT THAT'S FOR
Line_1889	WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SIX PIECE PAPERS IS THE FORCE OF THE BLUE CANNOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT IS NOW THICK AND THAT THEN BECAUSE
Line_1890	WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IS HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP IN THAT
Line_1891	UM AND IS UM IS UP TO THAT WITH THAT SIGN THING IS JUST
Line_1892	THE MAGNET IS REVERSED FROM THE NAIL AND THE NAIL LOSES ITS MAGNETISM
Line_1893	WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS ANY TIME THE MAGNET'S ON IT IT REACTS LIKE
Line_1894	GOING ON WHERE IT JUST IS THE SAME THING YOU WERE SHOWING ME LAST TIME
Line_1895	WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SEE THE SAME PICTURE
Line_1896	UM WHERE I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN ON THE PAPERCLIP
Line_1897	ALL I SEE IS A MAGNET IN A NAIL AND IT'S KEEP ON GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
Line_1898	WHEN IT'S THE MAGNET ON IT IT CAN STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP WHEN IT'S NOT IT CANNOT STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP
Line_1899	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNET DOESN'T OFF AND BECAUSE IT'S A MAGNET IT'S MAKING IT
Line_1900	IT CAN'T BECAUSE UM THE MAGNET
Line_1901	I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM
Line_1902	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT'S STICKING TO A NAIL AND CONNECTING PAPER AND IT'S
Line_1903	THE MAGNET ISN'T JUST A PAPERCLIP FROM TOP AND IT MOVES IT AROUND
Line_1904	THE FIRST WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH
Line_1905	ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
Line_1906	WHAT HAPPENING IS LIKE ANY TIME YOU'RE PRESSING IT THE WASHERS GO IN
Line_1907	AS I'M WHEN IT GOT UP AH TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO IT BROKE
Line_1908	WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHEN I PRESS SPACERS WHEN I ADD THEM THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1909	THAT TALLER PART IS TO GET THE MAGNETISM ACTUALLY IS FORCED ENOUGH
Line_1910	WELL WHAT IT DOES IT MAKES THE AH MAKES THE MAGNET TALLER THAT HELPS MAKES IT EVEN
Line_1911	THAT IT'S SPREADING APART
Line_1912	WHEN I JUST ADDED ONE WASHER IT BROKE ITS FALL BECAUSE OF THE AH BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
Line_1913	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET IS BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNET WON'T WANT TO CONNECT
Line_1914	WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER
Line_1915	SO FORCE AH THE SPACERS MAKE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
Line_1916	ON UM ONE SPACER IT TOOK NINE WASHERS TO BREAK ITS
Line_1917	UM BY ITS FORCE
Line_1918	I NEEDED THREE
Line_1919	IT GOES BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER
Line_1920	WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES THE FORCE KIND OF WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER INSTEAD OF BEING STRONG THE FORCE
Line_1921	SCIENCE
Line_1922	IT'S ALL IT'S LIKE A SAND
Line_1923	THE WIRE THE RIVET THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_1924	WHAT IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT AT THE WAY BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_1925	THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1926	THE MAGNET IT CAN ACT LIKE IT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1927	WHAT HAPPENS IS SO THE ENERGY IT GOES
Line_1928	WHAT THAT RELATES IS WHICH IS
Line_1929	WE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN CIRCUIT AND CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1930	WELL THIS ONE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCES EVEN CONNECT WITH THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT HAS NO TO THE WIRE TO GO THROUGH
Line_1931	UM THE ROLE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SO
Line_1932	THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CIRCUIT AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
Line_1933	IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1934	MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE OR THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT ON TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MAKES IT TO GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1935	WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE RIVET AND THE WIRES IS UM IT HAS TO HAVE THESE CONNECT SOMEWERE TO AT LEAST DO
Line_1936	WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET
Line_1937	UH WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUITS ALL IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT EVERYTHING
Line_1938	WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT UM UM IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS CONNECT TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
Line_1939	WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPED THE WIRE MORE AROUND THE RIVET
Line_1940	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS FORCED
Line_1941	WHAT I DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE WRAP MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT UM IT MORE UH WASHERS STICK TO IT
Line_1942	WHAT IF WHEN YOU INCREASE MORE THERE IS A
Line_1943	THE MORE UM LINES YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING MORE FORCE INTO IT
Line_1944	WHAT IT RELATES IS
Line_1945	WHEN YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND A HUNDRED WINDS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CAUSE I HAD THE TWO BATTERIES
Line_1946	UM THIS ATTACHED TO THIRTY
Line_1947	WHEN I MINUS THE LINE TO SEVEN I MEAN TEN ONES UM I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW I JUST PICKED UP FIVE
Line_1948	WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRONIC HAVE MORE BATTERIES FACING UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_1949	THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH A VARIOUS ONE D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES OR GOES UP TO
Line_1950	WHAT I SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS UM NUMBERS
Line_1951	THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1952	BY HOW THE DIFFERENT UM REFLECTIONS THERE ARE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE IT SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1953	SOMETIMES IT HURT
Line_1954	THE GUY HE FLICK THE SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHT
Line_1955	WHETHER REFLECTIVE HOW IT REACTS
Line_1956	LIKE A MIRROR CAUSE SOMETIMES REFLECT IT AND GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_1957	WHAT I KNOW IS UM CERTAIN LIGHT BULB LIGHT BRIGHTER AND SOME FOCUS IT ONE
Line_1958	THE LIGHT IT ON THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE
Line_1959	THEY BOUNCE OFF IT REFLECT TO OTHER STUFF
Line_1960	IT BOUNCES OFF IT REFLECTS TO ANOTHER THING
Line_1961	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF WHICH GIVES IT HIM SO HE CAN SEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
Line_1962	SHE'S REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO IN THE MIRROR AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WALL
Line_1963	IT'LL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR RIGHT HERE
Line_1964	THE PENCIL IS IN A CUP OF WATER
Line_1965	UH THE
Line_1966	SOLAR COMES IN UM CIRCUITS IN
Line_1967	UM CHANGING COLOR
Line_1968	GIVES OFF UM LIGHT GREEN AND UM ORANGE BUT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
Line_1969	IT'S A REFLECTION OFF OF THE LIGHT FOR IT TO A PRISM
Line_1970	IT'S THE PERSON IS CHANGING IT COLORS
Line_1971	WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
Line_1972	THE COLORS REFLECT OFF AND IT CHANGES INTO COLOR
Line_1973	SEVEN SIX
Line_1974	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL
Line_1975	TURNING INTO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_1976	FOR THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BOUNCING OFF OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE
Line_1977	UM IT'S REFLECTING OFF OF THE BLUE OR THE
Line_1978	UM STRUCTURE OF A LIGHT
Line_1979	IT IT TURNS INTO THE
Line_1980	TURNS INTO
Line_1981	SAYS THE LIGHT IS BECAUSE OF THE
Line_1982	IT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YELLOW INSTEAD OF BLUE
Line_1983	UM THE LIGHT LITTLE REFLECTS OFF THE LIGHT
Line_1984	BY HOW THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLOR
Line_1985	CHANGE THE SAME COLOR AS
Line_1986	YES THE REFLECTION THE COLOR
Line_1987	THE REFLECTION TO MIXING THE COLOR
Line_1988	UM IT WILL TURN DARK
Line_1989	UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR CAUSE IT SAYS GREEN AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
Line_1990	BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE COLOR IT'S USED TO
Line_1991	IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RED SUPPOSED TO BE RED
Line_1992	A RED
Line_1993	I AM DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_1994	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS WITH WIRES AND BATTERIES
Line_1995	TWO GREEN WIRES ONE D-CELL BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1996	BATTERY IS A RESOURCE OF ENERGY THAT STORES ELECTRICITY
Line_1997	WIRES MAKE A CIRCUIT CLOSED
Line_1998	THEY'RE TURNING OPEN CIRCUIT INTO A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1999	THAT THEY CONDUCT SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY TO TO THE BATTERY
Line_2000	I THINK ELECTRICITY TRAVELS
Line_2001	WIRES CARRY OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2002	LIGHT BULBS HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2003	A LIGHT BULB HAS A
Line_2004	I THINK IT MEANS FOR A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER THAT IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY TO LIGHT UP THE
Line_2005	THAT THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRE OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2006	I I SEE ELECTRICITY
Line_2007	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT
Line_2008	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2009	THAT END OF THE BATTERY IS FLOWING TO THE CIRCUIT WIRE OF THE LIGHT
Line_2010	THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB GOING TOWARDS THE THE D-CELL BATTERY
Line_2011	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_2012	THE D CELL BATTERY FLIPPED OVER
Line_2013	ITS GOES
Line_2014	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING AROUND THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THAT BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_2015	THE WIRE HAS TOUCHING THE CASE THING WIRES SO THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP INTO THE FLOW
Line_2016	I THINK THE BULB WOULDN'T LIGHT IF YOU TOUCH THE BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE BASE
Line_2017	THAT WHEN EVERY TIME THOUGH THE WIRE TOUCHES JUST CASING WIRE THE BULB LIGHTS I MEAN BOTH OF THE WIRES TOUCH INTO BASE IT DOESN'T
Line_2018	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE
Line_2019	OR THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THERE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2020	THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE
Line_2021	THE BATTERY GIVES THE MOTOR ENERGY AND MAKES THE MOTOR
Line_2022	IT HAS TO SWITCH MAKING THE MOTOR STOP
Line_2023	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSE BUT ITS
Line_2024	IT CONNECTS TO THE WIRES MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_2025	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_2026	THE MOTOR IS ON AND MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2027	THE CLOSER COULD BE COMES
Line_2028	THE SWITCH HAS JUST TOUCH THE WIRE
Line_2029	THE MOTOR STOPS AND MOVE
Line_2030	THE SWITCHES ON AND THAT CLOSE
Line_2031	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CLOSE TO WIRE TO THE BATTERY AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_2032	WHEN THEY GET SOLAR ENERGY THE POWER SO
Line_2033	SO AND THAT IS TRAVELING TO THE SOLAR PANEL INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2034	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKE IT SPIN
Line_2035	THE SOLAR PANEL IS RECEIVING SUNLIGHT
Line_2036	THE FLAG WAS STOP SPINNING
Line_2037	WHEN I CLICK ON THE CERTAIN OF FLAGS THAT SPINNING AGAIN
Line_2038	THE SOLAR PANEL IS NOT RECEIVING ANY ENERGY AND ITS STOP THE MOTOR FOR SPIN
Line_2039	IT IS SHOWING ENERGY TRANSPARENT FROM THE WIRE TO THIS MOTOR
Line_2040	I'M DOING FINE AND YOU
Line_2041	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO BUILD PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2042	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2043	THERE IS TWO BLACK BULBS WITH POWERED BY ONE D CELL BATTERY
Line_2044	THERE IS TWO PATH WAYS
Line_2045	THE LIGHT BULB BUT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_2046	HMMM
Line_2047	CUPS AND COMES
Line_2048	THAT GO TO GO TO GO TO
Line_2049	I DON'T GET WHAT DONE
Line_2050	ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2051	I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS TWO PATH WAY
Line_2052	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS GETTING
Line_2053	UPON ON THOUGH COULD THOSE CIRCUIT TO PUT INTO THAT AND THE SERIES AND KIND OF
Line_2054	BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE LIGHT BULB HAS TO STOP LIKE GO AND ITS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB GET DIMMER
Line_2055	THE WIRES HAVE TO DO ENERGY HAS TO TRAVEL LONGER THAN IT WAS TO
Line_2056	WELL BATTERIES
Line_2057	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT THAT HAVE TO FLOW THAT
Line_2058	I'M DOING FINE
Line_2059	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING TO SOLVE THE SWING JUST LIKE ITS BULB
Line_2060	THE
Line_2061	THE BULB IS NOT LIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2062	WHILE CHECK THE BATTERY
Line_2063	GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TURNOFF
Line_2064	THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_2065	BECAUSE IN THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT NO MORE ENERGY YOU CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEY BOTH THOUGH
Line_2066	I DON'T GET OVER TALKING YOU
Line_2067	THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND NO MORE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER
Line_2068	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_2069	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2070	THE OTHER BULBS STATES LIKE THEY BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IS CONNECTED TO OTHERS
Line_2071	THE OTHER BULB STATES IT LAY
Line_2072	ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUTS THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_2073	BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AND WHEN THE OTHER BULB LET BURNED OUT THE OTHER BULB
Line_2074	BLAB BLAB BLAB
Line_2075	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW MAGNET INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
Line_2076	THE TWO BRICK MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO
Line_2077	I THINK THE MAGNETS WHAT ARE THEY REPEL AND THERE WAS ATTRACT
Line_2078	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_2079	OPPOSITE POLES ARE ATTRACT AND A MATCHING PAIRS DON'T KNOW
Line_2080	MOST OF THE MAGNETS HAVE SOUTH SIDE THAT ARE PRESENTED TO
Line_2081	THE OPPOSITE POLES
Line_2082	THE COMPOSITE IS WAITING MODEL AND THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2083	I AM DOING FINE THANK YOU
Line_2084	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2085	MAGNETIC FIELD IS SOMETHING THAT INVISIBLE AND WE CANNOT SEE
Line_2086	MAGNETISM WORKS BY BLA BLA BLA AND THAT WOULD BE WANT TO
Line_2087	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_2088	THE MAGNET WILL ONLY GOES TO THE PIECE OF PAPER AND ALL TO THE
Line_2089	NO ITS NOT
Line_2090	THE MAGNET IS INTERACTING WITH THE NAIL AND THEN ALL IN THE PAPER CLIPS STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_2091	THE MAGNET IS INTERACTING WITH THE NAIL AND ALL THE MAGNETISM TO BRING THROUGH THE NAILS STICK TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2092	BECAUSE
Line_2093	LIKE THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T RUN THROUGH THE NAIL AND
Line_2094	PROBABLY A FEW SECONDS
Line_2095	THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETISM AND LET THE WOODEN STICK TO
Line_2096	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS BEEN MOVED FROM THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP WAS
Line_2097	IT'S SHOWING ME HOW THE MAGNETISM RUNS TO THE NAIL
Line_2098	WE HAVE TWO
Line_2099	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNET AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2100	YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT AROUND THE
Line_2101	AND ALSO WORKS BY THE WRAPPING AROUND THE MAGNET
Line_2102	THE RIVET IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE SWITCHES ALL MAKING IT A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO IT IS AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2103	THE WIRES IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2104	WHEN YOU TURN ON
Line_2105	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE RIVET AND
Line_2106	ARE YOU A BIG
Line_2107	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE AND GOES INTO THE RIVET
Line_2108	THE RIVET IS GETTING THAT ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY AND IS IT GO PASS THROUGH
Line_2109	THE RIVET BECOMES MAGNETIZED AND MIX UP THE WATER
Line_2110	WON'T CONSIDER THAT WOULD BE
Line_2111	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT TRAVELS
Line_2112	UH THE LIGHT BULB IS TURNING ON AND THE UH BOY IS
Line_2113	THE EYE REFLECTS THE LIGHT AND IT
Line_2114	THE LIGHT TRAVEL WITH DIFFERENT AREA HOW HOW FAR
Line_2115	IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT GOES TO THE MIRRORS
Line_2116	THE LIGHT BOUNCES OFF THE OBJECT
Line_2117	IT BOUNCES OFF THE
Line_2118	THE UGLY BOY IS SEEING HIS REFLECTION
Line_2119	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO IS REFLECTING INTO
Line_2120	A REFLECTION MAKES THE THE LIGHT TRAVEL THROUGH THE MIRRORS AND THEN IT HITS THE STAR AND THE LIGHTS
Line_2121	THE LIGHT GETS REFLECTED OFF THE MIRROR AND THE MIRROR MAKES THE LIGHT
Line_2122	THE THE REFLECTION OF THE WATER IS GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S TWO PENCILS
Line_2123	THE WATER REFLECTS THE PENCIL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO OF THEM
Line_2124	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REFLECTIONS AND HOW THE LIGHT REFLECTS OUT OF MIRRORS
Line_2125	I AM COLD AND WEAK TODAY THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNI
Line_2126	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS AND HOW THEY
Line_2127	THEY ALL
Line_2128	THE LIGHT IS SHINING TO A DIRECTION
Line_2129	I AM WEAK AND SICK THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNI
Line_2130	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS AND HOW
Line_2131	I AM COLD AND WEAK THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNI
Line_2132	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COLORS
Line_2133	THE LIGHT IS ALL YELLOW AND IT'S MAKING ENERGY OUT OF IT
Line_2134	THE WHITE LIGHT CAN COME FROM THE SUN NO
Line_2135	I CAN SEE THREE SOURCES OF WHITE LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2136	THE LIGHT IS SHINING INTO THE PRISM AND THE PRISM IS GONNA SEPARATING THE THE LIGHT THE WHITE LIGHT INTO IT'S
Line_2137	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE WHITE LIGHT INTO IT'S DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_2138	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE WHITE LIGHT INTO IT'S ORIGINAL COLORS
Line_2139	THROUGH THE PRISM AND THE PRISM SEPARATES THE COLORS IF IT'S REAL
Line_2140	I SEE ALL SEVEN COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2141	IT MAKES SEVEN COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2142	I THINK THERE ARE SEVEN COLORS
Line_2143	THE WHITE LIGHT IS GETTING ABSORBED TO THE WHITE PART OF THE BALL AND THE THE REST OF THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT
Line_2144	BECAUSE THE BALL IS BOUNCING
Line_2145	THE WHITE LIGHT GETS TURNED INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE WHITE PART OF THE BALL GETS ABSORBED
Line_2146	THE WHITE LIGHT IS GETTING ABSORBED BY THE WHITE PART OF THE BALL AND THE REST OF THE BLUE PART OF THE BALL IS GETTING
Line_2147	QUE TE PASA MARNI QUE TE PASA
Line_2148	THE WHITE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE AND THAT MAKES THE BALL BLUE AND THE WHITE PART STAYS WHITE
Line_2149	THE WHITE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE YELLOW BALL AND IS MAKING THE BALL
Line_2150	BALLS ARE BORING TO PLAY WITH THE BALL IS MAKING IT YELLOW BECAUSE THE WHITE IS PISSING ON IT
Line_2151	BALL MAKES YELLOW AND THEN BALL MAKES IT WHITE BECAUSE OF WHITE SPOT AND YELLOW
Line_2152	THE PLATFORM IS TURNING ONTO BREAD AND BREAD IT TURNING INTO WHITE
Line_2153	THE BALL TURNS GREEN
Line_2154	THE BALL TURNED GREEN BECAUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT MAKES THE BLUE FILTER INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE YELLOW BALL
Line_2155	ONLY THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE THE LEMON
Line_2156	THE LIGHT ISN'T REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND THE LIGHT IS TURNING
Line_2157	WHEN YOU SHINE THE LIGHT ON THE BRICK IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2158	YOU WOULD SHINE A RED LIGHT ON IT
Line_2159	WE CALL THEM A D CELL BATTERY A BATTERY AND THEN ENERGY REQUIRED
Line_2160	BATTERIES AAPRODUCE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS POWER AND MOVE
Line_2161	THE WIRES AND THE CIRCUIT TRAVEL ENERGY THROUGH THEM TO GIVE POWER TO AN OBJECT THAT IT IS TOUCHING
Line_2162	IN A CIRCUIT WIRES CARRY ENERGY
Line_2163	SO THE BATTERY GETS IT POWER AND THE LIGHT SO THE BATTERY IS LIKE A LIGHT
Line_2164	RECEIVER MEANS IS GETTING AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING FROM ANYTHING
Line_2165	SOME WAY IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND ITS TRAVELLING TO THE LIGHT FROM A WIRE BECAUSE OF ELECTRICITY WIRE
Line_2166	THE NEGATIVE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2167	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENTS ENERGY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2168	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2169	I NOTICED THAT THE ENERGY IS STARTED TO GO THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS CLOCKWISE
Line_2170	THE DIRECTION OF FLOW TO ENTER THE OTHER WAY
Line_2171	IT IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2172	I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS WRECKING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_2173	I THINK THAT THE ENERGY WOULD GO JUST GO NO WHERE AND THEY WOULD STOP IN A LIGHT BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT
Line_2174	I NOTICED THAT FIRST THE BULB THAT NOT LIGHT AND WHEN WE CLICKED IN THE WITH THE WIRE MOVES AND IT THE LIGHT BULB DID
Line_2175	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE DONE I AM DOING CLOSED CIRCUITS AND OPEN CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2176	IT MOVE IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THAT IT MEANS TO MOVE
Line_2177	IT MUST GET ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY SO THAT IT WILL MOVE
Line_2178	THAT IT MUST GET ENERGY SO IT MOVES
Line_2179	THE BATTERY IS TRANSFERRING ITS ENERGY AND THEN IT MOVES SO THAT
Line_2180	NOTICED THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT PUTTING THE OTHER WIRE SO IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY JUST STOPS SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_2181	YOU SAID THAT THERE IS ENERGY TRAVELLING FROM BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY SO IT TRAVELS UP
Line_2182	I NOTICED THAT I DON'T
Line_2183	IT HAS TO HAVE LIGHT FROM THE SUN SO THAT IT WILL MOVE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NOT LIGHT IT HAS NO ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_2184	FLAG IS TURNING IT MEANS THAT IT IS GIVING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR PANEL AND THE SOLAR PANEL GET ITS ENERGIES FROM THE SUN AND ENERGIES LIKE MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2185	I THINK IT IS ONE POINT BECAUSE IT IS SAVING
Line_2186	THINKING IT CAN STILL PRODUCE ENERGY ON A CLOUDY DAY I JUST THINK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS ON BRIGHT AND SUNNY DAY
Line_2187	THE FLAG WAS START TO MOVE BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR CELL AND THE ENERGIES MOVES THEN I GOES
Line_2188	MAKES THE FLAG MOVE HA WOW WOW WOW WOW
Line_2189	START WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THAT THE FLAG WILL NOT MOVE
Line_2190	THAT THERE IS NO ENERGY TRAVELLING FROM THE D-CELL THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN BLABLA BLABLABLA
Line_2191	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS INSULATORS AND SOUNDS LIKE THAT
Line_2192	HAVING CONDUCTORS HELPS SEND ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR SO THEN IS ABLE TO SPEND THE FLY GRAM
Line_2193	IN A CIRCUIT A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO POWER A MOTOR
Line_2194	CONDUCTORS ARE WORK CONDUCT ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE SO THEN AGAINST THE MOTOR POWER JUST BEEN
Line_2195	GOOD
Line_2196	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_2197	FOUND OUT THAT THE BRASS RING WORKS
Line_2198	WITH AN INSULATOR IN IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THAT IN AN INSULATOR WILL NOT LET ENERGY FLOW THROUGH WHAT TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_2199	LET START THUS PAPER CLIP IS A CONDUCTOR AND ENERGY CAN IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_2200	CONDUCTORS ARE OBJECT THAT ARE ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THEM WITH AND THE MOTOR WILL STILL SPIN IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER WIRE
Line_2201	WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT PRESENT ENERGY
Line_2202	BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO MAKE STUFF
Line_2203	I DON'T KNOW WHAT FUELS ARE
Line_2204	A CANDLE IT'S ON FIRE AND IT RELATES TO ENERGY BECAUSE IF ENERGY
Line_2205	OBSERVE WHEN I SEE IT KIND OF BURNS I
Line_2206	BURNING CANDLE GIVES OFF ENERGY
Line_2207	NO I DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING WHEN A CANDLE BURN
Line_2208	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER BECAUSE IT IS FUEL AND IT IS GETTING USED
Line_2209	YOU CAN SEE HEAT OR YOU COULD FEEL HEAT
Line_2210	ENERGY IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEY ARE USING THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR BODY TO PAT THE DRUM
Line_2211	SHE IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE'S GETTING ENERGY FROM HER APPLE AND THEN SHE IS USING ENERGY ON HER WALK
Line_2212	YES YOU CAN HEAR THE DRUMS BEING PLAYED BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INSTRUMENT AND THEY ARE MADE TO MAKE NOISE
Line_2213	I SEE A LOT OF SOURCES OF ENERGY
Line_2214	I SEE SOLAR PANELS APPLES BARK TREE PIECES COAL AND FUEL
Line_2215	THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BAD BECAUSE WE ARE RELEASING BAD GASES INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2216	WE IT MAKES THE AIR ALL IT IT GIVES OFF BAD GASES TO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2217	IT IS ALL DARK AND SMOKEY
Line_2218	I SEE DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES I SEE GOOD ONES AND BAD ONE
Line_2219	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT UM LEAVING BAD GASES IN THE AIR
Line_2220	THEY BOTH PRODUCE ENERGY AND THEY DO NOT AND NEITHER OF THEM PRODUCE BAD GASES INTO THE AIR
Line_2221	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO LEAVE BAD GASES IN THE AIR AND THEY THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES
Line_2222	I THINK THAT COAL AND GAS WILL ONE DAY RUN OUT AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANYMORE LEFT TO USE
Line_2223	THEY WILL HAVE BAD BAD EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY POLLUTE BAD GASES INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2224	NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ONE DAY THAT WE ONLY HAVE THEM NOW
Line_2225	I AM DOING GOOD
Line_2226	WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2227	ELECTRICITY CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_2228	FOR THE BOTH TO LIGHT THE THE WIRES AT LETTING ENERGY FROM THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE GO INTO THE THEY ARE LIGHT BULB
Line_2229	STILL GET ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE OF THE LIGHT BULB WHERE THE D-CELL SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_2230	UM IT IS JUST GIVING ENERGY AND TRAVELS LIKE A PASS WAY AND THEN I DON'T KNOW
Line_2231	UM YEAH YEAH BUT
Line_2232	IN A SERIES CIRCUIT PATHWAYS THEY CAN BE AS MANY AS TWO UP TO IS AS MANY AS MILLION
Line_2233	AND MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULB WAS WILL GET DIMMER
Line_2234	D-CELL THROUGH SERIES CIRCUIT A LIGHT BULB LIGHTEN NOW WE BRIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY
Line_2235	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUILD WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2236	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE UM THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_2237	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE D-CELL BATTERY
Line_2238	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS
Line_2239	I OBSERVE ENERGY IS MOVING
Line_2240	COMPARE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE BRIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT
Line_2241	BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING MORE ELECTRONS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D-CELL BECAUSE THAT IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D-CELL YOU WILL GET MORE DUE
Line_2242	I'M WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2243	I REMEMBER THAT IS ALWAYS GOES LIKE IN ONE SIDE AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2244	IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PATH THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS OR MORE IT MATTERS HOW MANY LIKE WILL
Line_2245	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLVING CAPITALIZED
Line_2246	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE STRINGS JUST LIKE
Line_2247	I'M TO USE UM YOU CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS METAL
Line_2248	UM YOU CAN USE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WILL THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT THAT CAN COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_2249	BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING TO THAT LIKE LIGHT BULB SO IT DOESN'T KEEP FLOWING
Line_2250	THE LIGHT BULB THAT IS BROKEN THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO THE ENERGY CANNOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_2251	THE ENERGY STOPS RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BROKE SO THE ENERGY CANNOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT
Line_2252	AND SO THE FILAMENT BREAKS ON ONE OF EITHER OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2253	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2254	WE HAVE ALSO SEEN WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL
Line_2255	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_2256	AND HM ONLY A NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE STICK TOGETHER
Line_2257	I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_2258	THE NAIL OR THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE NAIL BECAUSE THE NAIL IS IRON
Line_2259	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET OR THE NAIL IS STEEL OR IRON SO THE MAGNET ATTRACTS IT
Line_2260	ONLY IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY METALS AND STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2261	MAGNETS STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEEL
Line_2262	A NAIL MUST MUST BE MADE OF ALUMINUM
Line_2263	ITS BECAUSE THE MAGNETS ONLY ATTRACTS OR AND KIND OF METALS AND THE OTHER NAIL MUST BE ALUMINUM SO IT'S IS NOT ATTRACTING TO THE MAGNET
Line_2264	IT IS HM STEEL OR IRON THAT WILL HM ATTRACT TO EACH THE MAGNET
Line_2265	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_2266	I THINK THAT THE STEEL WAS STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE ALUMINUM IS LIKE NOT AS JUST A STRONG
Line_2267	I NOTICED THAT ONLY USUALLY THE METALS ON OR OBJECTS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2268	I THINK IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_2269	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2270	IT IS STICK
Line_2271	I THINK THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE HM THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2272	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS INTERACT
Line_2273	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER TWO NORTH POLES OR SOUTH POLES FACING EACH OTHER
Line_2274	THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO SOUTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO NORTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_2275	THEY HM LIKE RUN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2276	LIKE THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND PUSHING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2277	I THINK THIS PICTURE IS THE
Line_2278	SHE IS TRYING TO SEE WHICH DIRECTION SHE IS GOING
Line_2279	BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MAKE THAT THE COMPASS NOW WHAT WAY THEY ARE FACING
Line_2280	IT IS BECAUSE THE LIKE
Line_2281	THE NAIL IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_2282	OH YOU WAS RECORDING ME
Line_2283	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC FORCE OF MAGNETS
Line_2284	THE MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
Line_2285	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS WEAKER
Line_2286	THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER
Line_2287	THEY DO NOT HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH FORCE TO ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO FAR APART
Line_2288	THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT YOU NEED GETS SMALLER
Line_2289	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2290	AN ELECTROMAGNET IS A MAGNET THAT HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_2291	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2292	I NOTICED THAT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IT INCLUDES THE SWITCH BUT IT ALSO HAS A D CELL TO HAVE ENERGY
Line_2293	WITHOUT THE ENERGY THEN IT WILL NOT BE AN ELECTROMAGNET MAGNET AND THE RIVET WILL NOT ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_2294	YOU NOTICED THAT THE ENERGY STOPS ARM AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2295	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THAN THE ENERGY WILL JUST STOP
Line_2296	AND THE ENERGY STOPS AND AM THAT THE MAGNET IS NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT ANYTHING ANYMORE
Line_2297	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS BECAUSE THERE IS NO REFRIGERATOR ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_2298	YOU CONSIDER THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS GIVING AMENERGY TO THE MAGNET TO ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2299	I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO THAT IT CAN ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2300	GOOD GOOD
Line_2301	THAT IS IT ISN'T A COMBINATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNET
Line_2302	UM YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRING AROUND THE MAGNET TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2303	THE UM THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND IT UM ATTRACTS THE WASHERS
Line_2304	IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2305	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE ELECTROMAGNET IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2306	YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS NO WASHERS ATTACHING BECAUSE UM IT IS NOT IN A A CLOSED
Line_2307	IT DOES BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2308	YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE BOTTOM THAT IT HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND TO THE RIVET
Line_2309	UM IF YOU ADD MORE WIRE WRAP YOU ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2310	CHANGES BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING AROUND THE RIVET AND IT IS GETTING MORE ENERGY SO IT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2311	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT TRAVELS
Line_2312	BECAUSE IT THIS LIGHT IS UM REFLECTING
Line_2313	YOU CAN'T IT REFLECTS IT CAN REFLECT AND KEEP AND CAN REFLECT ONTO SOMETHING
Line_2314	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF AND RAYS REFLECTING
Line_2315	UM WITHOUT IT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DARK
Line_2316	IT UM REFLECTS OFF OF UM SOME THINGS BUT SOME THINGS IT CAN NOT REFLECT AS WELL
Line_2317	IT REFLECTS OFF THE OBJECTS THAT IT HITS IN THE ROOM
Line_2318	YOU OBSERVE UM THE LIGHT REFLECT
Line_2319	CAUSE UM THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING AND IT IS UM BOUNCING BACK AT THE THE STUDENT
Line_2320	CAN KEEP REFLECTING IF IT IS POSITIONED RIGHT AND UM THE LIGHT IS STRONG ENOUGH
Line_2321	I THINK THE FLASHLIGHT WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LEFT IN THE CORNER STAR BECAUSE OF HOW
Line_2322	A UM PENCIL IS REFLECTING BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENCILS IN THE WATER BUT THERE REALLY IS ONLY ONE
Line_2323	YOU NOTICE THAT UM THE PENCIL REFLECTS OFF THE GLASS
Line_2324	AND THE UM GLASS WITH WATER IN IT IT IS REFLECTING IN THE WITH THE GLASS WITH AIR NOTHING IS HAPPENING
Line_2325	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW UM LIGHT IS UM CAN SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2326	IT CAN COME FROM ENERGY
Line_2327	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE WHITE LIGHT MAKES THE CANDLE GREEN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE ANY COLOR
Line_2328	YOU NOTICE THAT UM THE PRISM SPLITS THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE LIGHT INTO DIFFERENT UM FORMS
Line_2329	SEE THAT THE PRISM SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE LIGHT
Line_2330	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT IS SPLITS INTO SIX DIFFERENT COLORS AND IT IS THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2331	CAN NOTICE THAT UM IN THE LIGHT BULB ALL THE COLORS ARE WHITE AND WHEN IT SPLITS INTO THE PRISM IT SPLITS INTO DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_2332	I THINK THAT SIX DIFFERENT COLORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE LIGHT
Line_2333	YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS UM GOING TOWARDS THE BALL THAT IT IS WHITE LIGHT AND WHEN IT REFLECTS THE BALL THE LIGHT IS BLUE THAT REFLECTS
Line_2334	UM THAT EVERY COLOR IS WHITE IS ATTRACTING TO THE YELLOW BALL AND YELLOW IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL
Line_2335	THAT UM THE WHITE LIGHT IS ATTRACTING THE BALL AND UM THE YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE YELLOW BALL
Line_2336	UM YOU NOTICE THAT WHITE UM HITTING THE BALL AND YELLOW LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF OF THE
Line_2337	THAT UM THE BLUE BALL BLUE LIGHT WOULD REFLECT IT AND ON THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
Line_2338	YOU NOTICE THAT UM DIFFERENT OBJECTS CAN TURN INTO DIFFERENT COLORS DEPENDING ON WHICH COLOR THE OBJECT IS
Line_2339	UM THE YELLOW BALL CHANGES INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE UM DIFFERENT LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS
Line_2340	COLOR CHANGED AND IF IT IS UM A DIFFERENT UM OBJECT THEN IT WILL NOT CHANGE INTO THAT COLOR IF IT IS UM A CERTAIN COLOR OBJECT
Line_2341	YOU THINK THAT ONLY SOME UM COLORS LIGHT WILL CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE LIME
Line_2342	CAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE UM EVERY OTHER COLOR BESIDES GREEN UM TO TURN THE LIGHT GREEN
Line_2343	THE COLOR RED BECAUSE UM THE BRICK IS RED
Line_2344	UM IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM IT DOES NOT NEED THAT COLOR
Line_2345	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A SCIENCE ENERGY
Line_2346	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_2347	D-CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_2348	ARE THE WIRES COULD CONNECT THROUGH THE LIGHT I MEAN SO A LIGHT BULB AND A SHINE WITH THE BATTERY
Line_2349	WIRE PATHWAY
Line_2350	THE BATTERIES HAVE ENERGY AND THEM FOR THEY COULD MAKE THINGS WORK
Line_2351	YOU COULD LIGHT OF ANY
Line_2352	THE SOURCE COULD GET ENERGY
Line_2353	THE PATHWAY OF THING
Line_2354	THINGS THEY COULD CARRIES IN
Line_2355	LIGHT BULBS COULD MAKE ANYTHING SHINE
Line_2356	IT MEANS THAT IF YOU LIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING
Line_2357	YOU COULD PUT A SOME OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT AND THE BATTERY TO MAKE IT SHINE
Line_2358	I SEE AND THE WIRES ARE ATTRACTING THE LIGHT BULB AND ABOUT THESE ARE THE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2359	UM ENERGY FROMS THE BATTERY IS GO TO THE LIGHT BULB TOWARD
Line_2360	IF YOU USE D-CELL ENERGY UM WITH THE WIRES THE WIRES WILL GET ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2361	ON THE POSITIVE SIDE UM GETS THE ENERGY AND IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM GIVES THE ENERGY TO LIGHT BULB
Line_2362	THE POSITIVE AH THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE WIRE
Line_2363	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENTS ALL THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2364	FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDES TO GO TO A NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2365	ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND ONE OF THE WIRE IT IS WITH THE POSITIVE
Line_2366	ONLY POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2367	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE UM ONE WIRE A ONE WIRE HAS BECOME CONNECTED TO THE
Line_2368	THEY WON'T WORK GIVE THEY DON'T THE BASE BUT IF THERE ON THE OTHER SIDES THEY WOULD WORK
Line_2369	IT MEANS THAT'S THE FLOW
Line_2370	ENERGY HAS FLOW TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2371	UM ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2372	IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2373	THE MOTOR WORKS
Line_2374	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2375	WHEN IT'S OPEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T MOVE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_2376	IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_2377	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2378	THE SUN UM HEATS THE SOLAR PANELS AND THERE IS SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY TO WORK
Line_2379	THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING SO THERE IS A CLOSE CIRCUIT
Line_2380	AH BECAUSE THE ENERGY GOES
Line_2381	THE FLAG WOULD MOVE BECAUSE THE SOLAR PANELS NEED SUN LIGHT WORK
Line_2382	THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2383	AND THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_2384	THE MOTOR WILL WORK BECAUSE OF THE SUN
Line_2385	THE SOLAR PANELS ARE ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_2386	ARE CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH
Line_2387	THERE IS A BATTERY WIRES AND MOTOR ARE NOW AND THE SWITCH
Line_2388	THE SWITCH AND THE NAIL
Line_2389	LASER PAPER CLIP THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_2390	WAS THIS SPONGE IT WON'T WORK
Line_2391	SOME OF THING MADE THE COPPER IRON
Line_2392	SOME OF THEM ARE
Line_2393	THE MOTOR ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE THE STICK IS WOOD
Line_2394	IT HAS IN CLOSED CIRCUIT PART IT HAS WOOD BUT NOT STEEL OR IRON
Line_2395	IT WILL WORK BECAUSE IT'S RUBBER
Line_2396	UM IT IS NOT AH LIKE THE OTHERS
Line_2397	BECAUSE THE STRAW IS RUBBER
Line_2398	TO BRASS RING RING THERE IS WORK BECAUSE IT'S LIKE COPPER AND COPPER LIGHT METAL
Line_2399	THE CIRCUITS STOPS THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_2400	RECEIVE ENERGY UM WE WON'T LIVE
Line_2401	IT CAN DO
Line_2402	THE CANDLE HAS ENERGY FROM THE FIRE THERE IS
Line_2403	YES IT WAS HOT
Line_2404	ENERGY ENERGY
Line_2405	SO ENERGY IS AH LIKE THE SOURCE
Line_2406	YES I HEAR LIGHT SO
Line_2407	IT STARTED TO FLAME UP
Line_2408	I COULD SEE AH
Line_2409	YOU GET ENERGY BY HITTING THE DRUM
Line_2410	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE
Line_2411	I SEE ENERGY GOING TO OPPOSE THE CANDLE THE WATER AND THE GASOLINE
Line_2412	AND THE AIR IS GETTING THIRD YEAR YEAH
Line_2413	AND YEAH
Line_2414	ARE THE SOLAR PANELS ARE GETTING ENERGY AND THERE FROM THE ROCK IS GOING TO THE WATER AND THEN THE WATERS WERE
Line_2415	AND THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ENERGY AND ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ENERGY LIKE CAR YEAH
Line_2416	REALLY WANT TO KNOW
Line_2417	UM CARS AND TRAINS USE GAS AND A COAL TO WORK
Line_2418	I WOULD BURN AND THEN IT WOULD GET A FRANKY AND DIDN'T BLA
Line_2419	COLOR LESS TRAYS
Line_2420	EVERY ONE BIRTH BECAUSE RECEIVE ENERGY WILL ALL TIME
Line_2421	WHICH IS A THINGS ARE GO TO GET THERE ITS MAKE SOMETHING WORK WITH ENERGY
Line_2422	ENERGY HAS GO TO LIGHT BULB FROM THE D-CELL BUT
Line_2423	UM D-CELL HAS ENERGY THAT GO TO THE POSITIVE SIDES AROUND
Line_2424	WHICH GOING END FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT TO NEGATIVE SIDE AND GOING IN THAT TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_2425	THOSE ARE THE ENERGY SOURCE
Line_2426	THE MOVING DOTS ARE ENERGY THAT GOES INTO LIGHT BULB AND HENCE THROUGH THE WIRES AND
Line_2427	OTHER FROM THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN FOR
Line_2428	IT CLOSE AH THE BECAUSE
Line_2429	THERE WAS THREE FROM THE WIRES ITS DEPENDS ON THE ONE
Line_2430	I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WILL BE THE MUCH BRIGHT
Line_2431	THE LIGHT BULBS WELL AND SHINE NOT MUCH ANYMORE
Line_2432	THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH LIGHT AND THEN SO THERE WOULD BE SO BRIGHT
Line_2433	AT WHICH TWO D-CELLS THE BATTERY THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER AND WITH ONE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE DARK BRIGHT
Line_2434	THE NEEDS TO BE A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE A TWO BULB ALLOWS
Line_2435	SOME LATER
Line_2436	A WE WERE DOING A P-BELL ON SOLAR PANELS AND HOUSING WORK
Line_2437	THERE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2438	IT SHARES IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_2439	THEY ARE A PARALLEL SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2440	THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEY SHARE ENERGY AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT DO NOTHING THEY NOT SHARE
Line_2441	PARALLEL AND SERIES
Line_2442	THAT THEY ARE PARALLEL CIRCUITS YEAH YEAH
Line_2443	THAT-THE LIGHT BULBS GOOD FOR NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY
Line_2444	UM THEY ARE
Line_2445	IT IS A PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_2446	THEY PROVISIONS IN THE POSITIVE SIDE BUT NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2447	YES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS BURNING OUT BECAUSE THEY HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND ANOTHER THEY ONCE FAILED
Line_2448	LET'S THE POINT
Line_2449	THE PARALLEL
Line_2450	GOOD
Line_2451	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE LET DOING A ON AH SCIENCE
Line_2452	BECAUSE IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2453	IT WORKS BECAUSE AND WHEN YOU TOOK CLOSE CIRCUIT
Line_2454	SPRINGS ARE LIGHTS ARE
Line_2455	A SERIES CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSE WHERE WOULD WORK
Line_2456	THAT LIGHT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_2457	ONE OF
Line_2458	THE ENERGY DOESN'T AND GO IT DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB ANYMORE
Line_2459	IT WILL
Line_2460	IT IS NONE IT IS A STORE CLOSE OKAY
Line_2461	I NOTICED THEN SOME OF THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BREAKING BECAUSE THERE SHARING ENERGY
Line_2462	UM YEAH IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT FLOW
Line_2463	THAT AND THE FIRST ONE ITS UM IT CLOSE HOW WILL BREAKES AND THE SECOND ONE SHOWS HOW IT SHOWS
Line_2464	IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE UM IF THE ONE OF THEM IS BROKEN THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL WORK BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS IN FLOW THROUGH
Line_2465	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB AND IS THE ONE THAT GIVES
Line_2466	SEE YOU NEXT TIME LEARNING
Line_2467	THEY ARE MAGNET
Line_2468	REGULATOR
Line_2469	IT COULD
Line_2470	ALL THE MAGNETS AS TAKE TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_2471	MAGNETS COULD STICK ON TO ANYTHING THAT'S IS
Line_2472	WE CARE ATTRACT TO ANOTHER MAGNETS OR ELSE STEEL
Line_2473	WHY HIGH
Line_2474	THE MAGNET IS STICK TO IS ATTRACTING TO THE NAIL
Line_2475	WHY IT IS TAKEN TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL OR OTHER HAVE IRON
Line_2476	THE MAGNET ON IT TRUCKS THE NAIL BECAUSE IT IS LIKE STEEL AND WOOD IS
Line_2477	BECAUSE IT IS STICKS TO THE MAGNETS IRON AND STEEL BUT NOT COPPER AND ALL THERE MAGNET
Line_2478	HAS STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET I MEAN THAT NO USE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN THE WHAT IS IN
Line_2479	THE BOTH HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_2480	MAGNET STICK TO IRON
Line_2481	NEXT STICK TO IRON NAIL IS AND MORE WHEN WOOD
Line_2482	SOME KNOWS CAN BE COPPER SO YOU CAN LIFT UP THAT YOU CAN SETUP WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2483	WHAT DIFFERENT BUT ARE ONE OF THEM IS STEEL OR ALSO IRON AND ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2484	ITS KNOW ONE OF THE KNOWS NOT TAKING UP ONE IS
Line_2485	ONE OF THE KNOW MIGHT BE STEEL OR IRON BUT ONE MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2486	BECAUSE THE YEAH
Line_2487	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2488	I THINK A STEEL FOR SHOWS STICKING AROUND TO THE MAGNET
Line_2489	IF THREE OF THEM DON'T SHAKE BEFORE TO STICK
Line_2490	IT WANTS TO COME
Line_2491	YES
Line_2492	I THINK IT IS STEEL
Line_2493	IT'S TAKES BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_2494	BECAUSE A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OUT OF IRON THAT A TYPE OF IRON THAT'S TAKE ARE TWO MAGNETS
Line_2495	IT MIGHT HAVE IRON
Line_2496	A LOOK ABOUT IRON AND MAGNETISM AND HOPELY A WORK
Line_2497	THE MAGNET IS STICKING ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS NORTH AND SOUTH AND IT
Line_2498	THE POOR IS GOING WITH THAT MAGNET IS GOING BECAUSE
Line_2499	EITHER IT IS FACING SOUTH NORTH OR NORTH SOUTH
Line_2500	IT'S A COMPASS TOUCHES THAT'S HOW IT WAS NORTH AND SOUTH POLE OF MAGNETS
Line_2501	A FUNCTION BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTING THE OTHER MAGNETS
Line_2502	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNET AND FILAMENTS
Line_2503	MAGNETISM IS UM
Line_2504	THEY ARE STILL STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2505	THE PAPER IS IT WILL BE TWO BUT THE MAGNET IT'S GOING AND THE PAPER CLIP IS STILL
Line_2506	IT HAS TOO MUCH FORCE
Line_2507	THERE IS WATCH THERE I DON'T KNOW
Line_2508	THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL AND THE NAIL STICKING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2509	THE NAIL WASN'T GIVING USING GETTING FORCE FROM THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_2510	IT IS SHOWING YOU THE FIELD AROUND THEN
Line_2511	THE MAGNET HAS IT'S A FIELD AROUND IT
Line_2512	THE MAGNET HAS A FIELD AROUND IT AND THEY NEED TO GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2513	MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2514	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE YOU NEED INTO THE MAGNET WAS SEPARATE
Line_2515	SEPARATE INTO THEY ARE GO TO
Line_2516	THE MAGNETS ARE AND WITH THE FORCE ARE GETTING THE SPACERS
Line_2517	THE MAGNETS WOULD BE SEPARATE UM WITH THE LESS MAGNET
Line_2518	WITH A BATTERY A SWITCH SOME WIRES A WIRE AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_2519	IT IS
Line_2520	YOU ARE NEED TO USE A CLOSE CIRCUIT FOR IT WORK
Line_2521	WHEN IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN IT'S A CLOSE CIRCUIT IT'S START GOOD
Line_2522	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THAT MEANS THAT'S THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL GO OUT TO NO WHERE
Line_2523	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE FLOWING AFTER NO WHERE AND THERE IS THE MAGNETS STICKING ON TO IT TO THE NAIL
Line_2524	IT WON'T WORK
Line_2525	THEY ARE D-CELL BATTERY WASHERS A SWICH A WIRE AND A STEEL THEY WHICH
Line_2526	AND A INTRESTING ELECTRICITY
Line_2527	THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH MAGNET AND AH
Line_2528	THAT'S UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_2529	BECAUSE THE RIVETS IS IN A MAGNET AND SO THE ELECTRICITY IS UM
Line_2530	YOU SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2531	IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE THINGS
Line_2532	IT'S SOMETHING IF IT HITS A MIRROR IT REFLECTS OF IT BUT IF IT HITS YOUR EYE THEN YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2533	THE LIGHT REFLECTS TO ANYTHING
Line_2534	THAT IT REFLECTS OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING
Line_2535	IF IT HITS ONE OF THE OBJECTS IN THE ROOM IT REFLECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_2536	IN THE ROOM THE LIGHT REFLECTS TO ALMOST ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WALL
Line_2537	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING THROUGH THE MIRROR AND THEN GOING INTO THE PERSON'S EYE
Line_2538	WHAT IS GOING ON IS THE PENCIL IS IN THE WATER
Line_2539	WHEN IT IS LOWER INTO THE WATER UM THE PENCIL MOVES
Line_2540	THAT THE LIGHT IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT COULD MAKE UH THE THE PLACE UM LIGHTER
Line_2541	THE LIGHT'S SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM IS GOING FIRST IT'S WHITE
Line_2542	THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN IT'S RAINBOW COLORS
Line_2543	IT TURNS INTO RAINBOW LIKE COLORS
Line_2544	I SEE SEVEN COLORS
Line_2545	THEY ARE WHITE AND THEN THEY SPREAD OUT INTO OTHERS
Line_2546	SEVEN
Line_2547	WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON IT REFLECTS TO THE BLUE BALL
Line_2548	WHEN IT'S BOUNCING OFF OF THE BALL THE BALL IS BLUE SO THE LIGHT IS TURNING BLUE WHEN IT HITS THE BLUE BALL
Line_2549	THIS IS A REFLECTING THROUGH THE BALL
Line_2550	IT IS TURNING YELLOW WHEN IT BOUNCES OFF THE BALL
Line_2551	THEY TURN RED OR ELSE DARK
Line_2552	YES BECAUSE THEY WILL TURNS THE COLORS THAT IS DARKER
Line_2553	WHAT HAPPEN IS THAT THE LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH THE FILTER THAT IS MAKING IT UM BLUE OR ELSE
Line_2554	IT WOULD JUST TURN DARK
Line_2555	IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR A RED ONE
Line_2556	BECAUSE IT IS
Line_2557	WHEN WHEN YOU TRY TO CLICK ON THE BLUE ONE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO CLICK ON THE RED ONE
Line_2558	UM THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT WATER THAT IS THE SOLUTION
Line_2559	A SOLUTE
Line_2560	THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE CAN MAKE SALT WATER
Line_2561	A SOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIXTURES BECAUSE UM ONE ITEM HAS DISSOLVED INTO THE OTHER ITEM
Line_2562	THE SALT
Line_2563	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALTWATER
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT IT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER SO IT STILL ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2565	IT IT'S ALL ADDED UP AND A NEW WEIGHT
Line_2566	THE MASS IS GETTING GREATER
Line_2567	THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND IF YOU ADD THEM IT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_2568	THE WATER HAS GAINED FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT AND THEREFORE IT IS SIXTY GRAMS OF SALTWATER
Line_2569	YOU CAN USE A COFFEE FILTER OR YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT
Line_2570	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2571	IT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL THE SAND CAN NOT MIX WITH THE THE WATER BECAUSE IT CAN'T DISSOLVE
Line_2572	IT HAS TURNED INTO A MIXTURE
Line_2573	IT IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID HAS BLENDED INTO THE WATER
Line_2574	YOU HAVE TO DISSOLVE THE WATER
Line_2575	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT AND THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUTE
Line_2576	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_2577	IT THE WATER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2578	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE
Line_2579	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE
Line_2580	UM YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTE TO SEPARATE IT
Line_2581	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES
Line_2582	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE USING EVAPORATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT WITH A FILTER
Line_2583	THEY ARE USING A MAGNET TO TAKE OUT THE PINS
Line_2584	THEY ARE SEPARATING GRAVEL AND ROCKS WITH A FILTER
Line_2585	GRAVEL AND WATER
Line_2586	SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_2587	THE GRAVEL IS BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER USING A SCREEN
Line_2588	THE MAGNET IS SUCKING UP THE LITTLE PINS WITH MAGNETITE
Line_2589	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN GET FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_2590	I NOTICE THAT THE WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS ARE THE MAGNET PICKED THEM RIGHT UP BECAUSE THEY'RE MAGNETIC
Line_2591	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL GOT SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FIT THROUGH
Line_2592	BECAUSE THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH IT AND THE GRAVEL CAN'T
Line_2593	THIS IS THE BEST FOR USING EVAPORATION TO SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE
Line_2594	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2595	TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU NEED A POWDER THAT CAN DISSOLVE INTO WATER
Line_2596	THE GRAPE POWDER IS GETTING PUT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2597	YOU CAN WEIGH IT WITH A SCALE OR YOU CAN SEE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2598	ONE SOLUTION HAS MORE GRAPE POWDER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2599	I SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE SCOOPS IN THE FIRST ONE AND THEN ONE SCOOP IN THE SECOND ONE
Line_2600	YOU CAN WEIGH BOTH SOLUTIONS USING GRAMS AND THE ONE THAT WEIGHS MORE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2601	A SCALE
Line_2602	THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2603	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS USUALLY HAVE MORE POWDER
Line_2604	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONES WITH LIGHTER
Line_2605	THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE DILUTED
Line_2606	IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2607	I THINK IT WOULD TASTE STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE POWDER YOU HAVE THE STRONGER IT'LL BE
Line_2608	IT WOULD TASTE LIGHTER AND MORE DILUTED
Line_2609	IT WOULD NOT BE AS STRONG AS THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAPE POWDER
Line_2610	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER TO THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2611	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_2612	YOU CAN ADD MORE POWDER OR ADD MORE WATER
Line_2613	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2614	WE HAVE MADE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS AND COOL AID SOLUTIONS
Line_2615	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT TO THIS WATER
Line_2616	THE ROCK IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FEATHER BECAUSE THE FEATHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAM
Line_2617	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2618	ONE CUP HAS TEN TEN GRAMS MORE SOLUTE
Line_2619	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE SALT THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2620	I WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2621	ONE HAS TEN MORE GRAMS OF SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_2622	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE OF THE SOLUTE THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS AND IT WEIGHS LESS
Line_2623	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM
Line_2624	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2625	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2626	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2627	SOLUTION B
Line_2628	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2629	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2630	IT'S DISSOLVING THE SALT AND IT'S GETTING SATURATED
Line_2631	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED
Line_2632	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2633	THAT MEANS THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT INTO IT
Line_2634	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED WITH SUGAR
Line_2635	IT CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2636	THIS SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2637	THE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2638	YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE
Line_2639	THAT MEANS IT'S NOT SOLUBLE
Line_2640	THE POWDER IS
Line_2641	YOU NEED A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT
Line_2642	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_2643	THE WATER IS GETTING SATURATED
Line_2644	THAT MEANS THE UM WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2645	THE EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2646	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2647	THE THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE SALT
Line_2648	IT LEAVES SOME OF THE SALT ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2649	ONE OF THE SIDES IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE IT'S HAS SALT IN
Line_2650	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2651	EACH SOLUTE EACH ONE OF THE THINGS IS
Line_2652	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2653	SATURATING SOLUTIONS
Line_2654	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TOGETHER TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2655	IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2656	WE MIX CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND THEN CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND CITRIC ACID AND THEN FINALLY BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
Line_2657	I THINK SO BECAUSE BAKING SODA WHEN IT HIT WHEN IT HITS WATER IT FIZZES
Line_2658	WATER THE SOLVENT
Line_2659	THEY MIX TOGETHER AND SEPARATE
Line_2660	THEY ARE MIXED TO CREATE A NEW MOLECULE
Line_2661	THEY WILL MIX TOGETHER AND CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2662	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2663	THE SOLUTION HAS LEFT A PRECIPITATE
Line_2664	IT HAS MADE A NEW MOLECULE
Line_2665	THERE HAVE BEEN PURPLE MOLECULES CREATED IN THE WATER
Line_2666	IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF THE WATER
Line_2667	I SAW
Line_2668	IT GOT COLD
Line_2669	THE TWO MIXTURES THE TWO SOLUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT IS PINK
Line_2670	YES BECAUSE THE PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2671	IT HAS MADE A PINK PRODUCT
Line_2672	HE MADE A POOP IN THE
Line_2673	IS HAPPENING IT'S GETTING
Line_2674	THERE IS A CHEMICAL THE BIKE HAS
Line_2675	WENT INTO
Line_2676	ARE TOO AND
Line_2677	YES BECAUSE IT IS GLOWING
Line_2678	IT HAS MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2679	YES BECAUSE THE GRAPE THE WATER HAS TURNED PURPLE
Line_2680	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURING
Line_2681	TWO REACTANTS COMBINING
Line_2682	IF THERE IS A PRODUCT
Line_2683	THE PRODUCT IS THE REMAINING THING AT THE BOTTOM
Line_2684	BAKING SODA AND CHEMICAL CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2685	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2686	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL AND SOIL ROCKS AND LAND FORMS
Line_2687	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_2688	WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2689	I SEE LOTS OF CLAY SILT GRAVEL AND HUMUS
Line_2690	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2691	HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2692	THERE ARE THESE SOILS ARE FROM DIFFERENT STRIPS
Line_2693	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2694	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2695	SAND CLAY GRAVEL PEBBLES AND ORGANIC MATTER
Line_2696	ALL SOILS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT CLIMATES
Line_2697	THEY BOTH THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2698	THEY ARE SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE GRAVEL
Line_2699	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY MOST OF THEM HAVE SAND
Line_2700	THE DELTA HAS MORE HUMUS AND MORE SAND AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE'S A TINY BIT OF GRAVEL
Line_2701	IN THE DELTA THERE IS MORE SAND IN THE DESERT THERE IS MORE GRAVEL THAN SAND
Line_2702	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS SOILS AND LAND FORMS
Line_2703	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STREAM TABLES
Line_2704	THE STREAM TABLE WITH A SLOPE HAS A BIGGER FAN THE ONE WITHOUT A SLOPE HAS A SMALLER FAN
Line_2705	A RIVER THAT IS STEEP IT FLOWS DOWN A RIVER THAT IS FLAT GOES SLOW
Line_2706	IN THE ONE WITH THE STEEP THERE IS THE WATER IS GOING FAST BUT THE ONE WITH THE FLAT IT IS GOING SLOW
Line_2707	THE WATER ON THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING SLOW AND THE WATER ON THE SLEEP STEEP SLOPE IS GOING FAST
Line_2708	THE FLOW OF THE WATER THAT'S FASTER
Line_2709	WHEN I CHEW GUM I MAKE BUBBLES
Line_2710	THE FLOOD CONDITIONS HAVE MADE MORE CANYONS THAN THE STANDARD CONDITIONS
Line_2711	DURING A FLOOD THE WATER GOES UP HIGHER THAN IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_2712	ONE'S FASTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2713	IT'S PICKS UP AND STARTS GOING FASTER
Line_2714	IN TWENTY FOUR SECOND THE FLOOD HAS TAKEN DOWN TREES AND ROCKS FROM THE LAND
Line_2715	AN EARTHQUAKE
Line_2716	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS CRACKING BECAUSE OF WEATHER
Line_2717	CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2718	THE ROCK HAS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS THAT IS CALLED PHYSICAL WEATHERING
Line_2719	THE ROCK SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS
Line_2720	I NOTICE THAT THE ROCK WENT DOWN THROUGH WATER AND WAS STILL MOVING
Line_2721	THE ROOTS ARE BREAK ARE GOING INTO THE ROCK AND ARE EXPANDING TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2722	WHEN WATER FILLS UP A CRACK IN THE ROCK AND IT FREEZES THEN THE ICE THE WATER EXPANDS AND CRACKS THE ROCK
Line_2723	WHEN WATER GETS INTO A CRACK OF THE ROCK IT FREEZES AND EXPANDS TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2724	THE WATER GOT INTO THE ROCK AND FROZE AND EXPANDED TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2725	IT EXPANDS AND
Line_2726	THE FREEZING JAR HAS CRACKED THE ICE BECAUSE THE WATER HAS EXPANDED
Line_2727	THE WATER HAS EXPANDED AND BROKE THE GLASS
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE WATER EXPANDS
Line_2729	THE PILE OF ROCKS AT THE ON THE LEFT ARE PEBBLES AND THE AND THE ROCKS ON THE RIGHT ARE GRAVEL
Line_2730	THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_2731	WEATHERING CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2732	BECAUSE THE DELTA GRAVEL HAS HIT OTHER ROCKS GOING DOWN
Line_2733	HEY WHAT'S GOING ON GUYS IT'S
Line_2734	GOODBYE THANK YOU I LOVE YOU WILL YOU MARRY ME
Line_2735	EROSION
Line_2736	I REALLY GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Line_2737	THERE IS WATER WITH THE STEEP SLOPE AND ONE THAT IS FLAT
Line_2738	ON THE ON THE STEEP SLOPE THE WATER'S GOING FAST
Line_2739	I TOLD YOU ALREADY
Line_2740	THE FLOOD IS GOING FAST CAUSING MORE EROSION AND DEPOSITION AND NORMAL IS
Line_2741	DURING THE FLOOD THE WATER'S GOING REALLY FAST WHEN IT'S NORMAL IT'S GOING NORMAL SPEED
Line_2742	DURING THE FLOOD IT IS GOING REALLY FAST
Line_2743	IT HAS MORE ENERGY
Line_2744	LISTEN TO MY EYE
Line_2745	A VOLCANIC ERUPTION AND WHY IS IT GOING PERFECT
Line_2746	WHY DO YOU TAKE SO LONG TO TALK BACK
Line_2747	RAPID CHANGE
Line_2748	SLOW
Line_2749	IT WAS SLOW
Line_2750	A LONG TIME
Line_2751	FAST CHANGE
Line_2752	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIRRORS AND HOW LIGHT CAN REFLECT OFF OF THEM
Line_2753	UHM BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR THE THE ELECTROMAGNETISM TO BE INDUCED
Line_2754	THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET WHICH INDUCES ELECTROMAGNETISM WHICH MAKES IT ALL
Line_2755	UHM IT INDUCES MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES THE RIVET AN ELECTROMAGNET WHICH IS A WHICH ALLOWS IT TO PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_2756	IT INDUCES MAGNETISM BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2757	WELL IF THERE'S NO FLOW OF ELECTRICITY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING THE WHOLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2758	ALL OF THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT EITHER OPENS STOPS THE CIRCUIT OR COMPLETES IT
Line_2759	WELL WITHOUT ELECTRICITY AN ELECTROMAGNET WOULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE IT INDUCES THE MAGNETISM
Line_2760	THE WIRES HAVE THERE HAS TO BE ENOUGH COILS WITH THE WIRE FOR IT TO INDUCE MAGNETISM
Line_2761	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET WHICH IS INDUCING MAGNETISM IN THE RIVET WHICH IS ALLOWING THE IT TO PICK UP THE WASHER
Line_2762	IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY THING BESIDES MAGNETS AND MAGNETIZE THAT CAN PICK UP MAGNETS
Line_2763	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND MIRRORS
Line_2764	LIGHT HOW YOU SEE THINGS IS LIGHT BOUNCES OFF OF THEM WHICH AND THEY BOUNCES BACK TO YOUR EYES WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SEE IT
Line_2765	WHAT IT IS SHOWING LIGHT AND IT'S BOUNCING BACK TO THE EYES AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT IS BOUNCING BACK TO US
Line_2766	IT BOUNCES OFF
Line_2767	UHM YOU SEE SOMETHING
Line_2768	UHM WHEN IT HITS THE OBJECT IT BOUNCES BACK OFF
Line_2769	THERE'S GLASS
Line_2770	LEARNING ABOUT MIRRORS AND LIGHTS AND ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_2771	THEY'RE ALL HAVE LIKE THIS WHITE BRIGHT THINGS SHINING AROUND THEM
Line_2772	FLASHLIGHTS UHM CANDLES LIGHT BULBS
Line_2773	LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH A PRISM WHICH IS BREAKING THE WHITE LIGHT UP INTO EACH COLOR WHICH ARE THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2774	UHM THERE IT'S WHITE LIGHT THROUGH TO THE PRISM AND OUT IT'S THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2775	IT THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH IS WHITE UNTIL IT HITS THE PRISM WHERE IT TURNS TO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2776	THE WHITE LIGHT'S HITTING THE BLUE WALL AND IT'S BOUNCING OUT AS BLUE LIGHT
Line_2777	WHEN IT'S IT'S GOING HITTING THE BALL THE WHITE WALL IT'S COMING OFF IT'S BLUE
Line_2778	WHEN THE LIGHT HIT THE WHITE LIGHT HITS IT EVERY COLOR BUT BLUE IS ABSORBED SO BLUE REFLECTS OUT
Line_2779	IT'S THE ONLY COLOR NOT GETTING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
Line_2780	THE LIGHT WILL SINCE IT'S NOT GLASS WELL IT'S REFLECTING OFF SINCE THE BALL AND IT'S COMING OUT AS BLUE
Line_2781	IT'S ABSORBED WITH THE BLUE LIGHT GETS REFLECTED
Line_2782	THE YELLOW BALL IT'S THEY BOUNCE OFF AS YELLOW BECAUSE EVERY OTHER COLOR IS BEING ABSORBED BUT YELLOW
Line_2783	THAT NOT ALL OF THEM THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE COMING BACK
Line_2784	THE BALL'S REFLECTING BLUE LIGHT AND THE YELLOW BALL'S REFLECTING YELLOW LIGHT
Line_2785	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FILTERING LIGHT AND THE LIGHT IS GETTING FILTERED BY THIS RED SHEET
Line_2786	THE NOTE CARDS PLACED BEHIND THE FILTER IT RUNS RED BUT WHEN THE BLUE ONE IS IT STILL TURNS BLUE
Line_2787	JUST TURNED DARKER IT DIDN'T BLACK FULLY
Line_2788	SOME LIGHT THE RED AND BLUE LIGHT WILL NOT WILL DON'T CHANGE THE COLOR BUT THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHT
Line_2789	IT'S THE SAME COLOR AS DARK DARK GREEN BUT WHEN AS FOR RED AND BLUE BUT GREEN LIGHT IT MAKES IT JUST BRIGHTER
Line_2790	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN I'M GUESSING
Line_2791	GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT IT JUST STAYS THE SAME BUT FOR THE RED LIGHT IT TURN
Line_2792	BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND LIGHTS AND MIRRORS
Line_2793	IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_2794	UHM THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2795	BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIRRORS LIGHTS ELECTROMAGNETS AND FILTERING LIGHTS
Line_2796	UHM THEY EACH HAVE THEIR SEPARATE PATHWAY
Line_2797	IS A SERIES NO PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2798	PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAVE EACH OF THE LIGHT BULBS HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY SAME HERE
Line_2799	UHM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN THEY HAVE THEIR
Line_2800	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2801	UHM I THINK THIS CIRCUIT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2802	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAYS
Line_2803	THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY THEY DON'T SHARE IT
Line_2804	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2805	I THINK IT'S STILL THEY'D STILL BE BRIGHTER
Line_2806	UHM THE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ON THE TOP ARE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2807	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT LASTS LONGER THAN THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2808	THE SERIES THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_2809	BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIRRORS LIGHTS FILTERING LIGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC
Line_2810	UHM A STRING OF LIGHT IS A BUNCH OF LIGHT IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2811	THE THE OTHER ONE BURNS OUT TOO
Line_2812	BULB IS BURNED OUT SO ON THE ONE STOPS BURNING
Line_2813	UHM WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER DOES NOT BURN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SHARING THE SAME PATH OF ELECTRICITY
Line_2814	UHM WHEN ONE DIES OUT THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT AND WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT AGAIN IT TURNS BACK ON
Line_2815	WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE THE OTHER ONE DOES BECAUSE THEY SHARE THE SAME FLOW
Line_2816	UHM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT NO SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2817	IT IT STOPS GLOWING THE IT STOPS GLOWING NOT
Line_2818	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYMORE WHEN ONE'S BURNED OUT BECAUSE THERE'S A HOLE IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_2819	UHM THEY ARE ALL BRIGHT
Line_2820	WHITE IT IS WHITE
Line_2821	I THINK IT CAN COME FROM LIGHT BULBS AND OVERHEAD LIGHT
Line_2822	I CAN SEE A LIGHT BULB
Line_2823	THE LIGHT IS UHM THE WHITE LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH A PRISM AND BEING BROKEN APART INTO THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2824	PRISM BREAKS UP THE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2825	IS SPLITTING LIGHT APART INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2826	I'LL TELL YOU THAT I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE LIGHT UHM BOUNCES OFF THE BLUE BALL AS BLUE LIGHT
Line_2827	UHM I DON'T KNOW OH THE UH BLUE BALL IS FILTERING BLUE LIGHT OUT OF THE WHITE LIGHT
Line_2828	IT'S BOUNCING OFF OF THE BALL IS BLUE
Line_2829	THE LIGHT IS GETTING FILTERED INTO YELLOW LIGHT
Line_2830	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BALL IS YELLOW LIGHT BECAUSE THE BALL IS REFLECTING THE YELLOW LIGHT OUT OF THE WHITE
Line_2831	LIGHT RAYS THAT ARE HITTING THE BALL ARE WHITE THE LIGHT RAYS REFLECTING OFF OF THE BALL ARE YELLOW
Line_2832	THEY ARE YELLOW
Line_2833	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT OR I MEAN ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2834	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2835	THEY'RE SHOWING UH PATTERN WHICH
Line_2836	OKAY HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2837	WE'VE BEEN DOING ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2838	THEY'RE FORMING THE CONSTELLATION ORION
Line_2839	THEY'RE CALLED CONSTELLATIONS
Line_2840	IT'S ORION
Line_2841	IT RISES FROM THE EAST AND SETS IN THE WEST
Line_2842	WELL THE EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN AND SO IT'S TURNING AROUND CONSTANTLY
Line_2843	THE EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN
Line_2844	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND CIRCUITS
Line_2845	UHM I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_2846	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE BOYS EYE
Line_2847	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_2848	LIGHT LETS YOU SEE THINGS UH IT REFLECTS OFF THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE THEM
Line_2849	I KNOW THAT LIGHT REFLECTS UH OFF ANYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
Line_2850	THEY'RE REFLECTING OFF OF THEM
Line_2851	THEY HAVE TO BE SOLID FOR LIGHT TO REFLECT OFF OF THEM
Line_2852	I NOTICE THAT THEY REFLECT OFF DIFFERENT LENGTHS
Line_2853	LIGHT REFLECTS OFF DIFFERENT WAYS WHEN IT HITS A SOLID OBJECT
Line_2854	THE LIGHT IS SHINING ONTO THE BOY AND THEN ONTO THE MIRROR SO THAT HE CAN SEE HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR
Line_2855	BECAUSE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND SHOOTING OVER TO HIM
Line_2856	IT'S BEING USED TO REFLECT LIKE A SPOTLIGHT ON A BUILDING
Line_2857	UHM THE LIGHT REFLECTS BACK OVER TO THE FIRST MIRROR
Line_2858	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE MIRRORS AND IT'S HITTING THEM SO THAT THEY REFLECT ONTO THE ONE OTHER MIRROR
Line_2859	THE THE LIGHT HITS THE LAST STAR
Line_2860	UH A PENCIL IS IN THE WATER AND IT'S REFLECTING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BROKEN
Line_2861	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING BROKEN
Line_2862	THE WATER THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE WATER TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE PENCIL ON THE LEFT IS BROKEN
Line_2863	WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT HITTING WATER AND HITTING DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_2864	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND REFLECTION
Line_2865	THEY'RE ALL MAKING LIGHT WITH ENERGY
Line_2866	YOU CAN SEE THAT UHM THEY'RE CHANGING COLORS
Line_2867	A CANDLE A LIGHT BULB AND THE SUN
Line_2868	A PRISM BREAKS UP THE WHITE LIGHT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW WHITE LIGHT IS CONTAIN WHITE LIGHT CONTAINS ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW IN
Line_2869	UHM THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BLUE BALL AND TURNING BLUE
Line_2870	UHM I DON'T KNOW
Line_2871	THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF A YELLOW BALL AND TURNING YELLOW AND GOING TO THE SIDE
Line_2872	THEY'RE ONE IS WHITE LIGHT AND ONE IS YELLOW
Line_2873	ONE BULB IS BLUE AND ONE BULB IS YELLOW
Line_2874	UHM IT HAS LIGHT AND YOU'RE BREAKING UP THE LIGHT INTO RED
Line_2875	THEY TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2876	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE THINGS UH WOULD CHANGE
Line_2877	IT TURNS THE LIGHT BLUE
Line_2878	YELLOW AND BLUE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS SO WHEN THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER THEY KIND OF MAKE OTHER COLOR
Line_2879	SOME THINGS TURN THE SAME COLOR BUT SOME THINGS TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2880	THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER GREEN BUT THE RED AND THE BLUE ARE WILL MAKE IT LOOK THE SAME
Line_2881	UHM WELL THE LIGHT TURNS DIFFERENT COLOR THINGS DIFFERENT
Line_2882	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN IT'LL LOOK GREENER
Line_2883	THEY TURN BROWNISH IN THE GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT AND TURNS MORE REDDISH IN THE RED LIGHT
Line_2884	RED AND GREEN AREN'T AND OR UH BLUE AND GREEN AREN'T ANY DIFFERENT BUT RED IS REDDER
Line_2885	I'M BAD BLAH
Line_2886	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND CIRCUITS AND LIGHT AND THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AND REFLECTION
Line_2887	AT NIGHT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH LIGHT AND IN THE DAY THERE IS
Line_2888	THE SUN GOES UP ON THE WEST AND COMES OR UP ON THE EAST AND COMES DOWN IN THE WEST AND THERE'S CONSTELLATIONS IN THE SKY
Line_2889	THE CONSTELLATIONS GO AWAY
Line_2890	AT NIGHT THERE'S STARS
Line_2891	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT NIGHT THE NIGHT SKY LIGHT AND ENERGY AND ALL CIRCUITS AND STUFF
Line_2892	UHM IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOON AND THE HOW IT DOES
Line_2893	IT'S THE ROTATIONS OF THE MOON
Line_2894	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE MOON GOES AROUND THE SUN
Line_2895	I'M DONE WITH THE FIRST SECOND
Line_2896	WANING CRESCENT
Line_2897	IT'S ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE MOON
Line_2898	EITHER MOSTLY FULL OR YEAH THEY'RE MOSTLY FULL
Line_2899	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE LIKE THREE OR YEAH THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY FULL
Line_2900	CRESCENTS ARE UHM MOSTLY UH NOT FULL
Line_2901	COLORS
Line_2902	THEY ALL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_2903	IT IS WHITE LIGHT
Line_2904	THE SUN LIGHT BULB OR CANDLESTICK
Line_2905	GET SPLIT UP TO MANY COLORS
Line_2906	A RAINBOW
Line_2907	IT'S A RAINBOW
Line_2908	THEY'RE PRETTY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2909	I DON'T KNOW I'M DONE WITH THIS
Line_2910	WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT HITS THE BLUE BALL IT TURNS INTO BLUE
Line_2911	THE ONE HITTING THE BALL IS STILL LIGHT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE BLUE
Line_2912	SAME THING JUST THE IT'S JUST YELLOW THIS TIME
Line_2913	IT'S REFLECTING
Line_2914	THE ONE THAT HITS IT IS HITTING A WHITE SPIT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE HITTING A YELLOW SPOT
Line_2915	UHM WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PAPER IT CHANGES THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT
Line_2916	SHADES OF LIGHT AH
Line_2917	THEY CHANGE COLOR
Line_2918	YES I GET IT OKAY
Line_2919	I DON'T KNOW IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2920	OF COURSE YEAH
Line_2921	PUT THE BATTERY ON TOP OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2922	A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_2923	THE PATHWAY OF ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2924	LIGHT BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT TURN ON THE WIRES AND THE THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO POWER ON LIGHT BULB
Line_2925	WHEN THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON IT'S BECAUSE THE ENERGY CIRCUIT POWERS THROUGH THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT
Line_2926	I SEE ELECTRICITY HEATING THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT
Line_2927	IT'S GOING TO THE MINUS SIGN AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN AND IT KEEPS ROTATING AGAIN
Line_2928	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A CIRCUIT THAT CONNECTS TO
Line_2929	ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE
Line_2930	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_2931	THE POSITIVE SIDE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2932	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE OPPOSITE
Line_2933	THE FLOWS GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2934	THE NEW FLIP IT IT IT CHANGES DIRECTIONS
Line_2935	I THINK IT I THINK
Line_2936	OH OKAY UH GOOD
Line_2937	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2938	THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2939	SOLUTIONS
Line_2940	ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
Line_2941	THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
Line_2942	THE SALT WILL WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE
Line_2944	WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2945	THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2946	I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2947	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTIONS
Line_2948	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE
Line_2949	THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THAT THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED INTO
Line_2950	HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
Line_2951	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_2952	THE SALT
Line_2953	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT
Line_2954	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
Line_2955	THE MASS IS INCREASING
Line_2956	ONE KIND OF GRAMS PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS GRAM TOGETHER
Line_2957	SOLUTION
Line_2958	THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2959	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND
Line_2960	YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE
Line_2961	THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
Line_2962	UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2963	SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2964	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2965	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAS MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAD LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
Line_2966	I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUFF
Line_2967	IT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_2968	IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVORFUL AND GRAPE
Line_2969	I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
Line_2970	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
Line_2971	BYE MARNI IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER
Line_2972	I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRIEND ON CRUTCHES
Line_2973	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY ONES YOU CAN'T SEE
Line_2974	ONE OF THEM HAS GRAPE MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER SOLUTION IN THEM
Line_2975	YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_2976	THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_2977	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2978	I THINK THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS
Line_2979	I FOUND OUT THAT THAT THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHED A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
Line_2980	BY DOING GRAM ADDING
Line_2981	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2982	ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2983	I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2984	BYE MARNI IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE BYE
Line_2985	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND THAT SALT AND WATER MIX THE SALT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2986	IT RELATES BY MIXING WATER WITH SOLIDS
Line_2987	WE CALL IT A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIXES TOGETHER
Line_2988	WE WOULD CALL THESE SOLUTIONS
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF TRAIL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FILTERS OUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INGREDIENTS
Line_2990	THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS ARE GETTING SEPARATED OUT OF THE MAIN PILE
Line_2991	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE GIANT MASS OF SOLID
Line_2992	THE SCREEN IS FILTERING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_2993	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY SEPARATED
Line_2994	THE SALT AND WATER
Line_2995	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2996	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND WITH THIS MIXTURE IT BECOMES A SOLUTION NOT JUST A MIXTURE
Line_2997	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_2998	WE'RE LEARNING THAT ALL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_2999	THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3000	A SOLVENT
Line_3001	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND IS BECOMING A MIXTURE WITH THE WATER
Line_3002	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECAME A SOLUTION
Line_3003	ALL OF THE MATERIALS WEIGHT DIDN'T ADD OR SUBTRACT THEY ALL JUST GOT ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3004	IT SHOWS US THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS KEEP THEIR SAME MASS WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3005	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3006	SOLUTION
Line_3007	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3008	IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE
Line_3009	YOU CAN FILTER IT OUT IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_3010	THE SALT WATER DID NOT FILTER OUT
Line_3011	A SOLUTION
Line_3012	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3013	IT'S EVAPORATING
Line_3014	IT'S LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE SO THE MATERIAL IS STILL THERE
Line_3015	YOU COULD LET THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_3016	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
Line_3017	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3018	BECAUSE IT SEPARATES THE TWO
Line_3019	MAGNETS AND SCREENS
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE SIEVE SEPARATES THE LARGE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN'T UM FIT THROUGH THE SMALLER HOLES
Line_3021	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THE MAGNET DRAWS ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT
Line_3022	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3023	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL WOULD STAY ON TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WOULD FALL THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3024	EVERY MATERIAL OTHER THAN THE SALT STAYS IN THE FILTER BUT THE SALT FLOWS THROUGH
Line_3025	TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENTS OUT OTHER THAN THE SALT
Line_3026	SALT WATER YOU EVAPORATE THE WATER SO THE SALT CRYSTALS CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND THEY TAKE UP A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3027	THAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_3028	HI MARTIE YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY TODAY NOT
Line_3029	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3030	YOU DISSOLVE A SOLUTE INTO A SOLVENT
Line_3031	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3032	LIKE IN THE GRAPE FANTASTIC EXAMPLE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE PURPLE THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3033	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3034	TASTE COLOR AND
Line_3035	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS CONCENTRATION AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE CONCENTRATION
Line_3036	THAT THEY'VE MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3037	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS CONCENTRATE
Line_3038	LESS FLAVORFUL
Line_3039	ONE TASTE MORE WATERY AND ONE TASTE MORE FULL OF FLAVOR
Line_3040	ADDING DIFFERENT INGREDIENT
Line_3041	ADDING OR TAKING AWAY WATER
Line_3042	BYE MARNI I'LL MISS YOU
Line_3043	GOOD HOW ARE YOU BARNY
Line_3044	THE DRINKS ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE DRINKS ON THE RIGHT ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3045	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX YOU CAN TELL IT
Line_3046	YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH A BALANCE
Line_3047	THE CONCENTRATION
Line_3048	ONE OF THE CUPS IS MORE UH CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER CUP
Line_3049	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3050	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE BECAUSE IT'S HEAVIER
Line_3051	MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WAS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3052	THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AS IT GOES TO THE RIGHT THEY GET MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3053	THE MOST CONCENTRATED IS ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS TWO
Line_3054	THE MOST IS ONE IS TWO
Line_3055	B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND C IS THE LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3056	BYE MARNI I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH
Line_3057	WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE MYSTERY INGREDIENT IN MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS BY FILTER AND SCREENING AND ALL THE SCIENTIFIC STUFF
Line_3058	IT FLOATS
Line_3059	IT SINKS
Line_3060	THAT SOLUTION SATURATED THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3061	ONE HAS MORE DENSITY AND ONE HAS LESS DENSITY
Line_3062	IT WOULD SINK
Line_3063	IF A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT'S LESS DENSE
Line_3064	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION GOES TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT IS LESS LESS DENSE
Line_3065	THEY'RE CREATING A DIFFERENT SOLUTION WITH EQUAL CONCENTRATION
Line_3066	ONE RISES TO THE TOP AND ONE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3067	ONE'S MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER SO ONE FLOATS ON THE TOP OF THE OTHER
Line_3068	THEY POURED SOLUTION A FIRST AND SOLUTION B SECOND
Line_3069	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IS IS MORE
Line_3070	BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION PLUS ANOTHER SOLUTION EQUALS A BIGGER SOLUTION
Line_3071	THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE LEAST DENSE
Line_3072	THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3073	BY MARNI I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I'M EXCITED FOR OUR NEXT LESSON
Line_3074	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3075	THE SOLUTION CREATED SALT WHEN IT DISSOLVED
Line_3076	THE CHEMICALS IN THE MATERIALS CREATING THE SOLUTION MADE SALT
Line_3077	THE INGREDIENTS MADE A NEW PRODUCT
Line_3078	THE MIXTURE CREATED GAS
Line_3079	THEY CHANGED TO FORM GAS AND SALT
Line_3080	THERE'S DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_3081	THE TWO MIXED TOGETHER AND MATH HAPPENED
Line_3082	THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
Line_3083	IT TELLS ME THAT EVERYTHING ON EARTH CAN'T BE REMADE OR DESTROYED
Line_3084	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE LET THE GAS GO AND ONE KEPT THE GAS SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3085	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND ONE BAG IS CLOSED
Line_3086	WE LEARN LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES AND
Line_3087	YOU'RE SEPARATING THEM INTO DIFFERENT PILES OF WHAT THEY
Line_3088	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A MIX
Line_3089	THEY ARE IN GROUPS AND OF WHAT THEY ARE
Line_3090	THEY'RE FILTERING IT OUT SO THAT IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANY
Line_3091	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_3092	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT IS IT GOT SEPARATED AND IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_3093	THEY DON'T THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3094	IT IS FILTERING OUT THE SAND
Line_3095	THE SALT UM
Line_3096	THE SALT GETS DISSOLVED TO MAKE THE WATER HIGHER
Line_3097	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND
Line_3098	YES YOU CAN GET IT OUT BY EVAPORATING THE WATER
Line_3099	IT CAN NOT GET SEPARATED
Line_3100	MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS CAN NOT
Line_3101	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3102	THEY CAN BE THEY THEY WHAT
Line_3103	MIXTURES BY A SCREEN MAGNETISM AND DENSITY
Line_3104	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
Line_3105	A MIXTURE
Line_3106	TO SEPARATE THE ROCK
Line_3107	BECAUSE THAT THING IS MAGNETIC SO IT'D STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_3108	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY BE MAGNETIC AND THEY MIGHT NOT
Line_3109	IT WORKED BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3110	CAUSE PAPER BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3111	IT SEPARATED OUT THE ROCKS BECAUSE THE THE SIZE OF THE THE SCREEN FITS IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3113	IT WORKED BECAUSE IT DOES IT DOESN'T IT CAN'T GOT THROUGH
Line_3114	BECAUSE SAND CAN'T GO THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT WORKED
Line_3115	IT WORKED BECAUSE ALL THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT WAS BACK THEN
Line_3116	IT MEANS THAT IT THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE SEPARATED AND NO OTHER WAY WOULD WORK
Line_3117	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE ALL EVERYTHING IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_3118	TRYING TO PROVE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TOGETHER IT CHANGES IT'S PROPERTIES
Line_3119	YOU ARE MIXING SAND AND WATER TOGETHER TO MAKE A SAND AND WATER SOLUTION
Line_3120	THE SALT THE SALT WILL
Line_3121	THE SALT GOT MIXED IN AND THE AND DISSOLVED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3122	IT DISSOLVED TO SHOW THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3123	IT IS A THING THAT IS THAT IS NOT GETTING DISSOLVED
Line_3124	BECAUSE THEY THEY STAY TOGETHER OR AND THEY CAN NOT BE SEPARATED
Line_3125	THE SALT IS A SOLUTE AND IT GETS DISSOLVED
Line_3126	IT IS THE SOLVENT AND THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO IT
Line_3127	A SOLUTE
Line_3128	IT IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND HEAVIER THAN EACH SEPARATE
Line_3129	WHEN YOU ADD IT TOGETHER IT ADDS THE GRAMS OF THE SALT
Line_3130	IT IS ADDING MORE WEIGHT
Line_3131	IT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT ADDS MORE WEIGHT
Line_3132	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVY
Line_3133	THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3134	IT'S FIFTY PLUS FIFTY PLUS FIFTEEN AND IT SHOWS THAT THE SALT KEEPS IT'S OWN OR KEEPS IT'S OWN WEIGHT
Line_3135	SOLUTION
Line_3136	YOU CAN EITHER SEPARATE IT BY EVAPORATING IT LIKE SALT AND WATER OR USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_3137	YOU'RE SEPARATING OUT THE FLOUR BY PUTTING IT IN THE FILTER AND YOU'RE SEPARATING THEM
Line_3138	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3139	A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE CAUSE THE SAND IS SEPARATED AND IF IT HAD STAYED IN THE WATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SOLUTION
Line_3140	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3141	THE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED AND INTO THE WATER AND IT COULDN'T BE SEPARATED WITH THIS FILTER
Line_3142	SOLUTION
Line_3143	AND IN SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE SALT OUT
Line_3144	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND THEN YOU EVAPORATED IT SO THEN IT IT IT WAS BACK TO THE THE SALT AGAIN
Line_3145	IT IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AGAIN
Line_3146	IT IS EVAPORATING
Line_3147	IT WORKED THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION BUT BUT YEAH
Line_3148	ONLY SALT TO SHOW THAT IT WORKED TO SEPARATE IT OUT
Line_3149	THEY ARE PERFECT SQUARES THE SO THE SALT DIDN'T CONTAIN IT'S SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3150	IT REQUIRES TIME YOU NEED TIME TO EVAPORATE STUFF
Line_3151	THE YOU YOU CAN'T SEPARATE A A SOLUTE FROM A SOLUTION AND YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT AND WATER BY EVAPORATION
Line_3152	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3153	A SOLUTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED HOW YOU MAKE IT IS YOU MIX SOMETHING TOGETHER
Line_3154	A SOLUTE
Line_3155	YOU CAN SEE BY HOW HOW THE DIFFERENT THE COLOR
Line_3156	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND IT IS DARKER
Line_3157	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3158	THE MORE COLOR IT HAS OR HOW OR HOW MUCH MORE POWDER IT HAS
Line_3159	THE MORE POWDER IT HAD
Line_3160	THE DARKER OR LIGHTER THE COLOR IS
Line_3161	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3162	IT IS LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3163	IT WOULD TASTE MORE FLAVORFUL
Line_3164	IT WOULD TASTE UH LESS CONCENTRATED OR LESS FLAVORFUL
Line_3165	IT IS NOT AS SWEET AND FLAVORFUL
Line_3166	YOU CAN UH DO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER SO IT'D HAVE LESS IN IT
Line_3167	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER SO IT WOULD BE MORE SPREAD OUT
Line_3168	ADD MORE WATER
Line_3169	BYE
Line_3170	WE ARE WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3171	ONE'S A MIXTURE ONE'S A SOLUTE
Line_3172	THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY
Line_3173	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE
Line_3174	WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF IN SCIENCE
Line_3175	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TWENTY
Line_3176	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TEN GRAMS OF
Line_3177	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_3178	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE WEIGHED
Line_3179	BECAUSE ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS THE OTHER HAS TEN
Line_3180	THE GRAPE ONE GETS DARKER AND DARKER WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED AND MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3181	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_3182	THE MOST IS ONE THE LEST IS THREE
Line_3183	ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3184	YOU'RE WEIRD
Line_3185	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3186	YOU ADD A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND IF IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT IT IS A
Line_3187	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3188	YOU ADD THINGS TOGETHER AND IF IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THEM IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3189	THE FIRST ONE HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND THEREFORE IT IS MORE DENSE
Line_3190	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER SO IT IS MORE
Line_3191	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THEREFORE IT IS MORE
Line_3192	HOW DARK OR LIGHT IT IS OR HOW DENSE OR HOW CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3193	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND IS THEREFORE LESS OR MORE
Line_3194	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE DENSE AND THE LIGHTER ONES ARE LESS DENSE
Line_3195	CAUSE IT HAS LESS POWDER IN IT
Line_3196	THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE SPOONFULS OF THE DRINK MIX AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS AND IS LESS COLORFUL
Line_3197	MORE IT WOULD HAVE MORE FLAVOR
Line_3198	IT WOULDN'T TASTE AS FLAVORFUL
Line_3199	IF YOU ADD MORE SOLVENT
Line_3200	THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES EXCEPT FOR THE WATER AND THE TOP RIGHT I GUESS
Line_3201	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3202	THE MIXTURE OF THE TRAIL MIX IS SEPARATING INTO DIFFERENT PILES CHOCOLATES NUTS AND RAISINS
Line_3203	THEY'RE SEPARATING
Line_3204	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT PILES
Line_3205	THE WATER IS SPLITTING FROM THE MARBLES BECAUSE THERE'S A SCREEN AND MARBLES CAN'T FIT THROUGH THOSE TINY SPACES
Line_3206	THE MARBLES SEPARATE FROM THE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN
Line_3207	IT TOOK OUT A ITEM
Line_3208	THE WATER IS NOW CLEAR
Line_3209	IT EVAPORATES
Line_3210	NO
Line_3211	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3212	MIXTURES KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOLUTIONS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3213	I HATE YOU
Line_3214	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3215	MIXTURES ARE LIKE SOLUTES
Line_3216	A SCIENCE
Line_3217	NOT SO GOOD
Line_3218	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3219	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT THE SAND IN THE WATER DIDN'T
Line_3220	THE WATER IS MIXING WITH THE GRAPETASTIC GRAPE MIX AND IT'S MIXING
Line_3221	THE SOLVENT
Line_3222	I DON'T KNOW I WANNA TALK TO YOU
Line_3223	SOLUTE IS THE SALT
Line_3224	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3225	THE SALT IT'S CALLED
Line_3226	IT IS ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE THREE OTHER ITEMS TOGETHER
Line_3227	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3228	A SOLUTE
Line_3229	TOLD YOU BEFORE IT'S A SOLVENT
Line_3230	BECAUSE THEY ARE MARNI BECAUSE THEY ARE
Line_3231	GOOD BYE MARNI
Line_3232	WE'VE BEEN DOING UH MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3233	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALAD THE PAPER CLIPS THIS WOOD AND THIS BEAN
Line_3234	THE SALAD HAS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THEM
Line_3235	THEY'RE MIXED UNLIKE THE OTHER PILES
Line_3236	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3237	THE RAISINS THE AND THE NUTS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3238	THEY USED TO BE MIXED ALTOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3239	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND COLORS
Line_3240	YOU SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3241	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE SEPARATE NOW
Line_3242	WHY ARE YOU A FLOATING HEAD ON A PEDESTAL
Line_3243	THE WATER UM IS NOW SEPARATED FROM THE SAND SO UM THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE THINGS
Line_3244	THEY GOT FILTERED DIDN'T THEY
Line_3245	YOU USED A SPECIAL TYPE OF TOOL TO FILTER THE SAND FROM THE WATER
Line_3246	THE SALT AND WATER DISSOLVES THE DIRT AND WATER DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS JUST DON'T ARE IS JUST A MIXTURE
Line_3247	IT'S DISSOLVING SO YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE SALT
Line_3248	MAYBE YOU JUST NEED I JUST NEED TO ASK A QUESTION
Line_3249	IT WAS FILTERED BY THAT BLUE FILTERING MACHINE
Line_3250	THE WATER WILL GET DISSOLVED
Line_3251	NO BECAUSE IT UM MIXED IN WITH THE WATER SO YOU'D HAVE SO YOU CAN'T
Line_3252	I DON'T KNOW MARNI TELL ME WHY
Line_3253	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODY
Line_3254	SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODY PLEASE
Line_3255	WHY'D YOU KICK ME IN THE MARBLES MARNI
Line_3256	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND THE SAND MADE THE UM AND THE SAND MADE THE A WATER VERY VERY DIRTY
Line_3257	CAN YOU REPEAT MY SENTENCE YOU KICKED ME IN THE MARBLES
Line_3258	THE SALT DISAPPEARS AND IT EVAPORATED WHILE THE SAND IT JUST SANK TO THE BOTTOM AND MADE THE WATER DIRTY
Line_3259	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT LIKE THE GRAPE STUFF UM IT LIKE THE IT
Line_3260	THE SALT DISSOLVES UNLIKE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE SAND AND WATER IT LIKE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND MAKES THE WATER ALL DIRTY I HATE YOUR FACE MARNI
Line_3261	THEY'RE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY EQUAL FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3262	THE SALT ADDED WEIGHT TO THE WATER SO NOW IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS RATHER THAN FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3263	THAT IF YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT YOU STILL ADD WEIGHT TO IT DON'T YOU
Line_3264	SOME OF THEM DISSOLVED LIKE THE SALT AND SOME OF THEM DON'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SAND
Line_3265	THEY ALL GOT MIXED TOGETHER SO NOW IT'S A WHOLE MIXTURE
Line_3266	IS GETTING LARGER BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING THREE DIFFERENT THING
Line_3267	THAT FIFTY GRAMS IS EQUAL TO ONE CUP OF UM WATER
Line_3268	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME THE ANSWER
Line_3269	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FILTER
Line_3270	THE FLOUR MIXED WITH THE WATER CAN BE FILTERED SO THE WATER AND THE FLOUR CAN BE SEPARATED AGAIN
Line_3271	THIS MEANS THAT UM IT'S STILL IN A MIXTURE SO THE SALT IS STILL IN THE WATER
Line_3272	THE CITRIC ACID COULD NOT BE FILTERED OUT
Line_3273	AFTER THE DAYS IT'S UM THE WATER DISSOLVED AND NOW THEY HAVE THESE SALT SQUARE
Line_3274	THE WATER IS GONE AND THE SALT IS STILL THERE EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T SEE IT IN THE MIXTURE
Line_3275	YOU CAN FILTER OUT THE SALT FROM THE WATER
Line_3276	THAT OVER TIME THE WATER EVAPORATES AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK IN SQUARES NOT CRYSTAL
Line_3277	THAT EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SALT AND WATER
Line_3278	IS MY UH FRIEND EPHRAIM VERY IGNORANT OR IS HE NOT A HE'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT
Line_3279	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3280	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBBLES AND WATER
Line_3281	I'D LIKE TO USE THIS ONE BECAUSE YOU IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO
Line_3282	OKAY MARNEY ARE YOU FAT
Line_3283	YOU SEPARATING THE SAND
Line_3284	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE OH MY GOSH
Line_3285	A MAGNET TO GET ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT SO FROM THE SAND AND STUFF
Line_3286	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE SAND AND WATER
Line_3287	I'M TALKING TO A WOMAN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAT
Line_3288	THIS IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE CORRECT
Line_3289	THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_3290	IS THAT THE RIGHT ONE MARNEY CAUSE I'M OH SO MAD AND YOU'RE
Line_3291	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3292	YOU USE THE COFFEE FILTER TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3293	SALT WATER DISSOLVED AND NOW IT'S JUST SALT PIECES
Line_3294	THE SALT WATER'S EVAPORATING SO THE SALT IS BACK
Line_3295	YOU PUT THE SALT WATER IN THAT THING AND NOW IT THE SALT THAT WATER DISSOLVED SO
Line_3296	ABOUT HOW EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SOLUTION
Line_3297	ARE YOU FAT OR ARE YOU NOT
Line_3298	I FEEL VERY TIRED
Line_3299	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE IN SCIENCE MARNEY
Line_3300	USING A FILTER
Line_3301	VERY TIRED
Line_3302	ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3303	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTE
Line_3304	GRAPE FANTASTIC THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED
Line_3305	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3306	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3307	THE DARKER ONE HAS THE MOST SOLUTION IN IT
Line_3308	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN BARELY SEE THROUGH THEM THE LIGHTER COLOR SOLUTIONS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM VERY EASILY
Line_3309	YOU PLAY A SONG FOR ME PLEASE
Line_3310	ONE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF LATER AND FIVE SPOON FULL AND ONE HAS FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER AND ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3311	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE UM FLAVOR HAS A LOT MORE FLAVOR THAN THE ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3312	THE ONE WITH SIX SPOONFULS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THE THE THAN THE ONE WITH THREE SPOONFUL
Line_3313	IT WOULD TASTE VERY WATERY
Line_3314	TIRED TODAY MARNI
Line_3315	I'M DOING GOOD MARNI HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_3316	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING INTERESTING IN SCIENCE
Line_3317	THE GRAPE MIX IS PURPLE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS CLEAR THE SALT IS TRANSPARENT
Line_3318	UM YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_3319	THE FEATHERS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAMS THE ROCK IS GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3320	FEATHER WEIGHS LESS THAN THE ROCK
Line_3321	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT MARNI THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3322	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS ONE HAS TEN GRAMS THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS WILL BE HEAVIER
Line_3323	THE SALT WATER LOOKS THE SAME THE GRAPE MIX ARE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_3324	THEY ARE ALL UM NOT EVEN
Line_3325	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3326	I HATE YOU MARNI SO MUCH YOU'RE KINDA CREEPY BUT YOU HELP ME WITH SCIENCE SO THANKS
Line_3327	I FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING A VERY THINGY
Line_3328	LEARNING ABOUT NUCLEAR MISSILES
Line_3329	AY SENORITA
Line_3330	IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT POWDER ON THE LEFT IS MIXED IN WITHOUT WATER
Line_3331	YOU MIX SOMETHING WITH WATER THAT MAKES A SOLUTION
Line_3332	YOU MIX THE SALT WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3333	THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT SO IT'S SETTLING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_3334	THE EROSION SALT OR EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_3335	EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM
Line_3336	THE SOLID EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM SO THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_3337	THE WATER IS SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE WATER OR SALT
Line_3338	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3339	THE SALT SOLUTION IS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS WHICH SO IT MEANS THE SALT IS SEVENTEEN GRAMS IN THERE
Line_3340	SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS OF UM SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS IS LEVEL WITH THE SOLUTION
Line_3341	GOOD I FEEL GREAT MARNI BUT MY
Line_3342	MY OBNOXIOUS FRIENDS JADEN AND EFFRAIM KEEP TALKING SO I CAN'T TELL YOU I'M SORRY MARNI
Line_3343	YOU PUT SUGAR CITRIC ACID AND EPSOM SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3344	YOU WERE MIXING THE CITRIC ACID AND EPSOM SALT TOGETHER
Line_3345	THE WATER IS SO SATURATED NONE OF NO MORE EPSOM SALT OR CITRIC ACID CAN GO IN
Line_3346	THE SUGAR IS WEIGHTS WEIGHS MORE THE EPSOM SALT AND THE CITRIC ACID
Line_3347	I GOT THE MOVES THE LIKE JAGGER I GOT A BOOBS LIKE JAGGER
Line_3348	I DON'T KNOW BUT CALL NINE ONE ONE JANE'S GONNA
Line_3349	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS MARNI BUT IT SAYS A SOLUBILITY CHART
Line_3350	IT'S ALL SATURATED BUT NOW THERE'S STILL MORE SALT LEFT OVER SO YOU HAVE TO FILTER IT
Line_3351	I THINK IT'S SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3352	IT'S CROSSING THEM OFF ON THE CRYSTALLIZATION CHART
Line_3353	THE EPSOM SALT IS LIKE
Line_3354	DUDE STOP IT
Line_3355	I THINK EPSOM SALT IS ON THE DISH
Line_3356	WHEN YOU PUT VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA TOGETHER THEY'RE UM THEY MAKE UH A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH MAKES IT ALL BUBBLY
Line_3357	THE PRODUCT
Line_3358	THEY'RE CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3359	THE CONTRACT OR SOMETHING
Line_3360	YOU MIXED ALL THEM TOGETHER
Line_3361	UM THEY'RE JUST MISSING A WATER
Line_3362	WATER WITH THE BAKING SODA IS LIKE FIZZING
Line_3363	THEY'RE BLUE WHITE AND SILVER
Line_3364	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT ATOMS
Line_3365	THE BAKING SODAS ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE VINEGAR HAS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT
Line_3366	NO THEY LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
Line_3367	MEANS THAT THEY MIX TOGETHER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3368	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3369	A MIXTURE OF BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM AND CHLORIDE
Line_3370	PRECIPITANT
Line_3371	WHEN YOU PUT SODIUM OXIDE AND FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH HYDRAULIC ACID IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_3372	WHAT ARE THE PURPLE ATOMS
Line_3373	TWO OF THEM ARE PURPLE THEY ALL USED TO BE BLUE
Line_3374	YOU CAN UM DISSOLVE IT YOU PUT IT OUT ON THE TRAY AND IT DISSOLVES SO YOU CAN FIND THE ATOM
Line_3375	UM IT GOT ALL WATERY ON THE OUTSIDE TOO
Line_3376	YOU HAD CALCIUM CHLORIDE AT THE BOTTOM
Line_3377	THE CARBONATED WATER IS SO CARBONATED THAT IT CAN'T STOP MOVING WITH THE CARBONATION
Line_3378	IT REACTED BUT IT LIKE FIZZED UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALL OF IT WAS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY FAST
Line_3379	THERE IS NO REACTION
Line_3380	IT WENT FROM RAINY TO SNOWY TO DIRTY AND THE CALENDAR FELL OFF
Line_3381	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3382	BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT MEANS IT DOES HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3383	IT'S GLOWING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
Line_3384	ONCE YOU SNAP THE STICK THE STUFF INSIDE IT MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT CAN GLOW
Line_3385	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION CAUSE IT TURNED PURPLE GOOD BYE MARNI
Line_3386	NO IT'S A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3387	YOU SUCH MARNI I HATE YOU SO MUCH
Line_3388	TIRED REALLY REALLY TIRED
Line_3389	A REACTION DIDN'T OCCUR NOTHING FIZZY HAPPENED
Line_3390	CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE BAKING SODA HAD A REACTION AND IT MADE IT FIZZ UP
Line_3391	UH DUDE AND THE SOLID IS A PRODUCT AND IT'S YELLOW
Line_3392	IT'S SIXTY GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_3393	A REACTANT PLUS A REACTANT EQUALS THE PRODUCT SO TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE EQUALS SIXTY
Line_3394	THAT THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3395	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN IS FIFTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IS SIXTY ONE
Line_3396	BECAUSE THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN LET THE GASES OUT
Line_3397	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3398	WELL THEY ARE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER IN THIS IN THESE THINGS
Line_3399	THE FIRST PILE IS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE AND THE SECOND PILE IS THREE PILES THAT ARE THE SAME TYPES
Line_3400	WELL UM IN THE LEFT PILE THERE ARE UM THE STUFF MIXED TOGETHER THE BEANS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3401	BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT APART INTO INTO GROUPS THAT ARE THE SAME TYPE
Line_3402	THEY'RE THEY'RE BRING SPLIT INTO PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME
Line_3403	INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED THEY WERE BEING SEPARATED WITH THEIR OWN KIND
Line_3404	THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER OR THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3405	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED AND AND THE UM MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3406	WELL THE SAND IS A SOLID SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH PAPER SO IT'S THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_3407	THEY SEPARATED SO NOW THE WATER IS UM UM IS PURE WATER AND THE DIRT OR THE SAND IS JUST NOW SAND
Line_3408	THE SAND AND WATER ARE BEING SEPARATED INTO INTO GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN KIND
Line_3409	THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER THE THE SAND AND DIRT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3410	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3411	OKAY UM
Line_3412	THE WATER MAKES THE SALT DISSOLVE AND THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER TO CREATE THE THE UM SOLUTION
Line_3413	THE THE IT'S BEING THE WATER'S BEING UM SEPARATED FROM THE DIRT
Line_3414	IT'S A TYPE OF MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3415	WILL BECOME PART OF THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3416	THE GRAPE JUICE PROBABLY CAN'T BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3417	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3418	THEY'RE MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT A MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3419	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND JUST SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND STAYS THERE
Line_3420	I THINK IT MIGHT BE PLAIN OR IT MIGHT BE DISSOLVED INTO THE GRAPE JUICE OR THE GRAPE JUICE MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3421	WELL I THINK THE SALT'S GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER IN THIS ONE
Line_3422	I THINK THE SOLVENT IS THE SALT CAUSE IT'S GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3423	THAT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST ADDING TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS SO THE SOLUTION IS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3424	BASICALLY JUST ADDING THEM UP
Line_3425	THAT SOLUTE THAT SOLUTIONS CAN WEIGH MORE THAN THE UM SOLVENT AND THE
Line_3426	THE MASS IS GETTING HEAVIER AND DENSER
Line_3427	IT WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE INDIVIDUAL UM UH COMPONENTS
Line_3428	THAT IT THAT IT ADDS UP
Line_3429	BY FIGURING OUT THE PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE EACH ONE
Line_3430	THAT IT MIXES WITH THE WATER AND IT STAYS IN THE WATER CAUSE IT'S
Line_3431	THAT WHEN YOU MIX A LIQUID WITH A LIQUID IT'S REALLY IT'S IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UM SEPARATE
Line_3432	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3433	IT'S EVAPORATING FROM THE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_3434	MIX A LIQUID WITH UM A WITH A SOLID THEN YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT TO TO SEPARATE IT
Line_3435	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S MAKING SALT CRYSTALS AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATED
Line_3436	THAT YOU THEY'RE MIXING THE SALT AND THE WATER AND THAT THE THEN THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND THE SALT IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS
Line_3437	SUNLIGHT AND LIGHT AND HEAT MOSTLY HEAT
Line_3438	HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR IT TO EVAPORATE
Line_3439	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3440	THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
Line_3441	IF THERE'S IF THERE'S LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE GET A ROCK OUT OF THEN YOU CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET
Line_3442	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE ROCKS OR THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3443	THAT THE ROCK CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FRESHENING UP THE WATER
Line_3444	THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER CUP
Line_3445	THE THE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES THAT THE ROCK THE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT OR WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGH AND THE ROCK AND THE PEBBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
Line_3446	THAT THE THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE SAFETY PINS
Line_3447	WELL FOR THIS ONE WE ARE USING TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_3448	A A AND A SOLUTE
Line_3449	GET SOMETHING WITH AND WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT
Line_3450	THAT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OR THE PEBBLES STAYED ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3451	BECAUSE BECAUSE OF PARTICLE SIZE TO GET THE ROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER THROUGH
Line_3452	THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE ROCK THE THE LITTLE TINY PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT
Line_3453	CAUSE THE LITTLE PEBBLES CAN'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_3454	THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE THE THE THE SAND THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE BUT THE SALTS WOULD STAY THERE
Line_3455	THAT THAT THE THE SALTS WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY
Line_3456	WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOOLS A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLUTES AND SOLVENTS
Line_3457	JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HEARD YOU SAY SOLUTIONS
Line_3458	MIXTURES AREN'T ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER
Line_3459	BY USING WATER EVAPORATION AND MAYBE MAGNETISM
Line_3460	THE PERSON'S USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT
Line_3461	YOU'RE USING A SCREEN TO SORT THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3462	THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3463	ROCKS AND THE WATER GET SEPARATED AND THE WATER GOES DOWN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP
Line_3464	BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLE SIZES SO THAT THE ROCKS
Line_3465	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE THE THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT THEY USE THE
Line_3466	CAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT TOOLS CAN HELP WITH DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3467	GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS UM ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET
Line_3468	I NOTICED THAT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM OR THE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SIEVE
Line_3469	CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SIEVE BUT THE WATER AND THE MUD CAN
Line_3470	I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3471	THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH THE FILTER BUT THE SAND CAN'T
Line_3472	MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALT WILL STAY THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND MAKE LITTLE CRYSTALS
Line_3473	I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION I THINK IT'S A MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT LITTLE BIT OF MIXTURE
Line_3474	LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TOOLS HELP WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES BYE
Line_3475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3476	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3477	CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT
Line_3478	THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3479	THE LEFT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3480	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3481	THEY GET SEPARATED
Line_3482	THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY WERE BEFORE
Line_3483	THE WATER LEAKED THROUGH THE THING AND THE MARBLE STAYED ON TOP
Line_3484	THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND THE MARBLES DIDN'T
Line_3485	THE MARBLES STAYED
Line_3486	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE SALT DISAPPEARS IN WATER
Line_3487	THE SALT DISAPPEARS
Line_3488	IT DISAPPEARS
Line_3489	WHAT
Line_3490	I'M SO GOOD
Line_3491	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3492	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3493	SALAD MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE WATER
Line_3494	BLEED BLAH BLEED
Line_3495	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS SEPARATED
Line_3496	THE RIGHT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3497	MIXTURES
Line_3498	THE
Line_3499	THEY'RE SEPARATED ALL THE
Line_3500	THE CANDY THE PEANUTS AND THE RAISINS ARE ALL IN SEPARATE PILES NOW
Line_3501	THEY'RE SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_3502	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SIFT AND THE MARBLES DID NOT
Line_3503	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_3504	THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER CAME OUT CLEAR
Line_3505	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3506	ONE EXAMPLE IS SUGAR INTO TEA AND SALT INTO WATER AND WHEN SOMETHING DISSOLVES IT USUALLY COMES BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3507	IF YOU JUST PUT IF YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3508	SOLUTION
Line_3509	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IT
Line_3510	IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET BACK BUT IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE
Line_3511	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS
Line_3512	THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
Line_3513	A MIXTURE
Line_3514	THE SAND IS A SOLUTION AND THE SALT ISN'T
Line_3515	I BELIEVE THE ROLE THE WATER PLAYING IS A SOLUTE
Line_3516	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3517	A SOLUTE
Line_3518	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_3519	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3520	GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3521	WHEN YOU ADD THE MASSES TOGETHER THEY EQUAL THE END RESULT
Line_3522	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE UM MASS OF A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION YOU GET THE ENDING MASS
Line_3523	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3524	NO MASS IS LOST OR GAINED IN THIS PROCESS
Line_3525	IT THE WEIGHT IS CONSERVED
Line_3526	CONSERVATION OF MASS
Line_3527	YOU CAN DO THAT IN A MIXTURE
Line_3528	THE SALT STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3529	IT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE WHEN WE STARTED
Line_3530	THE CITRIC ACID STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER FILTERED THROUGH
Line_3531	IT'S ACTUALLY A SOLUTION
Line_3532	YOU MIGHT USE EVAPORATION
Line_3533	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT CRYSTALS BEHIND
Line_3534	THE EVAPORATION WHEN WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES UP INTO THE SKY
Line_3535	IT GOES UP INTO THE SKY
Line_3536	TIME PASSING
Line_3537	I'M WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_3538	EVAPORATION IS ONE WAY TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3539	THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3540	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETTING EXTRACTED FROM THE DRY MIXTURE BY THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3541	MIXTURES ARE
Line_3542	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3543	YOU POUR ONE LIQUID INTO ANOTHER SOLUTE
Line_3544	ONE WATER MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN ANOTHER
Line_3545	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SOLUTION IN IT
Line_3546	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS A DARKER COLOR
Line_3547	THERE IS MORE POWDER IN THE GLASS ON THE LEFT RIGHT I MEAN I MEANT TO
Line_3548	THE MASS OF THE CONCENTRATED WATER
Line_3549	THE COLOR AND THE MASS
Line_3550	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE REST
Line_3551	BECAUSE THE LIGHTER COLORS HAS HAVE LESS CONCENTRATION IN THEM
Line_3552	MORE SUGARY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3553	IT HAS LESS FLAVORING IN IT
Line_3554	BY ADDING WATER
Line_3555	YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE SOLUTION
Line_3556	YOU TAKE AWAY SOME SOLUTION
Line_3557	BYE MARNEY
Line_3558	I'M DOING OKAY
Line_3559	SO TODAY WE WORKED ON HOW CONCENTRATED THINGS MIGHT BE LIKE HOW CONCENTRATED FRUIT PUNCH MIGHT BE
Line_3560	THE CORK IS MORE DENSE THAN THE PENNY
Line_3561	IT WILL FLOAT
Line_3562	IT SINKS
Line_3563	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOW CONCENTRATED WATER CAN GET WHEN YOU ADD CONCENTRATED POWDER
Line_3564	THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_3565	BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT STAYS TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS EVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED
Line_3566	THE LAST GRAPE DRINK MIX IS THE MORE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3567	YOU WEIGH THEM
Line_3568	NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_3569	NUMBER B I GUESS
Line_3570	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3571	WELL A MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3572	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY AND THAT'S WHY THE WATER'S CARRYING
Line_3573	AN OBJECT THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOAT INSTEAD OF SINK
Line_3574	IT'LL FLOAT
Line_3575	IT'LL SINK MARNI
Line_3576	SOLUTION A WILL BE MORE SATURATED THAN
Line_3577	IF A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT'S MORE LIKELY WHEN YOU DROP SOMETHING IT IT WILL FLOAT
Line_3578	SOLUTION B IS MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION A BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SALT INTO WATER THE SALT WON'T ALWAYS DISSOLVE
Line_3579	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3580	SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL RISE TO THE TOP
Line_3581	THE LESS DENSE WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE DENSE WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3582	IT'LL LAYER ON ON THE VERY TOP
Line_3583	ONE PUT SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM AND SOLUTION B ON THE TOP
Line_3584	BECAUSE IS ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE INCORRECT ORDER THEY'LL SINK I MEAN THEY'LL MIX
Line_3585	GOOD
Line_3586	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION IN LIQUIDS
Line_3587	THE SUGAR IS THE MOST SATURATED AND I'M GONNA KILL MASON RIGHT NOW
Line_3588	TWELVE GRAMS I MEAN SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3589	WHEN YOU EVAPORATE THE CITRIC ACID EPSOM SALT AND REGULAR SALT THE CRYSTALS MAY FORM DIFFERENT PATTER
Line_3590	GOOD BYE OH OH IT'S DANG IT IT'S ONE FIFTY I GOTTA GO BYE
Line_3591	THEY ARE SOLIDS
Line_3592	WATER AND MARBLES WATER IS A OR IS A LIQUID AND MARBLES ARE A SOLID
Line_3593	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3594	MARNI THEY SEPARATE HER NAME'S MARNI LIKE SIRI BUT IT'S MARNI THEY SEPARATE
Line_3595	THEY SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT PIECES
Line_3596	THE MARBLES STAY ON TOP OF THE STRAINER AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3597	WELL THE MARBLES ARE ON TOP OF THE STRAINER AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3598	THE SAND GOT CAUGHT IN THE SEPARATOR AND THE WATER WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH
Line_3599	THE SALAD MIXES TOGETHER WHEREAS THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS DO NOT
Line_3600	NO BECAUSE THIS UM GRAPETASTIC STUFF DISSOLVE
Line_3601	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3602	THEY WERE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TO MAKE A
Line_3603	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVE
Line_3604	A SOLUTE
Line_3605	SHE'S ON A SOLUTION
Line_3606	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3607	IT IS WATER AND IT HELPS THE THE SALT
Line_3608	THE SALTS AND THE WATER IS MIXED TOGETHER CREATING THE MASS OF THE SALT AND WATER
Line_3609	WHEN THE SALT WHICH IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WHICH IS FIFTY GRAMS ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3610	YOU USE DIFFERENT UM MATERIALS BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPERTIES THE THINGS HAVE
Line_3611	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THE WATER WENT COMPLETELY THROUGH
Line_3612	THE SOLUTE IS A MIXTURE
Line_3613	THERE WAS NO MIX THERE IS NO MIXTURE IN THE SOLUTION
Line_3614	USE THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES FOR AN ADVANTAGE
Line_3615	THE WATER AND THE SALT AND WATER SOLUTION DISSOLVED
Line_3616	IT HELPS SEPARATE THE DISSOLVED ITEMS FROM THE SOLUTE SOLVENT
Line_3617	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO GET THE ICE CRYSTALS BACK
Line_3618	THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN UM
Line_3619	THE WATER EVAPORATES AND THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT
Line_3620	THE SUNLIGHT
Line_3621	YOU CAN NOT SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE SOLVENT IN A SOLUTION UNLESS YOU EVAPORATE THE SALT
Line_3622	ONE HAS MORE CONCENTRATION THAN THE OTHER
Line_3623	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT MARNI
Line_3624	THE DARKER THE COLOR THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3625	THE DARKER HAS MORE POWDER AND THE LIGHTER HAS LESS POWDER OR
Line_3626	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3627	THEY'RE MORE DILUTED
Line_3628	IT HAS MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER
Line_3629	ONE HAS MORE GRAPE THE ONE THAT HAS MORE GRAPE POWER IS TASTES MORE LIKE UM TASTES MORE LIKE GRAPE
Line_3630	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE LIKE WATER THAN THE GRAPE FLAVORING
Line_3631	IT TASTES A LOT MORE LIKE WATER
Line_3632	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER BUT KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT AS GRAPE FANTASTIC STUFF
Line_3633	BY ADDING MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_3634	WE WERE FINDING MYSTERY MYSTERY
Line_3635	IT IS SALT AND WATER MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3636	IT IS SATURATED FULLY SATURATED
Line_3637	THE MORE SALT YOU ADD THE MORE WATER LIKE THE HIGHER THE WATER GET
Line_3638	IT MEANS THE WATER CAN NOT HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3639	AFTER THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED AND NO MORE SALT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_3640	THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED WHICH MEANS NO MORE IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3641	THE SOLUTION IS NO LONGER SOLUBLE
Line_3642	THE SUGAR IS MORE SOLUBLE THAN THE EPSOM SALT WHICH MEANS MORE SUGAR CAN DISSOLVE IN THE
Line_3643	IS NO LONGER SOLUBLE
Line_3644	THE SALT ADDS MORE MASS
Line_3645	IT TOOK FOUR SCOOPS FOR THE WATER TO COMPLETE BE COMPLETELY SATURATED WITH THE CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS TO BE
Line_3646	SUGAR IS SIX SCOOPS MORE SOLUBLE I MEAN TWO SCOOPS MORE SOLUBLE THAN CITRIC ACID
Line_3647	SUGAR IS TWO MORE SCOOPS SOLUBLE THAN FOUR THAN CITRIC ACID
Line_3648	SOME DISSOLVE MORE IN UM MORE IN WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE SOLUBLE
Line_3649	THE WATER GAINS MASS BECAUSE OF THE SALT THAT IS GOING INTO IT
Line_3650	CITRIC ACID IS THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM EPSOM SALT IS THE ONE ON THE TOP LEFT AND SALT IS THE ONE ON THE FAR RIGHT
Line_3651	I THINK IT IS EPSOM SALT
Line_3652	I THINK THEY ARE MADE OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3653	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AND THEN THE UM TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES MIXED TOGETHER TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CALLED SALT
Line_3654	THE SOLUTE MADE THE UM REACTANT REACT
Line_3655	THE SOLUTION IN THE BAG CAUSED A REACTION THAT SHOWS THAT THERE WAS C O OR CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE BAG
Line_3656	AND THE BAKING SODA AND THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE THE BAKING SODA HAS IS DENSER THAN THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3657	I SEE WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3658	THE MOLECULES TOOK AND REARRANGED THEMSELVES TO CREATE A NEW PRODUCT
Line_3659	OKAY
Line_3660	A REALLY BAD A REALLY BAD SALAD
Line_3661	SALAD TRAIL MIX UH CLIPPERS NO PAPER CLIPS WATER
Line_3662	SALAD AND WATER
Line_3663	HI MARNI
Line_3664	I DON'T CARE
Line_3665	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
Line_3666	STOP REPEATING EVERYTHING YOU SAY STOP KICKING ME IN THE MARBLES NOT MARNI I'M CONFUSED
Line_3667	WHY IS THIS EVEN IMPORTANT MARNI PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME AND YOU HAVE A CHICK STASH YOU LOOK SO WEIRD
Line_3668	AH GROSS MARNI YOU FARTED
Line_3669	THIS THING'S GONNA GLITCH ALRIGHT UM YOU ADDED WATER TO A CUP WHOOP DEE BORING DOO
Line_3670	TODAY IS GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL DAY CAUSE I GOT IN THE SHOWER FIRST
Line_3671	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT MARNI
Line_3672	UM WHEN YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER IT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3673	LA LA LA LA
Line_3674	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3675	THE SALT IS THE SALT
Line_3676	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CAUSE IT DISAPPEARS DISSOLVING MEANS DISAPPEARING
Line_3677	ATTEMPTING TO MAKE THE WATER DIFFERENT
Line_3678	REPEAT MARNI SERIOUSLY
Line_3679	HMMM THE SALT DISSOLVED MARNI B B C B B N B B V
Line_3680	MY IGNORANT FRIEND CADE OVER THERE IS JUST BEING AN IGNORANT
Line_3681	DO YOU THINK CADE NEEDS TO TAKE A BATH
Line_3682	IT'S DARK IN HERE I'M SCARED
Line_3683	MARIE I'M AWAKE AND HEALTHY
Line_3684	WHY SHOULD I YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A COMPUTER PROGRAM YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING SUCKER
Line_3685	YOU ACTUALLY SPOKE INTO HER YOU LITTLE
Line_3686	THE SALT IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND IT'S CALLED EROSION AND IT DISSOLVED
Line_3687	UM YOU'RE CREEPY
Line_3688	ADD THE GRAPE TO THE WATER MARNI I'M NOT STUPID
Line_3689	YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER AND IT MAKES EROSION
Line_3690	SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A PACK OF EGGS
Line_3691	RICKY JOHN JONES RICKY JOHN JONES RICKY JOHN JOHN JOHN JOHN JOHN
Line_3692	UM IT'S BEING ADDED INTO TRAIL MIX
Line_3693	ALRIGHT UM THE SCREEN IS BLACK MARNI
Line_3694	IT'S EVAPORATED INTO SOLUTION
Line_3695	GRAMS ARE BEING ADDED YOU HAVE TO EVEN OUT THE THE GRAMS TO HAVE IT EQUAL
Line_3696	HEY THERE MARNI
Line_3697	UH GRAVEL UH TOOTH PICKS AND AND PAPER CLIPS YOU USE THE MAGNETS TO SEPARATE THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE GRAVEL AND TOOTH PICKS
Line_3698	THE PROPERTIES OF I DON'T CARE
Line_3699	UM IT'S KINDA DARK MARNI SO CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW ME AN ANIMATION
Line_3700	THAT
Line_3701	MAGNETISM I SAID THAT ALREADY GOSH
Line_3702	THE ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3703	CAUSE YOU CAN'T USE WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE JAR MARNI
Line_3704	YOU USE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE THE PAPER
Line_3705	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MADE OF METAL AND THE MAGNETS PICK UP
Line_3706	I DON'T CARE
Line_3707	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_3708	CAUSE THE FILTER ONLY LETS WATER COME THROUGH IT AND NOT GRAVEL
Line_3709	I DON'T CARE PLEASE LET ME LIVE I'M BEGGING YOU WHY ARE YOU SAYING MALFUNCTION
Line_3710	I DON'T KNOW WHY IS THERE A CLOCK
Line_3711	A MIXTURE IS BEING MADE THERE'S A DARK AND A LIGHT THE LIGHT TASTES LIKE WATER AND THE DARK TASTES LIKE GRAPE
Line_3712	A SOLUTION
Line_3713	I DON'T KNOW MARNI PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_3714	THE LIGHT CUP HAS TWENTY FIVE GRAMS AND THE DARK CUP HAS SEVENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3715	ONE'S PURPLE AND THE OTHER ONE IS PURPLE
Line_3716	EVAPORATION
Line_3717	EXCUSE ME COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_3718	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU TODAY MARNI
Line_3719	EVAPORATION AND MIXTURE
Line_3720	YES A FEATHER WEIGHS TWO OUNCES AND A ROCK WEIGHS THREE POUNDS
Line_3721	CADE AND EFFRAIM WEIGH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
Line_3722	NINETY GRAMS IS HEAVIER THAN TWO GRAMS
Line_3723	THE TWENTY GRAMS THE TWENTY GRAMS WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE TWENTY IS BIGGER THAN TEN FOR
Line_3724	MY FRIEND CADE THINKS YOU'RE HOT
Line_3725	IS CADE HORRIBLE AT MINE CRAFT
Line_3726	THERE IS MORE GRAMS OF GRAPE GRAPE MIXTURE IN THE THIRD GLASS
Line_3727	HEY MARNI ARE YOU GREAT AT MINE CRAFT CAUSE I KNOW NOT
Line_3728	GOOD KADE CAN'T GET A GIRL FRIEND AS USUAL AND I THINK HE'S GAINING WEIGHT
Line_3729	GOOD CADE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A GIRL FRIEND OBVIOUSLY AND YOU'RE STILL WEIRD
Line_3730	WE WERE DOING WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT RAINBOWS IN A TUBE
Line_3731	SHOW ME AN ANIMATION
Line_3732	THE
Line_3733	I DON'T KNOW WELL YOU'RE HERE WELL ACTUALLY THE PENNY IS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK WHICH MAKES THE CORK FLOAT SO THE PENNY SINKS
Line_3734	THE THE SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3735	ONE WOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3736	HEY HEY MARNI HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU HOT STUFF YOU'RE A PROGRAM
Line_3737	WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS
Line_3738	I SAY YOU SHOULD JUMP INTO THAT CUP AND DROWN YOURSELF YOU'RE UGLY
Line_3739	THEY FLOAT TO THE TOP AND THE CONCENTRATED UM SOLUTION B SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3740	THE LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3741	I'M A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL IN CYBER
Line_3742	IT WILL FLOAT TO THE TOP
Line_3743	THEY ALL MIX SO NOW IT'S ONE BIG SOLUTION B
Line_3744	THE MORE DENSE SOLUTION
Line_3745	REPEAT REPEAT
Line_3746	OKAY BYE LOG OFF
Line_3747	WHAT THE
Line_3748	REPEAT
Line_3749	WOULD YOU REPEAT THAT MARNI MY IDIOTIC FRIEND
Line_3750	WE'RE LEARNING ON DISSOLVING WHERE'S IT COMING FROM
Line_3751	YOU'RE DISSOLVING IT
Line_3752	MARNI I'M SORRY BUT MY FRIENDS ARE COMPLAINING WHAT IS YOUR DEAL
Line_3753	IT IS BEING DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER BUT ALSO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE CAUSE THERE ARE STILL SALT PARTICLES LEFT
Line_3754	YOU'RE TRYING TO
Line_3755	YOU HAVE TO MIX THE SALT SOLUTION WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER DANG IT MARNI YOU INTERRUPTED MY SESSION
Line_3756	STOP SERIOUSLY STOP
Line_3757	THE SUGAR WEIGHS MORE THAN THE CITRIC ACID AND THE
Line_3758	THE MASS OF THE WEIGHTS IS LESS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3759	IT'S SALT
Line_3760	IT'S CITRIC ACID
Line_3761	THE CHEMICALS OF BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED AND IT CREATED A CHEMICAL THAT MADE A REACTION TO MAKE IT FIZZ
Line_3762	A REACTION CALLED A A OR A SOLUTION
Line_3763	A SOLUTION I SAID THAT
Line_3764	MIXTURES OF OF UM UM UM UM KYLE HELP ME OUT HERE
Line_3765	AIR IS INSIDE THE BAG AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR YOU HARDLY CAN SEE IT
Line_3766	THEY'RE JUST STUFF MIXED TOGETHER BUT THEY KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3767	CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3768	CAN WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3769	IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEY KEEP OH MY
Line_3770	ACTUALLY WE WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND NOT
Line_3771	WELL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_3772	UM SO THE SAND IS GOING INTO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS GOING INTO THE TO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS DISSOLVING
Line_3773	UM THE SALT UM DISSOLVED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SALT IS A DISSOLVING MATERIAL
Line_3774	THE WATER IS PLAIN UM AND THE GRAPE IT THE GRAPETASTIC THING IS PLAIN THE SALT
Line_3775	UM NAME FOR THE WATER IS A SOLVENT
Line_3776	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3777	WE CALL THAT SOLVENT
Line_3778	I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU PLUS WATER WITH SALT IT EQUALS SALT WATER AND SALT WATER WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN WATER CAUSE IT HAS THE SALT IN
Line_3779	IT TELLS ME THAT ALL THEM THE WEIGHTS STAY THE SAME IN THE PROPERTIES CHART
Line_3780	THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD A MATERIAL TOGETHER UM YOUR PRODUCT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAME
Line_3781	IT'S NOT THE SAME THE OKAY OKAY YOU ARE SO
Line_3782	THE MASS UM INCREASES BY FIFTEEN
Line_3783	THAT IT IS A CORRECT ADDITION PROBLEM
Line_3784	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_3785	THIS MEANS THAT THE I MEAN SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3786	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3787	IT'S ACTUALLY A MIXTURE
Line_3788	YOU CAN ONLY UM GET IT OUT IN A MIXTURE BUT YOU CAN IN A SOLUTION IF IF IT'S LIKE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT
Line_3789	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
Line_3790	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3791	IT'S EVAPORATING SO YOU CAN SEE THE SALT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3792	IT IS EVAPORATING I TOLD YOU SEVERAL TIMES
Line_3793	YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT INSTEAD
Line_3794	BYE YOU HAVE A NICE DAY TOO
Line_3795	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_3796	WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE BY USING MAGNETISM
Line_3797	YOU COULD USE DENSITY MAGNETISM
Line_3798	WELL THE MIXTURE IS WITH GRAVEL AND WATER BUT WHEN YOU POUR IT THROUGH A SCREEN ONLY THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE GRAVEL STAYS ON THE SCREEN
Line_3799	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE PROPERTY SIZE OF WATER
Line_3800	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PARTICLE SIZE
Line_3801	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_3802	IT WAS PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM
Line_3803	PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3804	BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLIDS
Line_3805	BECAUSE WATER WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE THING AND ONLY THE PAPER CLIPS WOULD STICK TO THAT SO THAT'S AN EXCELLENT WAY TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_3806	BECAUSE ALL MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_3807	BECAUSE MAGNET HAS MAGNETISM AND PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_3808	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIGGER SIZE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3809	BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES CAN GO THROUGH BUT THE BIG ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3810	YOU USED A FILTER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE CAUSE YOU USED IT WITH A SCREEN I DON'T KNOW WAIT I DON'T KNOW
Line_3811	CAN WE PLEASE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
Line_3812	THAT YOU'RE SEPARATING THE
Line_3813	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3814	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS EASY YEAH
Line_3815	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SALT SOLUTION
Line_3816	YOU'RE USING GRAPE JUICE AND UM AND THERE'S ONE MORE CONCENTRATED AND ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3817	YOU CAN TELL IT BY WEIGHING IT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED OR ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3818	UM YOU CAN DETERMINE THEM BY WHICH IS MORE MORE CONCENTRATED AND WHICH IS MORE DILUTE
Line_3819	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3820	THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGHTER COLORS AND THE LIGHTER COLORS ARE MORE DILUTE
Line_3821	THE ONE WILL LESS GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE BORING AND THE ONE WITH MORE WILL TASTE MORE GRAPE CAUSE IT HAS MORE GRAPE FANTASTIC
Line_3822	IT WOULD TASTE MORE WATERY
Line_3823	IT'S DIFFERENT CAUSE ONE IS MORE STRONGER AND IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED AND THAT MAKES IT STRONG AND THE ONES THAT'S MORE DILUTE IS NOT STRONG
Line_3824	I'M GOOD
Line_3825	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3826	WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT
Line_3827	WELL ONE CAN BE SATURATED
Line_3828	ONE GETS SATURATED FASTER
Line_3829	THAT'S KINDA WHAT I JUST SAID
Line_3830	UM KIND OF ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT
Line_3831	THEY'RE TRYING TO SATURATE
Line_3832	BY SEEING HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SATURATED
Line_3833	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN
Line_3834	I DON'T KNOW CAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN I THINK IT'S SALT THOUGH
Line_3835	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN PLEASE
Line_3836	WELL YOU CAN UM EVAPORATE IT AND THEN IT
Line_3837	EPSOM SALT
Line_3838	WE'VE BEEN DOING CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA WELL CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3839	THAT'S CALLED A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3840	TWO SOLUTE
Line_3841	THAT THOSE TWO THINGS MAKE SALT
Line_3842	WE MIX TWO SOLUTES TOGETHER AND THE PUT EM IN A SOLVENT AND THEY MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3843	THOSE TWO CHEMICALS MAKE UM WHATEVER THAT IS WELL THEY MIX TOGETHER AND THEN
Line_3844	IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3845	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_3846	THAT ONE IS GREATER AND ONE'S LESS AND WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER TWO FOUR POINT TWO
Line_3847	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPENED LET OUT GAS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED SEALED THE GAS
Line_3848	LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3849	THERE'S A SALAD MARBLES TRAIL MIX PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS
Line_3850	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED TOGETHER WITH ALL THREE THINGS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_3851	THEY GET SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COULD
Line_3852	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM A
Line_3853	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE
Line_3854	THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3855	WE MADE A SOLUTION BY USING A FILTER AND THE FILTER SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3856	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER MIND
Line_3857	THE SALT SEPARATE NEVER MIND
Line_3858	THAT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT MIXES INTO THE WATER AND THEY BECOME ONE JUST SALT
Line_3859	THE SALT DISAPPEARS THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE TO FORM TO FORM THE OCEAN
Line_3860	BECAUSE THE SALT AND THE GRAPETASTIC MIXED WITH EACH OTHER AND MADE A
Line_3861	WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT IT MARNEY
Line_3862	IT'S A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING COMING TOGETHER
Line_3863	THAT'S A MIXTURE AND THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3864	THEY GOT SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT'S A
Line_3865	THE GRID SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE
Line_3866	THE COFFEE FILTER HELD THE SAND BUT LET GO OF THE WATER
Line_3867	THE FILTER STOPPED THE SAND FROM
Line_3868	THE ONE MINUTE MARNEY PLEASE I LOVE YOU BABE
Line_3869	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE REST ARE MIXTURES
Line_3870	THE SALT DISAPPEARED IN THE WATER AND IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3871	THAT'S A SOLUTION OKAY WHAT THE HECK WE'RE DONE
Line_3872	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY WHAT ADAM DID IS HE KEPT SAYING AND HE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING
Line_3873	THE DIFFERENCE FROM A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3874	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND
Line_3875	THE WATER PLUS THE SAND EQUALS SAND WATER AND THEN THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT
Line_3876	WHAT'S A MIXTURE AND WHAT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3877	THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS JUST IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEN THE SALT AND WATER IS A UM SOLUTION
Line_3878	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER WHICH IS A SOLUTION
Line_3879	THE GRAPETASTIC IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER SO THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_3880	THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_3881	THAT GRAMS PLUS GRAMS EQUALS GRAM
Line_3882	A CANDY PLUS RAISINS PLUS PEANUTS EQUALS A MIXTURE OF FIFTY GRAM
Line_3883	THREE CUBES PLUS WATER EQUALS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MASS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME HEAVINESS
Line_3884	GRAMS PLUS GRAMS EQUALS GRAMS
Line_3885	THAT WATER PLUS FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT
Line_3886	USING A COFFEE FILTER
Line_3887	THAT MEANS IT'S A MIXTURE MARNI
Line_3888	A MIX OR A SOLUTION
Line_3889	YOU'RE MIXING SALT AND WATER TO GET A SOLUTION
Line_3890	THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT STAYED THE SAME AND MADE IT
Line_3891	USE A PETRI DISH TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THE SALT TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THE WATER JUST
Line_3892	THE SALT IS LEFT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE
Line_3893	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT JUST STAYED ON THE PETRI DISH BECAUSE IT'S A SOLID NOT A
Line_3894	WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES OR SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3895	BUT BYE
Line_3896	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3897	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING WHEN YOU TAKE TWO OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUT IT TOGETHER
Line_3898	YOU'RE FILTERING THE ROCKS OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3899	SO THAT YOU COULD GET THE SOLIDS OUT FROM THE LIQUID
Line_3900	A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION
Line_3901	TO GET THE PEBBLES OUT OF THE SAND WATER
Line_3902	BECAUSE THEY'RE A MAGNET ATTRACTS OTHER METAL THINGS TO ATTACH TO IT
Line_3903	TO SEPARATE SOLIDS FROM LIQUIDS
Line_3904	YOU FILTER IT TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST STUCK TO THE WATER TO GET OUT WITH THE
Line_3905	WE USED A FILTER TO SEPARATE UM SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SMALL FROM THE WATER TO THE
Line_3906	THE LAST ONE IS THE BEST TO MAKE
Line_3907	BYE BUT BYE BYE SEE YA BYE
Line_3908	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3909	YOU CAN GET SALT AND WATER AND THEN MIX THEM AND IT'LL ALMOST LOOK LIKE THE SALT DISAPPEARED BUT IT DIDN'T
Line_3910	IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3911	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_3912	THERE'S MORE OF WHICH IN ONE THAN THE
Line_3913	A GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_3914	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_3915	YOU CAN TELL BY WEIGHING IT FROM IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER
Line_3916	THAT ONE IS HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_3917	THAT ONE HAS
Line_3918	UH THIS COMPUTER AWFULLY HUGE
Line_3919	I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH A BALANCE
Line_3920	THE ROCK HAS MORE MASS THAN THE FEATHER SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3921	ONE IS MORE DILUTED THAN THE OTHER
Line_3922	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTION THAN THE OTHER
Line_3923	IT WOULD BALANCE OUT THE SAME
Line_3924	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER
Line_3925	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ONE EACH ONE IS DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3926	THREE AND TWO ARE THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER
Line_3927	NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3928	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3929	NUMBER IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3930	THAT MEANS IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE HEAVIER SOLUTION
Line_3931	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SALT
Line_3932	BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS HEAVIER THAN SOLUTION A
Line_3933	YOU CAN TELL IT BY HOW DENSE EACH ONE IS TWELVE IS TWELVE
Line_3934	THE DENSER ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BLUE CAN HOLD UP THE GREEN AND THE
Line_3935	YOU ARE MIXING MORE GRAPE GRAPE WITH WATER
Line_3936	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS FIVE OF THEM FIVE OF THEM
Line_3937	WE WEIGHED IT
Line_3938	YOU WEIGHED IT AND THE ONE WITH THE WITH THE MOST IS CONCENTRATED I THINK
Line_3939	HOW MUCH SPOONS HOW MUCH SPOONFULS YOU HAVE
Line_3940	THEY TASTE GOOD
Line_3941	I DON'T KNOW OKAY
Line_3942	THE LEFT HAS LESS
Line_3943	BETTER THAN THE RIGHT
Line_3944	IT WOULD TASTE WORSE CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE WATER OKAY
Line_3945	IT IT IT WON'T TASTE THAT GOOD
Line_3946	YOU CAN TAKE THE WATER OUT
Line_3947	PLEASE PLEASE CAN WE JUST MOVE ON
Line_3948	THE MOON SUN AND PLANETS
Line_3949	HALF OF THE EARTH IS IN THE DAY OR THE LIGHT AND HALF OF THE EARTH IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS THE DARK
Line_3950	IT'S SIMILAR TO THE EARTH ROTATING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3951	THE SUN ROTATING
Line_3952	THE AXIS THAT THE EARTH IS ROTATING ON
Line_3953	T'S MORNING IN THE EAST AND NIGHT IN THE WEST
Line_3954	THE SUN AND THE EARTH AND NORTH AMERICA
Line_3955	THE EARTH IS SPINNING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3956	THE ANIMATION SHOWS ME THAT THE EARTH IS ACTUALLY MOVING AROUND THE SUN INSTEAD OF THE SUN MOVING AROUND THE EARTH
Line_3957	IS THE SAME ANIMATION BUT IT'S MOVED IN A DIFFERENT SPOT
Line_3958	A YEAR GOES WHEN THE SUN WHEN THE EARTH MOVES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE SUN TO THE SAME SPOT IT WAS IN
Line_3959	A CAR IS A SYSTEM HAS WHEELS A CHAIR AND ENGINES AND OTHER STUFF
Line_3960	THE ENGINE IS CONNECTED TO THE WHEELS SO THE WHEELS WILL MOVE THE CAR AND IT'S ALSO CONNECTED TO THE
Line_3961	ALL OF THE PARTS THAT MAKE IT MOVE LIKE THE WHEELS AND THE AXLE AND THE EXHAUST AND THE ENGINE
Line_3962	THE WHEELS THE ENGINE AND EVERYTHING AND THEN UM ENGINE MAKES THE WHEELS MOVE SO THE CAR WILL MOVE AND DRIVE
Line_3963	A HUMAN IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS LIKE THE LUNGS THE HEART THE INTESTINES THE KIDNEY
Line_3964	IT SHOWS SOME OF THE SUBSYSTEM IT SHOWS SOME OF THE SUBSYSTEMS IN THE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3965	ALL THE BLOOD VEINS
Line_3966	THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS A BIG SYSTEM WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS
Line_3967	A TRAIN
Line_3968	EARTH IS A BIG SUBSYSTEM AND IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF MOVING PARTS
Line_3969	WELL THE EARTH IS A BIG SUBSYSTEMS WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE THE BIOSPHERE AND THE ATMOSPHERE AND OTHER SPHERE
Line_3970	YES THE EARTH HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SYSTEMS LIKE THE BIOSPHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IT HAS CARS COMPUTERS US
Line_3971	WE'RE SUBSYSTEMS ON TOP OF THE BIG SYSTEM EARTH
Line_3972	THESE SUBSYSTEMS ARE PART OF THE EARTH
Line_3973	FOUR OF THEM ONE OF THEM CALLED THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OTHER ONE IS THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CALLED THE BIOSPHERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE CALLED YEAH
Line_3974	OH THE WATER AND THE FISH IN THERE AND THE CORAL AND ALL THE ORGANISMS THAT LIVE DOWN IN THE SEA
Line_3975	THE SPHERE IS MAINLY MADE UP OF WATER YEAH
Line_3976	IN THE FOREST AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3977	THE UM THE DESERT HAS DIFFERENT ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND THE WET AREAS HAVE FISH CORAL AND OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_3978	I THINK IT'S MADE UP OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND OTHER WATERS STUFF
Line_3979	I THINK THE ECOSYSTEM IS THE BIG THING AND THE BIOSPHERE IS THE SUBSYSTEM
Line_3980	IT'S A FOOD CHAIN OF ALL THE FOOD YEAH
Line_3981	IT'S A FOOD CYCLE YEAH
Line_3982	THAT THEY ALL MATCH UP TOGETHER SOMEHOW
Line_3983	ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE SO THEY GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CYCLE UNTIL THEY COME BACK TO POINT A
Line_3984	IT SHOWS ALL THE ANIMALS EATS TO ALL THE WAY UNTIL THEY GET BACK TO THE END SO THEY CAN START A
Line_3985	MATCHING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN SO AND THAT'S A CYCLE HOW THEY EAT EACH OTHER AND EFFECT EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER UNTIL IT GETS BACK TO POINT A
Line_3986	THAT THEY WOULD ALL MATCH UP AND BE ABLE TO EAT EACH OTHER
Line_3987	THEY ALL ARE LIVING ORGANISMS
Line_3988	I'M DOING OKAY
Line_3989	WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PATTERNS IN THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3990	WE WERE SEEING IF YEAST LIKED FOUR OR SUGAR MORE
Line_3991	I THINK THIS SHOWS LIKE UHM HOW YEAST RELEASES GAS AS IT EATS
Line_3992	IT'S SHOWING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT WHEN YEAST EATS WHEN YEAST EAT
Line_3993	THAT YEAST IS SINGLE CELLED AND DOESN'T HAVE A MOUTH OR ANYTHING
Line_3994	WE WERE GROWING TO SEE HOW IT HOW IT IS AFFECTED BY HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAS
Line_3995	ONE WAS NOT PUT INTO LIGHT OS IT DIDN'T GET THE SAME NUTRIENTS AS THE HEALTHY ONE
Line_3996	WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PLANT AND WHAT IT NEEDS TO GROW AND HOW IT GROWS
Line_3997	THE PICTURE SHOWS IT NEEDS SOIL LIGHT AND WATER
Line_3998	I THINK THIS PLANT DOES BECAUSE MOST PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3999	I THINK THAT THIS PICTURE SHOW THAT ALL PLANTS NEED OXYGEN OR SOME FORM OF AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_4000	I THINK THAT THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4001	I THINK THAT THIS SHOWS THAT THE PLANTS NEED SOME FROM OF FOOD OR MAYBE SOME FORM OF NUTRIENTS
Line_4002	THAT THEIR FOOD IN A WAY IS LIQUID SO IT CAN MOVE THROUGHOUT THE CELLS
Line_4003	IT SHOWS A HOME BUT PLANTS DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A HOME
Line_4004	THEY COLLECT SUNLIGHT AND THEY TRANSFER THAT AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SUGAR WHICH THEY PRESS THROUGH THE CELLS THIS IS CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Line_4005	THIS MAYBE SHOWS THAT THE PLANT DIDN'T GET ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO MAKE ITS FOOD SO IT DIDN'T SURVIVE
Line_4006	WELL THERE'S A THING IN LEAVES CALLED CHLOROPHYLL AND ABSORBS THE SUNLIGHT AND REFLECTS OFF GREEN MEANING THIS DIDN'T GET ANY SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN'T REFLECT OFF GREEN
Line_4007	I DON'T THINK THIS PLANT HAS GOTTEN ANY OXYGEN
Line_4008	IT DIDN'T LET IT SAY BREATHE MEANING IT COULDN'T GET ANY AIR INTO ITS LEAVES OR LET IT FLOW THROUGHOUT
Line_4009	THIS PLANT HAS EVERYTHING THAT IT NEEDS BUT WATER WHICH HELPS
Line_4010	THE PLANT HASN'T BEEN GETTING ANY WATER MEANING NONE OF ITS FOOD CAN MOVE THROUGHOUT ITS BODY
Line_4011	THE PLANT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS IT HAS THE WATER TO HELP EVERYTHING MOVE OUT THE SUN SO IT CAN GET ITS ENERGY AND THE OXYGEN SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT
Line_4012	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY CAN LEAD UP TO OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT NEED TO EAT THESE PRODUCERS IT ALSO SHOWS
Line_4013	TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS AND THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY ALSO NEED MANY TYPES OF THINGS LIKE WATER OXYGEN AND LIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4014	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS
Line_4015	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CELLS AND WE DID A YEAST EXPERIMENT A FEW TIMES AGO
Line_4016	IT SHOWS DIFFERENT CELLS AND HOW THEY'RE GROUPED
Line_4017	PLANT CELLS ARE LAYERED DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HUMAN CELLS
Line_4018	THIS ONLY SHOWS ONE SECTION AS DOES IT WITH HUMANS
Line_4019	THAT THEY'RE SHOWING A TYPE OF CELL AND A PART OF A LEG
Line_4020	THEY'RE VERY LONG ENOUGH TO BE GROUPED TOGETHER OR WE WOULDN'T HAVE A MUSCLE
Line_4021	I THINK THIS SHOWS NERVES IN THE BRAIN
Line_4022	IT'S SHOWING ME BRAIN CELLS
Line_4023	I THINK THIS SHOWS ANOTHER PART OF AN ARM SOME CELLS
Line_4024	THESE CELLS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY MAKE UP A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BODY
Line_4025	WE'RE MADE OF MANY CELLS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS EVEN
Line_4026	THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS OF CELLS AND THERE'S A LOT
Line_4027	I THINK MAYBE THE HUMAN HAS MORE CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MAKE UP A LARGER THING
Line_4028	IT SHOWS A BUTTERFLY WHICH MAY BE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AS WE ARE
Line_4029	IT SHOWS A BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AS WELL AS A HUMAN
Line_4030	THEY BOTH HAVE A STOMACH AND A WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEIR WASTE
Line_4031	PERHAPS WHERE THE UHM DIGESTIVE SYSTEM STARTS
Line_4032	IT CHEWS AND BREAKS DOWN FOODS BEFORE IT HEADS DOWN TO THE ESOPHAGUS
Line_4033	IT PUSHES DOWN FOOD INTO THE STOMACH WITH SOME STRONG MUSCLES
Line_4034	I KNOW THAT THIS IS VITAL SO THE CHEWED UP FOOD CAN GET INTO THE STOMACH AND SO CAN SO THE FOOD CAN BE BREAK DOWN EVEN FURTHER
Line_4035	THE SMALL INTESTINE REMOVES NUTRIENTS WHILE THE LARGE INTESTINE REMOVES MOISTURE
Line_4036	THEY'RE THE LONGEST PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_4037	EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VASCULAR SYSTEM IN PLANTS
Line_4038	IT'S IT HAS PARALLEL VEINS
Line_4039	MAPLE LEAF IT COULD BE A MAPLE LEAF
Line_4040	PALMATE IT HAS PALMATE VEINS
Line_4041	LEAF HAS PENNY VEINS
Line_4042	I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR CARRYING NUTRIENTS AROUND
Line_4043	I THINK THIS SHOWS WHAT PLANTS NEED TO MAKE FOOD
Line_4044	I THINK THE NUTRIENTS AND WATER AND FOOD TRAVEL THROUGH THE VEINS ON LEAVES
Line_4045	I THINK THIS IS SHOWING WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAF
Line_4046	I THINK IT TRANSPORTS FLUID AND OXYGEN LIKE THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IN HUMANS
Line_4047	IT SHOWS WATER BEING RELEASED FROM LEAVE
Line_4048	COVERING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN SCIENCE
Line_4049	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4050	I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4051	I CAN SEE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT
Line_4052	THIS SHOWS HOW AIR GETS INTO THE LUNGS AND HOW IT GETS OUT OF THE LUNGS
Line_4053	BREATHING HELPS US GET OXYGEN IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE OUT
Line_4054	IT COMES IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND NOSE AND IS FILTERED
Line_4055	INHALING IS BRINGING IN EXHALING IS SENDING OUT
Line_4056	I THINK THE MAIN ORGAN IS THE LUNG
Line_4057	WHEN IT MOVES IT EITHER CAUSES LOW PRESSURE OR HIGH PRESSURE TO GET AIR IN OR OUT
Line_4058	OXYGEN GETTING INTO OUR BLOOD AND CARBON DIOXIDE GETTING OUT
Line_4059	SO WE DON'T HAVE RANDOM GASSES IN OUR BLOOD
Line_4060	AIR IS DRAGGED IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE AND IT IS BROUGHT DOWN THROUGH THE TRACHEA
Line_4061	THE DIAPHRAGM DOES ALL THE WORK BY RETRACTING AND EXPANDING
Line_4062	NOTHING MUCH
Line_4063	BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_4064	BECAUSE OF HOW ALL THE SYSTEM THE A CAR HAS WITH OTHER THING
Line_4065	BECAUSE HUMAN BODIES ARE SYSTEMS TOO
Line_4066	BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IT HAS
Line_4067	BECAUSE OF HOW IT HAS LIKE THE UH THE ARMS THE HEAD THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTS
Line_4068	REPEAT REPEAT THE QUESTION
Line_4069	BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND LAND
Line_4070	REPEAT THE QUESTION PLEASE
Line_4071	IT SHOWS THE LAYERS AND THE LITTLE HILL AND SHOWS LIKE ALL THE STUFF UNDERWATER AND BUILDINGS
Line_4072	THERE ARE FOUR
Line_4073	BIOSPHERE'S ALL ABOUT LIKE ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND BIRDS THAT ARE ON LIVING ON EARTH
Line_4074	I DON'T GET THAT QUESTION
Line_4075	IT'S JUST LIKE UH THE FOOD CHAIN
Line_4076	BECAUSE WHEN LIKE A BEAR EATS A FISH A FISH EATS A SMALLER FISH
Line_4077	SAY THAT QUESTION AGAIN I DIDN'T HEAR YOU VERY GOOD
Line_4078	THE TWO PARTS THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE
Line_4079	HAWK AND SNAKE
Line_4080	SAY THE EXACT QUESTION YOU JUST SAID YOU'RE A SPEAKING ROBOT
Line_4081	IT'S ALL A SYSTEM
Line_4082	BECAUSE ALL THE PICTURES THAT YOU'RE SHOWING ARE A SYSTEM
Line_4083	BECAUSE A CAR IS A SYSTEM
Line_4084	BECAUSE THESE SYSTEMS ARE A SUBSYSTEM OR A SYSTEM
Line_4085	BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4086	BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM WITH A BUNCH OF BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4087	BECAUSE IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS LOTS OF OTHER LOTS OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4088	DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_4089	REPEAT THE STINKING QUESTION
Line_4090	THEY BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND
Line_4091	THAT THE HEART IS ONE GIANT SYSTEM
Line_4092	ALL THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS THAT IS INSIDE OF YOU YOU NEED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4093	CELLS ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE BODY
Line_4094	THE BLUE PART ARE CELLS
Line_4095	BECAUSE IT IS ONE A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_4096	BLOOD BLOOD HEART AND YOUR BLOOD CELLS
Line_4097	IT PUMPS BLOOD SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4098	THEY ARE THE BLOOD IT BLOOD VESSELS ARE BLOOD THAT GOES IN YOUR HEART AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4099	UM LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
Line_4100	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4101	IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4102	UM IT HAS A SUBSYSTEM AND A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4103	THEY ARE SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4104	UM ALL OF THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4105	BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND THERE ARE A FEW SUBSYSTEMS IN THERE
Line_4106	IT IS A SUBSYSTEM IN THE UNIVERSE AND IT CAN BE A SYSTEM OF ITS OWN I GUESS
Line_4107	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4108	THERE ARE THREE THERE IS THE ATMOSPHERE HYDROSPHERE AND THE I FORGOT THE LAST ONE
Line_4109	THEY ARE PART
Line_4110	I THINK THIS IS A FOOD WEB A FOOD WEB
Line_4111	WELL THE EVERYTHING GOES TO THE BACTERIA AND FUNGUS WHEN IT DIES
Line_4112	UHM SYSTEMS
Line_4113	THEY ARE ALL PART OF A FOOD WEB
Line_4114	I MAKES ITS OWN FOOD FROM THE SUN
Line_4115	THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER ORGANISMS THEY MAKES SUGAR FROM THE SUN WATER AND OXYGEN
Line_4116	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_4117	FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_4118	THE RABBIT THE LIZARD THE BEETLE THE BLUE JAY THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE
Line_4119	DECOMPOSING OTHER ORGANISMS OTHER DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4120	BACTERIA AND FUNGI ARE DECOMPOSERS
Line_4121	A PRODUCER IS MISSING
Line_4122	FUNGI
Line_4123	THE MISSING ORGANISM IS FUNGI
Line_4124	A PRODUCER IS MISSING HERE
Line_4125	UHM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4126	UHM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4127	TO EAT MEAT AND TO EAT PLANTS
Line_4128	CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_4129	OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_4130	A BEAR IS A OMNIVORE
Line_4131	TO EAT ONLY DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4132	THEY ONLY EAT DEAD ORGANISMS AND YEAH
Line_4133	DECOMPOSERS
Line_4134	A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE
Line_4135	THE FOX IS A UHM THE FOX IS A OMNIVORE
Line_4136	THIS IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_4137	A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER YEAH
Line_4138	THEY BASICALLY CLEAN UP
Line_4139	DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4140	IT'S WATER AND IT GROWS
Line_4141	THE YEAST IS AN ORGANISM AND THE YEAST IS KIND OF A DECOMPOSER AND IT BREAKS DOWN THE COOKIE
Line_4142	THE YEAST NEEDS THE WATER TO BREAK DOWN THE COOKIE FOR
Line_4143	THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY'RE USED ON BREAD
Line_4144	WE WERE GROWING WHEAT
Line_4145	IT HAS SUNLIGHT THE OTHER DOESN'T HAVE SUNLIGHT
Line_4146	THE ROOTS OF THE PLANT AND WATERING THE PLANT
Line_4147	WATER SUNLIGHT AND SOIL
Line_4148	DOES NEED WATER BUT IT NEEDS IT ALSO NEEDS OXYGEN IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT AND IT NEEDS NUTRIENTS
Line_4149	THIS IS AIR PLANTS DO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_4150	SUNLIGHT AND NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4151	NUTRIENTS PLANTS DO NEED NUTRIENTS TO SURVIVE
Line_4152	PLANTS DON'T NEED FERTILIZER BUT IT HELPS THE PLANTS
Line_4153	HOUSE THAT'S ABOUT IT
Line_4154	UHM
Line_4155	UHM IT SHOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE OF THE MATERIALS WOULD GET RID OF
Line_4156	WHAT
Line_4157	THERE IS NO AIR SO IT WOULD DIE
Line_4158	KILLED IT ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4159	NO WATER IT'S NOT AS BAD AS NO AIR BUT STILL ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4160	THEY BOTH KILL THE PLANTS
Line_4161	HAS ALL THREE NUTRIENTS WHICH MAKES IT AWESOME AND YEAH
Line_4162	BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE NUTRIENTS
Line_4163	THEY'RE ARE THE START OF THE FOOD WEB IF THERE WASN'T PRODUCERS THEN THE FOOD WEB WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4164	UHM FOOD WEBS AND SYSTEMS AND CLEAVES
Line_4165	IT'S YEAST IT'S YEAST
Line_4166	THAT YEAST IS ALIVE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS A CELL OR CELLS IS ALIVE
Line_4167	IT'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS
Line_4168	I SEE CELLS OF A LEAF AND IT LOOKS COOL
Line_4169	I SEE MUSCLE CELLS
Line_4170	THAT THEY'RE MUSCLE AND THEY'RE CELLS
Line_4171	IT SHOWS ME THE BRAIN CELLS
Line_4172	I SEE REGULAR CELLS
Line_4173	SKIN CELLS CAN DRY AND DIE
Line_4174	SKIN BONE BLOOD ORGANS
Line_4175	HAVE MILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF CELLS AND YEAST ONLY HAS ONE
Line_4176	THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_4177	I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4178	IT'S THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM FOR HUMANS AND FOR BUTTERFLIES
Line_4179	BOTH HAVE SYSTEMS
Line_4180	IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_4181	I ALREADY TOLD YOU IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
Line_4182	THE INTESTINES UHM ABSORB THE WATER AND NUTRIENTS
Line_4183	SURE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS CELLS THOSE ARE THE MAIN POINTS
Line_4184	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_4185	IT IS A LEAF AND VEINS
Line_4186	IT'S A PARALLEL LEAF
Line_4187	IT'S A HAND LEAF SO STOP BUGGING ME JUST KIDDING ME IT'S A HAND PALMATE LEAF
Line_4188	NO IDEA MAYBE A CHAINSAW LEAF
Line_4189	THE EDGES LOOK LIKE A CHAINSAW AND THE VEINS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A FEATHER SO MAYBE IT'S A FEATHER CHAINSAW
Line_4190	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_4191	UHM I DON'T KNOW UHM IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_4192	UHM IT SHOWS WATER
Line_4193	I'M NOT VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4194	CIRCULATORY SYSTEM YEAH CIRCULATORY SYSTEM FOR THE
Line_4195	CIRCULATORY SYSTEM FOR THE WIN I TOLD YOU
Line_4196	HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS UHM AIR SYSTEM FOR THE WIND
Line_4197	UH O TWO COMES IN THE BODY AND C O TWO COMES OUT OF THE BODY
Line_4198	LUNGS
Line_4199	UHM THEY'RE IMPORTANT
Line_4200	IT UH GIVES OXYGEN TO THE BLOOD STREAM AND IT TAKES OFF C O TWO
Line_4201	IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BLOOD
Line_4202	E
Line_4203	FROM A AND B NO IT WAS E NOT F
Line_4204	THE UHM ESOPHAGUS
Line_4205	UHM I'M DOING OKAY UHM HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4206	SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN SCIENCE
Line_4207	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_4208	IT HAS A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE ARTERY AND IT COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE VEINS AND THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD
Line_4209	C O TWO OR CARBON DIOXIDE
Line_4210	IT'S BLOOD AND THE BLUE PART ARE THE CELLS AND THE BLUE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING ARE CARBON DIOXIDE
Line_4211	VEINS AND ARTERY
Line_4212	I UHM CAN UHM REPEAT THE
Line_4213	IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4214	I'M BLOOD COMING IN AND OUT AND IT BEING GROSS KIND OF
Line_4215	THEY HOLD BLOOD
Line_4216	THEY CARRY BLOOD THEY CARRY BLOOD
Line_4217	IT'S THE HEART IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4218	C CARRIES THE BLOOD TO THE CELLS
Line_4219	BLOOD TO THE CELL CARRY BLOOD TO THE CELLS
Line_4220	IT IS THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4221	IT'S BREATHING TO GET OXYGEN TO THE BLOOD TO CARRY THE CELLS
Line_4222	IT'S BREATHING
Line_4223	IT TAKES OXYGEN TO THE BLOOD TO
Line_4224	I DON'T UHM IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ORGAN IN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4225	THEY ARE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
Line_4226	UHM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4227	THE TRACHEA IT'S C STOP ASKING ME
Line_4228	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4229	THEY ALL LIVE ON EARTH THEY ALL ARE THINGS
Line_4230	IT IS TYPE IT'S TYPE OF A CHAIN
Line_4231	THERE ARE SUBSYSTEMS IN THE CAR
Line_4232	THERE IS THINGS THAT ARE LITTLE THAT ARE PARTS THAT GO IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT WOULD BE CALLED A SUBSYSTEM
Line_4233	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_4234	YOU CAN SEE PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4235	THE SHAPE OF THE HEART
Line_4236	THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE HUMAN BODY
Line_4237	UM THEY'RE INTERACTING PARTS AND
Line_4238	UH EARTH WHICH IS A SYSTEM
Line_4239	I THINK THE BIOSPHERE
Line_4240	I THINK THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OF WATER AND ANIMALS
Line_4241	BECAUSE THE BIOSPHERE IS IN THOSE PLACES
Line_4242	THE BOREAL FOREST AND THE WETLANDS
Line_4243	ALL OF THE FOOD WEBS HAVE A HUMAN BEING IN IT
Line_4244	THAT EVERYTHING COMES FROM THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
Line_4245	IT'S AN ORGANISM GETTING WHAT IT NEEDS
Line_4246	THEY'RE ADDING IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Line_4247	IT IS BACTERIA
Line_4248	NOTHING WELL DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_4249	WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIVING ORGANISMS AND LIVING THINGS AND ORGANISMS
Line_4250	ONE OF THEM HAS HAD MORE WATER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4251	REPEAT
Line_4252	THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND IT IS GROWING
Line_4253	WATER AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4254	PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE HUMANS FOOD FOR THEM THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT NEITHER CAN HUMANS
Line_4255	PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO LIVE AND TO GROW
Line_4256	IT IS SHOWING A PICTURE OF A PLANT AND A WATER DROP
Line_4257	AIR YOU CAN'T SEE BUT YOU CAN FEEL
Line_4258	YES I THINK THEY NEED IT MOST OF THE TIME
Line_4259	THE SUN IS SHINING DOWN ON THE PLANT
Line_4260	SUNLIGHT TO LIVE
Line_4261	YES
Line_4262	YES DEFINITELY
Line_4263	THIS IS A BURGER
Line_4264	YES YES
Line_4265	I THINK FOOD IS VERY IMPORTANT OR ELSE IS OR ELSE THE WORLD WOULDN'T WORK LIKE IT IS
Line_4266	IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE PEOPLE PLANTS NEED FOOD TO SURVIVE
Line_4267	I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IT SHOWS COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IT SHOWS
Line_4268	NO
Line_4269	WELL NO BECAUSE FERTILIZER CAN KILL THEM WHICH I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT
Line_4270	IT'S A HOUSE
Line_4271	NO PLANTS DO NOT NEED SHELTER TO SURVIVE
Line_4272	GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_4273	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT'S IN YOUR BODY
Line_4274	WE'VE BEEN TALKING THE HUMAN BODY AND
Line_4275	THEY BOTH HAVE SIMILAR BLOOD CELLS I MEAN CELLS NOT BLOOD CELLS CELLS
Line_4276	UHM IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4277	I SEE BLUE CELLS AND I SEE BLUE KIND OF SHORT SQUIGGLY LINES
Line_4278	THEY'RE ALL KIND OF TOGETHER THEY NEVER FLOW APART FROM EACH OTHER UH THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE A PAIR
Line_4279	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4280	UH I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
Line_4281	UH THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH THERE ARE VERY VERY MANY OF THEM UHM
Line_4282	THE ESOPHAGUS TRANSFERS THE BROKEN UP PIECES OF FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
Line_4283	THE ESOPHAGUS PLAYS A BIG A ROLE IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FOOD GETS DOWN TO THE UHM STOMACH
Line_4284	TO TAKE THE FOOD AND BREAK IT UP INTO PIECES AND MAKE SURE THAT IT TRANSFERS TO THE SMALL INTESTINE
Line_4285	OH THAT IT PUTS IT INTO ALL THE WASTE IT PUTS IT IN THE WASTE AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4286	WHEN THE COOKIE GETS WET IT TURNS INTO YEAST
Line_4287	MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE A TYPE OF PLANT
Line_4288	GRASS AND IT'S IT IT'S GRASS AND IT'S TYPE IT'S A TYPE OF PLANT
Line_4289	ON THE LEFT THE GRASS IS A LITTLE MORE DECAYED
Line_4290	BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF PLANT BUT ONE OF THEM IS MORE DECAYED THAN THE OTHER
Line_4291	ONE OF THEM HAS PROBABLY NOT GOTTEN AS MUCH WATER
Line_4292	THAT PLANTS ALSO HAVE BASIC SURVIVAL NEEDS LIKE WATER AND AND
Line_4293	SUNLIGHT AND WATER
Line_4294	YES THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE WHENEVER SOMETHING IS DEHYDRATED IT WILL DIE
Line_4295	I I THINK THEY DO NEED WATER BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING NEEDS WATER TO SURVIVE WITHOUT IT WE'D ALL DEHYDRATE AND DIE
Line_4296	ALL LIVING THINGS NEED AIR TO BREATHE
Line_4297	YES EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS AIR TO SURVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T BREATHE AND THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4298	I I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK PLANTS DO NEED AIR BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY'D ALL JUST THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE AND THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4299	PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE OTHERWISE THEY'D BE TOO COLD AND THEY'D AND THEN THEY'D THEY WOULD DIE
Line_4300	YES CAUSE THEN THEY'D GET TOO COLD AND DIE
Line_4301	I SEE A PICTURE OF A HAMBURGER AND A PLANT
Line_4302	YES IT WOULD DIE OF HUNGER AND AND THERE WOULD BE NO PLANT
Line_4303	WITHOUT A CERTAIN TYPE OF FOOD PLANTS WILL DIE
Line_4304	IT YES IF PLANTS DIDN'T GET FOOD THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4305	SOME KIND OF CAN AND A WITH A PICTURE OF AN APPLE ON IT
Line_4306	YES BECAUSE IT'S A TYPE OF SOIL AND PLANTS NEED TO BE PUT IN SOIL TO SURVIVE
Line_4307	NOT NEED IT BUT IT'S A HELP A HELPFUL THING FOR PLANTS
Line_4308	IT'S A HOUSE WHICH COULD BE A TYPE OF SHELTER FOR A PLANT
Line_4309	PLANTS NEED SHELTER WHEN IT'S LIKE COLD DURING LIKE THE WINTER AND OTHER TIME
Line_4310	I I THINK THEY DO NEED SHELTER TO TO SURVIVE CAUSE OTHERWISE DURING WINTER THEY'D JUST FREEZE UP AND DIE
Line_4311	IT SHOWS THAT PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT WATER AND WATER CAN EVAPORATE FROM IT
Line_4312	BECAUSE IT'S THEIR MAIN SOURCE NEEDS FOR SURVIVAL AND WITHOUT IT THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4313	THEY GROW AND THEY FEED ON LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4314	THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
Line_4315	IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUNLIGHT
Line_4316	IT DOESN'T IT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH IT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH SUNLIGHT
Line_4317	IT WON'T GET ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4318	IT LOOKS MORE MUCH MORE DECAYED AND YEAH AND ORANGE AND SICKLY BECAUSE IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND WATER BUT NO AIR
Line_4319	IT GETS ENOUGH WATER AND SUNLIGHT BUT NO AIR
Line_4320	IT MAKES IT DECAY EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES WITHOUT SUNLIGHT
Line_4321	IT LOOKS SICKLY TOO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER
Line_4322	IT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER BUT IT'S BEEN GETTING AIR AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4323	WITHOUT WATER IT'LL IT WILL DIE
Line_4324	IT IT DOES NOT LOOK SICKLY IT LOOKS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER SUNLIGHT AND AIR
Line_4325	CAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF SUNLIGHT WATER OR AIR
Line_4326	THIS ONE HAS ENOUGH WATER AIR AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4327	THE PLANT IS STAYING HEALTHY
Line_4328	THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FEED ON EACH OTHER AND THERE ARE DECOMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMER
Line_4329	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4330	THEY'RE A PART OF A FOOD WEB
Line_4331	WITHOUT PRODUCERS THE FOOD WEBS WOULD JUST START FALLING APART
Line_4332	THEY START WITH DECOMPOSERS THEN PRODUCERS THEN THEY END WITH CONSUMERS
Line_4333	PLANTS NEED FOOD WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SHELTER OR FERTILIZER
Line_4334	UHM THE HUMAN AND THE YEAST ARE BOTH MADE OF CELLS THEY ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS BUT THEY ARE STILL CELLS
Line_4335	UHM PLANTS ARE NOT SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE CELL
Line_4336	UH UHM HUMANS ALSO HAVE SEVERAL CELL UH A LOT OF CELLS
Line_4337	THERE ARE BRAIN CELLS AND WHICH ARE DIFFERENT
Line_4338	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT SO THAT THAT THESE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_4339	I SEE SKIN CELLS WHICH ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM BRAIN CELLS AND UHM MUSCLE CELLS
Line_4340	THAT UHM SKIN CELLS ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BODY
Line_4341	I DON'T THINK SO NO
Line_4342	WHAT WHAT
Line_4343	NOTHING
Line_4344	NOTHING
Line_4345	I DON'T THINK SO STUPID
Line_4346	YO
Line_4347	I DON'T KNOW THERE'S TEN THAT'S A GUESS
Line_4348	WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT DO DO DO
Line_4349	WELL WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS
Line_4350	THEY ALL INTERACT WITH PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SO THEY WORK SO THAT THE WHOLE THING WORKS BLAH
Line_4351	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4352	INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE US MOVE
Line_4353	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4354	THE INTERACTING SUBSYSTEMS THAT MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4355	HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE HUMAN BODY WORK
Line_4356	IT HAS LOTS OF SUBSYSTEMS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE EARTH WORK CORRECTLY
Line_4357	THEY INTERACT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE EARTH LIKE IT IS
Line_4358	I SEE THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM BLAH
Line_4359	THERE IS THE ECOSYSTEM
Line_4360	THE BIOSPHERE IS LIVING THINGS
Line_4361	BIOSPHERE IS ALL THE WATER IN THE WORLD
Line_4362	ECOSYSTEMS LIVE IN BIOSPHERE BECAUSE BIOSPHERE'S WATER AND WE NEED TO LIVE WITH
Line_4363	HUMAN BODY FISH DINOSAUR WHATEVER
Line_4364	THIS IS THE ONE OF THE ECOSYSTEMS FOR FORESTS THIS ALSO SHOWS A FOOD CHAIN
Line_4365	HOW PREDATORS EAT OTHER SMALLER THINGS
Line_4366	SOMETHING EATS SOMETHING THE THING THAT GETS EATEN ENERGY TRANSFERS TO THE THING THAT ATE IT
Line_4367	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIFE CYCLES PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS ARE ALL PART OF THE LIFE CYCLES
Line_4368	IT MAKES HIS OWN FOOD BY
Line_4369	THEY DO NOT EAT OTHER
Line_4370	THE BACTERIA FUNGI PINE TREE AND GRASS
Line_4371	YOU EAT OTHER LIVING ORGANISM
Line_4372	THEY EAT OTHER LIVING
Line_4373	THE RABBIT SALAMANDER BEETLE SPARROW RED TAILED HAWK AND SNAKE
Line_4374	IT EATS DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4375	THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
Line_4376	IT'S ABOUT WHAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS EAT
Line_4377	THE DEER AND RABBIT ARE HERBIVORES
Line_4378	YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT
Line_4379	THEY EAT MEAT OR DECAYING MEATS AND BERRIES OR BERRY
Line_4380	A CARNIVORE OR AN HERBIVORE
Line_4381	A HERBIVORE
Line_4382	THEY BREAK DOWN BAD DECAYING MATTER AND MAKE IT SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE EARTH AND SOIL
Line_4383	LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_4384	IT HAS TO DO WITH THE YEAST IF YEAST WILL GROW
Line_4385	IT'S WATCHING YEAST GROW OUT OF ITS DORMANT STAGE
Line_4386	I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO GET YEAST OUT OF ITS DORMANT STAGE
Line_4387	I THINK THE CELLS ARE THE YEAST
Line_4388	HAVE BEEN DOING AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHICH TO SEE IF WHEAT WILL GROW IN DARK BAGS AND WHEAT WILL GROW IN LIGHT BAGS
Line_4389	THE UNHEALTHY LOOKING ONE WAS GROWN IN THE DARK BAG
Line_4390	SHOWING US HOW FOOD HOW THE PLANTS FOOD IS PRODUCED
Line_4391	CARBON DIOXIDE SUNLIGHT WATER
Line_4392	NEEDS NUTRIENTS TO SURVIVE
Line_4393	IT SHOWS A CAN WITH A TOMATO ON IT
Line_4394	THERE IS A HOUSE AND PLANTS HOW NICE
Line_4395	IT SHOWS HOW PHOTOSYNTHESIS WORKS AND WHAT PHOTOSYNTHESIS NEEDS TO WORK
Line_4396	SO THEY CAN GET FOOD FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Line_4397	IT CRIPPLED IT AND IT'S DYING
Line_4398	THE PLANT NEEDS ALL THREE THINGS TO SURVIVE AND MAKE ITS OWN ENERGY
Line_4399	IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE SO IT IS GROWING QUITE NICELY
Line_4400	IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE
Line_4401	EVENTUALLY THE ENERGY FROM THE PLANTS COMES UP TO HAWKS EAGLES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_4402	HELLO HELLO AND GOODBYE
Line_4403	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS
Line_4404	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4405	IT HAS DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4406	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER TO MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS WORK HOW DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4407	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT HELP IT WORK AND IF ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS WEREN'T THERE IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4408	ALL OF THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4409	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY PARTS THAT MAKES THE BODY WORK
Line_4410	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4411	IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND SUBSYSTEMS LIKE ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND PLANTS
Line_4412	TALKING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND UM AND ALSO
Line_4413	ABOUT SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEM
Line_4414	BECAUSE THEY HAVE MANY INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4415	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKES IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND THE INTERACTING PARTS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S MAKING IT WORK
Line_4416	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO THE WHOLE BODY'S A LOOP
Line_4417	WELL WITHOUT ANY OF THESE THE SYSTEM THE WHOLE SYSTEM WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4418	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS IT WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE SYSTEM
Line_4419	UM
Line_4420	BIOSPHERE IS ABOUT PLANTS HUMANS FISHES AND WATER
Line_4421	THEY SHOW WHAT ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER AND WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS IN THE ECOSYSTEM
Line_4422	IT'S DOING GOOD I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4423	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE SURFACE
Line_4424	WE PUT WAX PAPER ON THE BLUE SURFACE
Line_4425	WATER SLIDES DOWN A SLOPE
Line_4426	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER TO ONE DROP AND LESS WATER TO ANOTHER DROP AND THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS
Line_4427	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE SLOPE
Line_4428	WE DID NOT USE THE ROCK OR THE PAPER CLIP BUT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BOTH SUNK
Line_4429	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_4430	KIND OF BLENDED WITH THE OTHER WATER BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOT STIRRED OR MIXED BY ACCIDENT
Line_4431	COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT EITHER STAYS IN THE VIAL OR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_4432	WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING WITH ICE AND WATER
Line_4433	THEY WOULD BE LIQUIDS
Line_4434	WHEN WATER COOLS IT GETS DENSER
Line_4435	UM DENSITY IS MAKING THE WATER LEVEL DROP BELOW ROOM TEMPERATURE
Line_4436	ICE IS ACTUALLY LESS DENSE THAN WATER BECAUSE IT FLOATS
Line_4437	THAT TELLS ME THAT WHEN THAT THE COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN REGULAR WATER
Line_4438	COOL WATER CREATES LESS DENSITY SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES
Line_4439	WHEN YOU PUT WATER IN THE FREEZER IT TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND IT BECOMES A SOLID
Line_4440	IT GETS LESS DENSE CAUSING THE WATER TO RISE
Line_4441	WATER TAKES UP MORE SPACE AS IT IS HEATED
Line_4442	IT MEANS TO SOLIDIFY I THINK
Line_4443	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EVAPORATING OVER TIME
Line_4444	IT TURNS OUT MY MICROPHONE WAS NOT IN THE PROPER POSITION SO THAT'S WHY YOU COULDN'T HEAR ME BUT I COULD HEAR YOU
Line_4445	THE UNCOVERED WET PAPER TOWEL
Line_4446	HEAVIER BECAUSE IT
Line_4447	THE WET PAPER TOWEL STAYED WET BECAUSE THE PLASTIC LID IS SEALING IN THE HUMIDITY
Line_4448	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4449	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EXPOSED TO HEAT WHICH CAUSED EVAPORATION
Line_4450	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS TOUCHING THE AIR CAUSING IT TO BE ABLE TO EVAPORATE
Line_4451	THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EVAPORATING
Line_4452	I WANT TO SAY CREATING LITTLE DROPLETS
Line_4453	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS REALLY COLD
Line_4454	I THINK THE DROP ER THE WATER ON THE LID ARE WATER DROPLETS SO THAT BASICALLY IS
Line_4455	ON THE ER IN THE CONDENSATION CHAMBER NOT OUTSIDE THE CONDENSATION CHAMBER
Line_4456	WE OBSERVED THAT THE CONDENSATION WAS IN THE INSIDE WITH OUR ACTUAL CONDENSATION CHAMBERS
Line_4457	THE WATER HAS TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE CUP BUT WITH THE LID IT DEFIES EVAPORATION
Line_4458	IT IS REALLY COOL CAUSE IT JUST AMAZES ME
Line_4459	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOIL AND GRAVEL
Line_4460	I SEE A PILE OF SOIL AND A PILE OF GRAVEL
Line_4461	I KNOW THAT WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH SOIL AND WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH GRAVEL
Line_4462	WELL SOME MATERIALS OBSERVE ER ABSORB WATER BUT SOME ALSO JUST LET WATER PASS THROUGH THEM SO WELL THERE'S ACTUALLY IT'S THERE'S USUALLY SOME ABSORBING BUT YEAH THERE'S STILL
Line_4463	WATER CAN SPIN A WATER WHEEL TO MAKE A
Line_4464	PAPER ER THE CLIPS AND THE REST ARE CLEAR BUT WE PUT WELL WHAT MY GROUP DID IS WE PUT TWO PAPER CLIP TWO CLIPS ON EACH END OF THE BOX PUT THE LONG STRAW IN THE HOLES OF THE PAPER CLIP AND WE PUT ONE OF THE RED BLOCKS IN THE CENTER AND WE PUT FOUR OTHER ON THE DIFFERENT ON OR AROUND IT AND WE HAD A STRING WHICH ISN'T HERE AND WE TIED IT TO THIS CLIP AND WE TIED THE STRAW AROUND THE CLIP CAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO FOR THE
Line_4465	IT IS A WATER MILL WHICH HELPS POWER THE HOUSE AND YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THIS QUESTION
Line_4466	EXCEPT FOR IN SMALLER AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE DID EXCEPT FOR THERE WAS A STRING THAT WAS PULLED UP
Line_4467	UM FORCE ANOTHER BLADE IS RIGHT THERE SO THAT KEEPS IT SPINNING AS LONG AS THERE IS A FLOW OF WATER
Line_4468	BYE MARNIE I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU
Line_4469	I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4470	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND UM ITS PROPERTIES
Line_4471	THE WATER IS MAKING BEADS ON THE ALUMINUM FOIL
Line_4472	THE PAPER TOWEL HAS ABSORBED THE WATER
Line_4473	THE PAPER TOWEL HAS ABSORBED THE WATER LEAVING A TINY MARK
Line_4474	THE SMALLER DROPLETS CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A BIGGER DROPLET
Line_4475	WATER ON DIFFERENT SURFACES CAN
Line_4476	THE WATER OR THE PAPER TOWEL HAS ABSORBED THE WATER
Line_4477	THE SOAPY WATER DECREASES THE SURFACE TENSION WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE SURFACE TENSION
Line_4478	THE SOAP ER SOAPY WATER IS AFFECTING THE SURFACE TENSION AND
Line_4479	YES DROPLETS OF WATER ARE COMING OUT
Line_4480	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH WATER
Line_4481	SURFACE TENSION IS HAPPENING
Line_4482	SURFACE TENSION IS THE PROPERTY THAT KEEPS WATER TOGETHER AND NOT IN A THIN LINE
Line_4483	S SALT WATER HAS NO AFFECT AND IT ACTS LIKE PLAIN WATER
Line_4484	THE DOME NOT TO BUILD AS HIGH
Line_4485	MARNIE I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4486	UM THE BOB STARTED AT THE SIDE OF THE DESK AND WE DROPPED IT AND IT WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4487	BECAUSE OF EVERY ONE
Line_4488	I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE TODAY
Line_4489	THE BOB AND UM
Line_4490	HOW MANY NUMBERS OF S OF SWINGS THERE ARE
Line_4491	AND UM PUT EITHER ONE OF 'EM ON THE STICK AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4492	YOU PUT 'EM IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER STICKS THAT ARE GLUED ON TO THE FLIPPER BASE UH THE F THE FLIPPER STICK
Line_4493	UM WELL IT'S GONNA TELL YOU LIKE HOW MANY CENTIMETERS OUT IT'S GONNA BE SO IF YOU WANT IT LIKE TH FOUR CENTIMETERS OUT YOU'D GO TO THE FOUR CENTIMETER LINE OR IF YOU WANTED TWO CENTIMETERS OUT YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE TWO CENTIMETER LINE AND IT'LL HELP THE CORK E EITHER GO SHORTER DISTANCE OR LONGER DISTANCE
Line_4494	WELL I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A BALL SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4495	I UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DIDN'T MAKE REALLY MUCH SENSE
Line_4496	UM THE LENGTH OF STRING SO
Line_4497	THE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IT
Line_4498	LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT'S GONNA DO IN TEN SECONDS AND YEAH
Line_4499	THE PENDULUM LENGTH
Line_4500	UM IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM IS DOING
Line_4501	MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN
Line_4502	UM THE S IN SOME CUPS THAT WERE BIGGER LIKE UM IT WOULD HOLD MORE PASSENGERS BECAUSE IT WAS LITTLE BIT TALLER UM SO IT'D HOLD MORE PASSENGERS BEFORE IT WOULD SINK AS IT FOR LIKE THE ONES THAT WERE KIND OF SMALLER IT'LL HOLD LESS PASSENGERS BECAUSE IT WAS A SMALLER CUP AND IT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IT DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH HEIGHT THAT SO WHEN UM HOLD LIKE IT WOULDN'T UM
Line_4503	IT'S TELLING YOU THAT THE NUMBER OF CAPACITY UM THE NUMBER OF CAPACITY UM
Line_4504	UM AS THE CAPACITY GOES UP YOU HOLD UH IT HOLDS MO LIKE M MORE PASSENGERS
Line_4505	YOU CAN LEARN THAT UM
Line_4506	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_4507	YOU WOULD PROBABLY COUNT LIKE BY TENS OR FIVES MAY BE
Line_4508	THE OH THE X AXIS TELLS US HOW MANY RUBBER BANDS LIKE THERE ARE
Line_4509	THE MORE RUBBER BANDS THERE ARE THE FURTHER IT'S GOING TO IT'S GONNA GO
Line_4510	IT'S GOING UP
Line_4511	THAT IT'S GOING DOWN INSTEAD OF GOING UP
Line_4512	UM THEY'RE ABOUT UM LIKE HOW THINGS LIKE HOW THEY MOVE LIKE HOW THEY KEEP ON SPINNING
Line_4513	UM IT'S A PENDULUM IT THE PENNY IS WHAT KEEPS IT SPINNING
Line_4514	IT KEEPS ON SPINNING AT THE SAME LEVEL
Line_4515	UM ONE WILL SWING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN S SLOW DOWN TWO WILL GO LONGER AND THEN SO AND SO
Line_4516	UM THE THIRTY EIGHT ONE IT WILL SWING FOR
Line_4517	IT WILL SWING EIGHT SWINGS FOR IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4518	SO THE SHORTER ONE UM SWUNG LONGER THAN THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER
Line_4519	UM THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY SWING THE LEAST AMOUNT
Line_4520	UM TODAY WE STARTED MAKING CATAPULTS
Line_4521	UM IT'S G IT'S GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING
Line_4522	UM THE THE PAPERCLIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU C COULDN'T FLIP ANYTHING WITH IT
Line_4523	UM ON ON THIS THERE'S UM UH C JUST A PLANE CORK LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE RUBBER CORK
Line_4524	YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE FLIP STICK ABOUT UM
Line_4525	UM THIS IS SHOWING UM THE HOW HIGH IT'S GOING LIKE AT H THE HIGHEST POINT AND IT'S GOING ABOUT
Line_4526	UM WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING PEN PENDULUMS AND WE STARTED DOING P UM GRAPHS ABOUT THEM TODAY
Line_4527	UM IF YOU IT WOULDN'T BE A CONTROLLED VARIABLE
Line_4528	UM THIS ONE IS ABOUT UM HOW LONG THE STRING IS AND HOW MANY UM SWINGS IT DID
Line_4529	UM THE SHORTEST OF LENGTH THE STRING IS SWINGING THE MOST AND THEN THE LONGER STRING IS SWINGING THE LEAST
Line_4530	COULD YOU YOU USE UM A GRAPH AND YEAH
Line_4531	UM IN THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4532	UM WE STARTED TODAY LEARNING ABOUT LIFE ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4533	WELL WE FIRST PUT THE BOAT IN WITH NO NO PENNIES IN IT
Line_4534	UM MAYBE MAKING THE BOAT HIGHER OR LONGER TO FIT MORE PEOPLE IN
Line_4535	THE BOAT WOULD HIT THE BOTTOM AND LIKE JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP WITHOUT GETTING WATER IN IT
Line_4536	UM YOU COULD IT'S A CONTROLLING A GOOD VARIABLE IS WHEN YOU UM ONLY SWITCH ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4537	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4538	UM THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4539	UM IT IT'S TELLING YOU THE NUMBER OF THE CUP AND HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_4540	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANES AND F UM FLYING THEM ON FISHING WIRE
Line_4541	UM YOU WANT TO
Line_4542	THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4543	UH NUMBER OF WINDS
Line_4544	UM SO THE THE ONES WITHOUT THE PAPER CLIPS GOES THE FARTHEST AND THE ONES WITH THE MOST PAPER CLIPS GOES THE LEAST
Line_4545	UM THAT IF YOU DID CHANGE THEM IT WOULD AFFECT UH HOW IF FLIES
Line_4546	UM I WANT TO FIGURE OUT IF IF YOU HAD MORE ON UM HOW WOULD IT AFFECT HOW IF FLIES
Line_4547	CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED ALL OF THE ALL THE MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4548	HOW FAR THE DISTANCE I MEAN JUST THE DISTANCE
Line_4549	UH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
Line_4550	UM WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE DISTANCE GOES UP WHEN WE ADD PASSENGERS OR IF IT GOES DOWN WHEN WE ADD PASSENGERS
Line_4551	UM WELL YOU HAVE TO YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME OR ELSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4552	UM YOU'D GET MORE ACCURATE UM ANSWERS AND THINGS
Line_4553	UM THE MOTOR WHICH IS THE RUBBERBANDS AND THE DISTANCE
Line_4554	UM ON THE Y AXIS UM IT SHOWS THE THE DISTANCE THE PLANE FLEW
Line_4555	I DON'T KNOW WHAT A DEPENDENT OR A INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS
Line_4556	UM I NOTICED THAT UM INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BEFORE AND THAT DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS IS WHAT WE LEARNED
Line_4557	WE'LL FIND THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4558	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAST PART YOU SAID
Line_4559	UM THIS POINT IS UM KEPT STAYING THE SAME SO THAT MAKE IT A STRAIGHT LINE
Line_4560	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING UM THE FLIPPER BASE AND UM WE DID THE GRAPH TODAY
Line_4561	UM THIS SPACE IS TO GET IN SO THAT YOU COULD BOUNCE THE CORK
Line_4562	UM IT UM GROWS THE ONE C M AND THE TWO C M AND THREE C M
Line_4563	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S UM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND NOT THE OPPOSITE WAY LIKE FROM
Line_4564	UM I NOTICE THERE'S RUBBER CORK A CORK AN WOODEN BALL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THEM ARE
Line_4565	I SEE THAT THE PLASTIC BALL IS BOUNCING ON THE WALL AND IT BOUNCED BACK
Line_4566	M I THINK YOU ALREADY SHOWED ME THIS PICTURE
Line_4567	IT HAS THE HEIGHT THE HEIGHT SO THAT CAN HELP IT BY GO F UM GO FARTHER
Line_4568	UM LENGTHS AND NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4569	UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE UM THE LENGTH AND THE STRING
Line_4570	IT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF SWINGS UM EITHER LONG LARGER OR SMALLER
Line_4571	M WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING THE SWINGS THAT UM YOU PULL ONE STRING DOWN AND MAKE SOMETHING SWINGS
Line_4572	IS X GRAPH AND Y BAR
Line_4573	THE NUMBER OF STRINGS WHICH IS FROM TEN TO TWO HUNDRED
Line_4574	ABOUT THE HEIGHT AND WHICH IS UM THE CAPACITY
Line_4575	I DON'T GET IT I CAN'T CLICK THE PENNIES
Line_4576	UM I TRIED TO CLICK BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_4577	I KNOW THAT UM N D IS WILL BE BIGGER AND
Line_4578	AND A WILL BE SMALLER BOAT THAT UM THOUGH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME HEIGHT AS THREE CENTIMETERS
Line_4579	YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME TO SEE IT'S DIFFERENT NOT CHANGE LIKE THREE OR FOUR VARIABLES AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT
Line_4580	I THINK YOU ALREADY SHOWED ME THIS UM PICTURE
Line_4581	UM OF COURSE IF THE WATER'S MOVING M I THINK THE PENNY WOULD TIP OR THE WATER WILL GOES IN
Line_4582	TODAY ME AND MY PARTNER JUST MADE THE PLANE SO
Line_4583	NO WE DIDN'T GET TO PUT THE FISHING LINE TO OUR PLANE
Line_4584	YOU JUST ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4585	UM ONE OF THE STRING IS STRAIGHTER AND ONE OF THE STRING IS LOOSER
Line_4586	I THINK THIS ONLY HAS ONE VARIABLE CHANGED
Line_4587	UM WELL I THINK YOU CAN UM SLEEP MORE ON THURSDAYS AND DON'T GET SLEEPY ON FRIDAYS
Line_4588	YOU JUST ASKED ME THAT UM LIKE A MINUTE AGO
Line_4589	WE CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS UM WE DO TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT TEN
Line_4590	YOU CHANGE THE PAPER CLIPS IN THIS EXAMPLE
Line_4591	SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4592	IT'S ABOUT A IT'S A GRAPH AND THERE'S A Y AND X AXIS
Line_4593	THAT'S TO SEE HOW YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE Y OR X AXIS IS THEN
Line_4594	YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4595	YEAH UM THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IS THE VARIABLE ON THIS TABLE OF DATA
Line_4596	YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT
Line_4597	THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP TOO
Line_4598	SAME WITH YOU BYE
Line_4599	WE GOT DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRINGS AND SEE HOW MANY SWINGS IT WOULD MAKE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4600	WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG PIECE OF STRING YOU'LL HAVE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4601	THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF PENDULUMS
Line_4602	IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID FIVE SWINGS
Line_4603	A PENNY AND A PAPERCLIP AND A STRING
Line_4604	THE BOB MAKES THE STRING SWING
Line_4605	THE LONGER THE STRING LENGTH THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM WILL MAKE
Line_4606	WE JUST FINISHED THE PENDULUM EXPERIMENT
Line_4607	IT'S ABOUT THE PENDULUM LENGTHS AND THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM MAKES
Line_4608	YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF SOMETHING
Line_4609	WHEN YOU USE A GRAPH IT TELLS YOU DATA
Line_4610	WHEN YOU USE A GRAPH TO HELP YOU PREDICT YOU CAN GET A BETTER CONCLUSION
Line_4611	WITH A TWENTY METER STRING YOU WILL GET FIFTEEN SWINGS
Line_4612	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS
Line_4613	R PAPER BOATS AND WE ARE SEEING HOW MUCH CAPACITY AND PASSENGERS A BOAT CAN HOLD
Line_4614	THEY AREN'T LIFEBOATS BUT WE MADE THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4615	THERE WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT IT WE JUST TESTED TO SEE HOW IT WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT DIDN'T
Line_4616	IF YOU PUT TOO MANY PON PENNIES IN ONE BOAT IT
Line_4617	LIKE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER BUT IF YOU IT MIGHT SINK FASTER BUT IF YOU UM SPREAD IT AROUND IT'LL PROBABLY HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4618	OKAY THANK YOU BYE
Line_4619	WE FINISHED MAKING OUR BOATS AND THEN WE GRAPHED ALL OUR BOATS PLUS TWO OTHERS
Line_4620	IT TOLD ME WHAT THE
Line_4621	YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION LAST TIME LIKE THE LAST THING YOU SAID
Line_4622	THE PLANE IS MOVING ACROSS THE STRING
Line_4623	WOULD SEE THAT THAT YOUR PLANE WON'T FLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
Line_4624	WE ONLY FLEW IT ONE DISTANCE THAT IS TWO YARDS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANY OTHER DISTANCES
Line_4625	ONE PLANE IS GOING ON A STRAIGHT STRING AND THE OTHER PLANE IS LIKE DOING KIND OF LIKE A DIAGONAL
Line_4626	I LIKE VISITING WITH YOU TOO
Line_4627	PLANES AND GRAPHING
Line_4628	WE COULD USE LIKE UM WE UM WE COULD SEE UM TO UM WHAT WHAT WAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND LIKE WE WOULD GO AND LIKE WE WOULD SEE FROM FOUR WOULD WORK AND OR FIVE OR IF WE NEED I WENT BY FOURS IN MY GRAPH UM I WENT TO SIXTY BECAUSE MY HIGHEST NUMBER WAS FIFTY EIGHT SO WE HAD TO GO UM A LITTLE BIT HIGH BE UH BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T IF WE WENT BY FIVES AND YOU GET TO CROSS THIS NUMBER IN THE YOU WOULD LIKE W YOU WOULD LIKE TO
Line_4629	UM WELL INDEPENDENT VARIABLE WOULD BE LIKE YOU HAVE TO SWITCH ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
Line_4630	THANK YOU
Line_4631	ARE WE OUT OF TIME OR NOT
Line_4632	I PUT ON THE TABLE AND SWUNG IT THREE TIMES
Line_4633	IT'S A PENDULUM
Line_4634	HELP YOU WITH MATHS
Line_4635	SWING LET GO AND SWING
Line_4636	HMM NOT SURE
Line_4637	LONGER STRING WILL GO LONGER I THINK
Line_4638	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4639	IN SCIENCE I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY SO I DIDN'T CHANGE ANY
Line_4640	IT WAS ABOUT TESTING TO SEE HOW FAR IT WENT
Line_4641	THE ANGLE AND THE DISTANCE THE CORK FLEW
Line_4642	UM THAT THE BALL ON THE TOP IS BIGGER AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS S S
Line_4643	IT SAYS THAT THEY BOTH WENT ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4644	THE ANGLE
Line_4645	OBJECT AND MASS LENGTH DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE
Line_4646	UM OKAY
Line_4647	BECAUSE MAYBE OTHER THINGS WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE GRAPH
Line_4648	E DOING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4649	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4650	WE WERE DOING THE PLANES AND MAKING GRAPHS AND TESTING THEM
Line_4651	STRING WITH PAPERCLIP AND THEN PUT PENNY
Line_4652	S STRING PAPERCLIP AND PENNY
Line_4653	I NOTICED THAT THE SMALL ONE DID THE MOST
Line_4654	THE BIG ONE DID THE LESS I MEAN DID THE MEDIUM
Line_4655	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4656	STRING PAPERCLIP PENNY
Line_4657	LONGER OR SHORTER STRING
Line_4658	LONG OR SHORT STRING
Line_4659	S SMALLER OR DIFFERENT PAPERCLIP
Line_4660	SMALLER PENNY SMALLER KIND OF COIN OR PAPERCLIP OR MORE PAPERCLIP
Line_4661	A PENDULUM WITH STRING PAPERCLIP AND PENNY IN FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4662	LIFE WA BOATS
Line_4663	TH THEY'RE MADE OF CUPS
Line_4664	THEY'RE MADE OF BOAT THEY'RE MADE OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4665	UH I MEAN
Line_4666	WE MADE LINES ON THE CUP AND WE CUT WHERE THAT WAS TO MAKE BOATS
Line_4667	SMALL MEDIUM AND BIG
Line_4668	FERRY BOATS
Line_4669	PUTTING DIMES OR PENNIES FOR PASSENGERS IN THE BOAT
Line_4670	FOR MY BOATS SMALL WAS S SEVEN MEDIUM WAS EIGHT AND BIG WAS TWENTY FIVE TO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4671	I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_4672	PASSENGERS IN BOATS
Line_4673	THE ONE WITH THE TWENTY HAS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE TWELVE
Line_4674	BOATS WITH PASSENGERS AS PENNIES
Line_4675	MAKE IT IN ACTUAL BOATS
Line_4676	MAKE IT BIGGER CAPACITY
Line_4677	GOOD
Line_4678	MEASURING THE MASS AND THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4679	FIFTY MILLILITERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SMALLER SYRINGE
Line_4680	A GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_4681	IT GOES UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE SYRINGE ONLY GOES UP TO FIFTY
Line_4682	SO LIKE IF YOU LIKE POURED WATER IN YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER YOU HAVE
Line_4683	YOU MEASURED THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4684	THE MA THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4685	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4686	WELL FIFTY MILLILITERS IS
Line_4687	WHAT IS CAPACITY
Line_4688	IT HO CA UM THE CAPACITY OF IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4689	WE DIDN'T DO A MEASUREMENT OF THE WATER WITH THREE CUPS
Line_4690	HOW HOT OR COLD THE WATER IS
Line_4691	OR YEAH OR WHAT THE HEAT OF SOMETHING IS
Line_4692	UM KNOWING WO THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_4693	WELL YOUR FINGER CAN'T TELL THE EXACT TEMPERATURE BUT A THERMOMETER CAN
Line_4694	WHAT STANDARD TOOL
Line_4695	C CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT
Line_4696	WELL YOU COULD USE FAHRENHEIT YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO USE CELSIUS UNLESS YOU LIKE NEED TO
Line_4697	GETS COLDER
Line_4698	WELL IT'S FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS AND IT'S WARMER THAN TEN DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_4699	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT CAN'T BE HIGHER THAN FIFTY
Line_4700	WELL
Line_4701	UH ABOUT WHAT
Line_4702	WELL EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_4703	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVE MEANS
Line_4704	UH I I WANT SOME
Line_4705	WE USED A CHART
Line_4706	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_4707	NG HOTTER IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE GETTING COLDER AND IT MIGHT BE GETTING HOTTER
Line_4708	IT DROPPED RAPIDLY
Line_4709	IT UM IF IT GETS COLDER IT WILL DROP IF IT GETS WARMER IT'LL GO HIGHER BECAUSE WARM AIR RISES AND COLD AIR GOES DOWN
Line_4710	BILLY BOB JO BILLY BILLY HI HI
Line_4711	YEAH IT DOES
Line_4712	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4713	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING THINGS
Line_4714	UM IN CLASS WE USED STRAWS WHICH WAS KIND OF HARD
Line_4715	I THINK MY FRIEND NICK IS MAYBE A METER I THINK
Line_4716	TO THE IT IT IT'S LIKE THE DOORKNOB FROM A DOOR YEAH NICK IS REALLY SHORT
Line_4717	YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU USE YOUR UM YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4718	KIND OF LIKE GUESSING
Line_4719	YOU SPREAD YOUR HAND APART WITH YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB
Line_4720	I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4721	TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE AND LIKE EXACT
Line_4722	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4723	I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_4724	UM MOST LIKELY A METER STICK
Line_4725	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4726	TO MAKE SURE LIKE YOU PUT IT YOU HAVE IT STRAIGHT NOT ALL LIKE FAT AND FOLDED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4727	WE MEASURED OUR ARMS OUR WRIST TO OUR ELBOW OUR FOOT AND OUR HEIGHT
Line_4728	WE DIDN'T MEASURE OUR NOSES
Line_4729	MAYBE A FOOT
Line_4730	YOU'RE USING YOUR PINKIE FOR EACH CENTIMETER
Line_4731	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4732	NONE OF THEM WERE THE SAME FOR ME AT LEAST MAYBE FOR OTHER PEOPLE SOME WERE THE SAME
Line_4733	THAT HIS ARMS AND HIS HEIGHT ARE THE EXACT SAME
Line_4734	SOME ARE BIGGER THAN OTHER BODY PARTS AND SOME ARE SMALLER
Line_4735	UH TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4736	YOU CAN USE YOUR THUMB AND YOUR PINKIE TO MEASURE TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4737	AND
Line_4738	HELLO UM MINE JUST LIKE STOPPED RIGHT THERE
Line_4739	THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE IT DEPENDS OF ON HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT MATERIALS SO
Line_4741	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4742	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4743	ONE'S HEAVIER CAUSE IF IT'S HEAVIER IT LEANS IF IT'S LIGHTER IT DOESN'T LEAN IT STAYS UP
Line_4744	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4745	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4746	THAT ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER AND ONE OF THEM IS SMALLER
Line_4747	UM THERE'S TWENTY FIVE GRAM THERE IS TEN GRAM THERE'S TWENTY GRAM THERE'S ONE GRAM
Line_4748	GOODBYE I HAVE TO GO SHUT UP
Line_4749	I I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4750	UM WHAT
Line_4751	IT'S ABOUT LIKE TWENTY GRAMS AND YEAH IT'S JUST ABOUT GRAMS
Line_4752	ARE IN ONE CUP AND THE GRAMS ARE IN THE OTHER CUP AND THERE'S THREE GRAMS FOR FOR IT TO MAKE FOR IT TO BE THE SAME MASS WEIGHT
Line_4753	TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS THE OBJECT OBJECT THAT YOU'RE WEIGHING IS
Line_4754	I'M NOT E I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4755	WAIT WAIT A SECOND
Line_4756	UM YOU WOULD
Line_4757	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAMS FOR FOR IT TO BE THE SAME MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_4758	I THINK IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED
Line_4759	YOU WEIGH MASS AND STUFF
Line_4760	THAT UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_4761	HMMM
Line_4762	UM I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4763	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4764	IT'S SPONGES DRY WET AND SOAKED
Line_4765	A SOAKED SPONGE IS REALLY HEAVY
Line_4766	IT'S JUST A DRY SPONGE JUST A DRY SPONGE IN A CUP HEAVIER THAN NOTHING
Line_4767	IF YOU DON'T KNOW OR IF YOU DO KNOW
Line_4768	THAN A
Line_4769	IT CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER AND IT'S
Line_4770	UM IT WAS IT WAS
Line_4771	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER AS USUAL
Line_4772	I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4773	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_4774	THAT THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE OF THEM
Line_4775	BECCA SKIPPED YESTERDAY
Line_4776	CUPS YEAH
Line_4777	THERE ARE
Line_4778	THE WATER IN THE CUP WELL THE VOLUME THE VOLUME IN THE CUP
Line_4779	POURING IT INTO A DIFFERENT CUP LIKE DROPS LITTLE DROPS
Line_4780	YEAH THEY'RE ABOUT
Line_4781	IT'S S TALKING ABOUT THEM JUST MILLIMETER MILLILITERS
Line_4782	TEN TEN MAKE A LITER
Line_4783	THEY'RE SEEING HOW MUCH MILLILITERS YOU OF WATER IN YOUR CUP
Line_4784	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_4785	RE A LITER OR NO UM A A RULER I THINK
Line_4786	T IT'S A SYRINGE WITH WATER IN IT AND IT'S GOTTA SQUEEZE OUT WATER
Line_4787	LOOK AT THIS YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE SYRINGE CAUSE IT SHOWS ON THE SYRINGE
Line_4788	IT REPRESENTS THE MILLIMETERS THAT THAT'S ON THE SYRINGE
Line_4789	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETERS AND LITERS AND SYRINGE AND LIKE GRADUATED CYLINDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4790	UM IT WAS IT I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_4791	THAT IT ENDED UP BEING A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4792	IT SHOWS HOW MUCH MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE I GUESS
Line_4793	A GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_4794	YOU MEASURE WA WELL YOU MEASURE MILLILITERS AND
Line_4795	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4796	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT
Line_4797	YEAH JUST BY LOOKING AT IT KIND OF
Line_4798	YOU COULD JUST WRITE THAT A B C D ON A CUP AND ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE
Line_4799	THAT THE FIRST CUP THE FIRST CUP IS BIGGER HAS MORE WATER THAN THE SECOND CUP
Line_4800	THAT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU HAVE
Line_4801	JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUID
Line_4802	UM MA MA MA MA MA MA MA MA I DON'T KNOW
Line_4803	UM I THINK IT KEEPS FULL
Line_4804	THAT THEY WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT LIKE KINDS OF VOLUME MEASUREMENT
Line_4805	THAT IT'S FATTER BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME MASS OF VOLUME OR YEAH VOLUME
Line_4806	THAT IF IT'S HOT OR COLD CAUSE YEAH IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_4807	WHICH ONE IS THE HOTTEST OR WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST OR ONE OF THOSE
Line_4808	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4809	YOU FEEL DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF CELSEITE AND FAHRENHEIT CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT
Line_4810	I THINK IT'S A THERMOMETER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME BUT I THINK
Line_4811	FOUR UH ACTUALLY NEVERMIND
Line_4812	NOTHING REALLY THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
Line_4813	IT'S ABOUT HOT NOT COLD I THINK I'M NOT SURE
Line_4814	GETTING THE ANSWER OF CELSIUS
Line_4815	CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF TOOL YOU USE IN THE UNIT TEMPERATURE
Line_4816	THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THE SAME
Line_4817	IT TURNS INTO FAHRENHEIT
Line_4818	THAT THE FIRST ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A HUNDRED CELSIUS AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIFTY FIVE CELSIUS
Line_4819	THAT THE SECOND ONE IS A LOT COLDER THAN THE FIRST ONE
Line_4820	THAT IT'S LIKE COUNTING BY TENS LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY
Line_4821	UM THE THERMOMETER GOES DOWN I GUESS
Line_4822	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER MAYBE
Line_4823	THAT IT GOES FROM UM FROM S FROM FIVE TO SIX TO NINE AND THEN TO THIRTEEN
Line_4824	THERE WAS A HUNDRED MINUTES A HUNDRED MINUTES I GUESS
Line_4825	THE INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER CHART THAT WE ACTUALLY USED TO WRITE ON
Line_4826	TEMPERATURE AND MINUTES THAT IT IS FROM
Line_4827	THE TEMP THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN AND CHANGED THE DEGREE CELSIUS
Line_4828	YOU COULD ESTIMATE OR STICK YOUR FINGER IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4829	URE BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER AND GUESS WELL YOU WELL JUST YEAH BY JUST BY LOOKING AT IT
Line_4830	IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE THERMOMETER OR THE NUMBER LINE
Line_4831	THAT IT TURNS COLD TO IT TURNS PRETTY COLD AND IT GOES DOWN TO DEGREES CELSISE
Line_4832	THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE YEAH
Line_4833	A THERMOMETER TELLS YOU UM THE TEMPERATURE CHANGED
Line_4834	LOOKING AT BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER
Line_4835	THAT IT'S D DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IN EACH ONE
Line_4836	UM THE WATER IS GETTING HOTTER AND COLDER
Line_4837	YES READY
Line_4838	I'VE BEEN UM
Line_4839	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4840	THE VOLUME OR HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_4841	IT'S HOW UM LONG IT IS FROM LIKE THE FRONT TO THE BACK
Line_4842	IT TELLS ME HOW UM LONG IT IS ACROSS
Line_4843	OF THE THE LENGTH OF THE DESK
Line_4844	I USED THE STRAW AND UH MEASURING TAPE
Line_4845	MEASURING HOW UM LONG UM
Line_4846	THEY AND EVERY BODY ELSE GOT DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS IN EACH GROUP
Line_4847	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
Line_4848	SOME ARE SOME ARE SHORTER AND UM GROUP A IS UM LONGER THAN GROUP B BECAUSE UM
Line_4849	IT MEANS THAT IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU THINK
Line_4850	THEY'RE BOTH OF THE SAME IN IN EACH GROUP
Line_4851	UM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE UM THE SAME THING ON EACH GROUP
Line_4852	I UM GOT SOME WATER INSIDE THE SYRINGE AND THEN I UM PUSHED IT OUT INTO THE CUP
Line_4853	I CAN USE A SYRINGE
Line_4854	THE CAPACITY IS UM A HUNDRED
Line_4855	THERE'S A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4856	THEY ALL MEASURE UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4857	IT'S TWO MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_4858	THEY'RE BOTH THEY'RE BOTH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WAT
Line_4859	THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH THE UM THE CUP CAN HOLD
Line_4860	IT'S HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL
Line_4861	THE VOLUME OF HOW MUCH IT COULD FILL AND THE VOLUME WAS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLILITERS BUT THE ACTUAL THING WAS UM THREE HUNDRED UM SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS
Line_4862	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS IN CAPACITY
Line_4863	IT SAID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_4864	IT'S UM THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS VOLUME OF LIQUID
Line_4865	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_4866	THEY'RE BOTH VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT
Line_4867	STILL LABELED WITH UM TEN MILLILITERS BY UM EACH FOR EACH LINE
Line_4868	I WOULD USE THE CAPACITY IN MILLILITERS
Line_4869	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_4870	I UM WENT
Line_4871	B WAS COLDEST A WAS UM W A LITTLE MORE WARMER AND C WAS WARMEST
Line_4872	WHICH UM CUP IS HOTTEST AND WHICH CUP IS COLDEST
Line_4873	UM A IS THE SAME AS C AND UM B IS ZERO DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_4874	IT'S HOW HOT OR COLD
Line_4875	IT'S A THERMOMETER AND UM IT CAN UM FEEL HOW UM HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4876	UM MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD S SOME LIQUIDS ARE
Line_4877	THE THERMOMETER IS MORE ACCURATE
Line_4878	IT'S DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_4879	CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT
Line_4880	THE MIDDLE OF FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS IS TEN AND TEN DEGREES CELSIUS IS THIRTY DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_4881	GOOD
Line_4882	IT UM IT DROPS THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4883	I SAW THAT IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER THAN UM EVERY MINUTE IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_4884	IT HAPPENED EVERY ONE MINUTE
Line_4885	IT WAS UM TWENTY DEGREES TO FIVE DEGREES
Line_4886	IT JUST STAYED ON DEGREES BUT IT NEVER WENT BACK UP
Line_4887	THE TEMPERATURE AND UM THE TIME IN MINUTES
Line_4888	UM THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4889	IT'S GETTING MUCH BIGGER
Line_4890	IT DROPPED UM FIFTEEN DEGREES
Line_4891	I'M COUNTING THE LINES ALL THE WAY
Line_4892	WELL IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET WATER OUT OF A CUP CAUSE ALL'S YOU HAVE TO DO IS POUR
Line_4893	WELL IT GOES TEN MIL MILLILITERS TWENTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLILITERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4894	UM MY GUESS IS THAT OKAY SO MY GUESS IS THAT YOU USE THAT TO MEASURE HOW MUCH WATER YOU NEED TO POUR IN EITHER UP TO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS OR NINETY LITERS EIGHTY MILLILITERS SEVENTY MILLILITERS SIXTY MILLILITERS FIFTY MILLILITERS FORTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLILITERS TWENTY MILLILITERS AND TEN MILLILITERS AND DO YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU SHOULD NEED FOR EVERYTHING
Line_4895	GOING UP TO THE RIM BY FILLING UP TO THE RIM R
Line_4896	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I NOTICED MARNIE
Line_4897	UM MARNIE WHAT AS I ALREADY SAID TO YOU I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS I KNOW I NEED TO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4898	I GOT TO GO MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH OKAY BYE
Line_4899	IT'S HOW MUCH A C WATER A CUP OR SOMETHING CAN HOLD
Line_4900	THAT THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS FOR THE CAPACITY
Line_4901	MMM MARNIE I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_4902	UM AND SO ARE YOU ASKING WHAT DID I DO OR WHAT DID MY GROUP DO OR WHAT TO DO
Line_4903	THAT TELLS HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE CAN IS UM YEAH
Line_4904	UM WELL
Line_4905	OKAY HEY MARNIE I HAVE TO GO NOW OKAY
Line_4906	AND SO AFTER WE STUCK OUR FINGERS IN THE W THE WATER OF THE CUPS WE
Line_4907	WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS
Line_4908	I KNOW THAT'S LIKE HOW HOT OR HOW COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4909	WE PUT IN THERMOMETERS UM SO WE PUT IN THERMOMETERS
Line_4910	I CAN'T TELL WHAT THE THE WHAT B IS BUT
Line_4911	UM THAT C MEANS CELSIUS
Line_4912	WELL UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4913	WELL I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT CELSIUS REALLY MEANS YET CAUSE WE JUST STARTED OUR TE STARTED ON TEMPERATURE UNIT SO
Line_4914	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARNIE
Line_4915	UM I'M DONE
Line_4916	LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE SIGNS THAT SAY FIVE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BUT YOU LOOK AT THE RED STUFF THAT GOES UP
Line_4917	UM WELL THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE RIGHT ARE HIGHER THAN THE ONES ON THE LE
Line_4918	OH I'M DOING ALRIGHT COULD SAY I'M GOOD
Line_4919	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURE
Line_4920	THE ICE MADE THE WATER COLD
Line_4921	AND SO WHEN WE PUT THE ICE CUBES IN THAT MADE THE WATER MUCH MORE COLDER THAN IT WAS
Line_4922	OKAY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_4923	A UM AND SO THEY CAN GET SUPER COLD AND TURN INTO ICE CUBE
Line_4924	THAT RELATES LIKE A THERMO YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT THE THERMOMETER INSIDE IT BECAUSE IT CAUSE THE REALLY COLD WATER TURNS INTO AN ICE CUBE
Line_4925	AND SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN MAYBE A PEN OR PENCIL AND THEN YOU CAN WRITE YOUR RESULTS ON THE PAPER
Line_4926	WELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID MARNIE UM
Line_4927	MMM WE DIDN'T REALLY DRAW OUR DATA BUT WE WROTE OUR DATA
Line_4928	I DON'T REALLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT GRAPHS MARNIE
Line_4929	MMM FOR EXAMPLE NINETY DEGREES
Line_4930	THEY'RE THE MINUTES THAT IT TOOK EVERY TIME WE MEASURE
Line_4931	IT'S BECAUSE THEY MEASURED IT A LOT OF TIMES AND THEN THE TEMPERATURE CUP CHANGING A LITTLE
Line_4932	I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4933	WE OBSERVED CHANGES MAYBE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTE
Line_4934	MMM I DON'T I'M I DON'T KNOW A S A LOT LOT MARNIE
Line_4935	WELL I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT I WROTE DOWN MARNIE
Line_4936	I THINK IT WAS LIKE MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS I
Line_4937	MARNIE I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE NOW BYE BYE
Line_4938	HELLO MY NAME IS KENDRA WHAT'S YOURS BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLEE BLEE
Line_4939	YES I DO SEE THE LITTLE BELOW YOUR HEAD
Line_4940	UM YES I IT IS ON
Line_4941	NO YOU DID NOT REPEAT YOURSELF
Line_4942	YES I DO GET THAT
Line_4943	UM WELL WE JUST STARTED A NEW UNIT ABOUT MEASURING WITH THE METRIC SYSTEM AND BEFORE THAT WE WERE DOING GEOMETRY
Line_4944	I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LENGTH IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4945	THEY WERE DIFFERENT SI SIZES SO EVERYONE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_4946	I UM I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_4947	I AM GOOD MARNIE THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4948	UM THE FLOOR UP TO DOORKNOB
Line_4949	THEY ARE ALL THE METRIC THEY ALL UNITS OF THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_4950	EVERY RU UM PLACES OF THE UNITED STATES USES THE METRIC SYSTEM TO UM MEASURE STUFF
Line_4951	UM I DO NOT KNOW WHY
Line_4952	WHAT YOU COULD ESTIMATE ESTIMATE WHICH IS BASICALLY LIKE UM MAKING A REALLY SMART GUESS
Line_4953	UM IT'S TEN INCHES
Line_4954	THIRTY THIRTY INCHES WIDE AND TWENTY INCHES UM TALL
Line_4955	THREE INCHES
Line_4956	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4957	UM TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_4958	B YOU GET BE BETTER AT WHATEVER YOU'RE PRACTICING AT
Line_4959	CAUSE YOU KEEP ON DOING IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YOU GET BETTER BETTER EACH TIME
Line_4960	UM SO YOU I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4961	GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4962	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4963	THAT IS A Q THAT IS A QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_4964	MA YOU MEASURE IT MORE THAN ONCE CAUSE UM YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_4965	YOUR PINK THE PINK THE PERSON'S PINKIE IS ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4966	IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_4967	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4968	I AM NOT SURE
Line_4969	MMM THE THEY ARE BOTH THE SAME LENGTHS
Line_4970	THEY ARE ALMOST THE SAME LENGTHS
Line_4971	UM SOME OF THEM ARE THE SAME LENGTHS
Line_4972	CENTIMETERS
Line_4973	THEY HAVE CENTIMETERS ON THEM
Line_4974	I DON'T I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4975	I AM GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4976	STUDY ABOUT THE METRIC SYSTEM AND SO UM IT KIND OF AND THE METRIC SYSTEM HAS THE IS MEASURING IT HAS HAS UM THE LIKE WEIGHING THING BUT OUR TEACHER PLAYED A TRICK ON US LIKE CAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS THAT WE USED WERE DIFFERENT SIZES SO OUR TABLE GOT A DIFFERENT UM ANSWER BUT THEN SHE GAVE US GRAMS WHICH IS A METRIC UNIT AND UM SO AND THEN EVERYONE
Line_4977	CAUSE THEY'RE MADE OUT OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_4978	WHAT THEY WERE MADE OF MAY BE
Line_4979	YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH WHICH ONE'S HEAVIER
Line_4980	I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4981	YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS THE PLASTIC CHIP IS
Line_4982	UH YOU ARE U USING A MEASURING TOOL LIKE YOU'RE M USING A I'M FORGET WHAT A SCALE
Line_4983	I MMM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4984	THE TEACHER TRICKED US CAUSE UM WE DISCOVERED UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4985	UM WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND GRAMS
Line_4986	I DON'T KNOW ONE'S BIGGER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4987	THEY WOULD BE DIFFERENT
Line_4988	EVERYONE WOULD D GET A DIFFERENT RESULT
Line_4989	UM I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
Line_4990	IT'S SHOWING A CUBE AND IT'S SAYING IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_4991	I'M NOT UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_4992	BYE TOO BYE BYE
Line_4993	METRIC SYSTEM UNITS
Line_4994	UM YOU'RE MEASURING WHAT THAT THINGAMABOB IS HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4995	MEASURING SOMETHING DUH
Line_4996	THAT WEIGHS EIGHT EIGHT GRAMS CAN I PLEASE GO NOW
Line_4997	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4998	THE ORANGE IS TOO HEAVY
Line_4999	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5000	IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_5001	YOU'LL GET THE SAME ANSWER HOPEFULLY
Line_5002	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5003	BLANK BLANK BLANK
Line_5004	ME DON'T KNOW
Line_5005	IT'S THREE IT'S THIRTY GRAMS
Line_5006	IT IS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5007	PUT ON ON
Line_5008	TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY GRAMS IT IS
Line_5009	ME DO NOT KNOW
Line_5010	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5011	BLAH BLAH BLAH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5012	WHO KNOWS WHO
Line_5013	WHAT'S A LITER BEAKER
Line_5014	UM WE DID NOT DO THE MEASUREMENT WAS ONE THOUSAND WHATEVER
Line_5015	UM WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_5016	I HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY USED A MILLILITER
Line_5017	UM MMM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_5018	UM WHICH ONE'S WHICH AGAIN
Line_5019	UM MMM THERE'S SO MANY IT'S HARD TO CHOOSE
Line_5020	UM WHAT'D YOU SAY
Line_5021	DIDN'T HEAR YOU I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
Line_5022	UM A NUMBER S SAYING HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_5023	UM PARDON
Line_5024	UM WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WATER WILL FIT IN THE CUP
Line_5025	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5026	UM I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_5027	M I FORGET WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE
Line_5028	WELL WE DIDN'T SQUIRT IT OUT OF THE CUP WE SQUIRTED IT INTO THE CUP
Line_5029	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS ARE THERE
Line_5030	FIFTY MILLILITERS
Line_5031	MMM IT IT'S A HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT'S VOLUME IS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5032	IT TELLS YOU IT'S BASICALLY LIKE THE SYRINGE IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IS IN IT
Line_5033	UM YOU MEASURE STUFF UM YOU MEASURE THE VOLUME OF STUFF THAT
Line_5034	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY USE MY BRAIN
Line_5035	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5036	UM THEY HAVE LINES ON THEM A TO B
Line_5037	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5038	I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5039	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5040	UM I DON'T REALLY HEAR YOU
Line_5041	UM TH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5042	IT WEIGHS TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER
Line_5043	UM IT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER
Line_5044	UM WE'VE BEEN D
Line_5045	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5046	I IF THAT'S NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5047	BLAH BLAH BLAH THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EXCUSE ME THAT'S HOW YOU SOUND TO ME
Line_5048	S IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS INSIDE OF IT
Line_5049	THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS I MEAN IT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLILITER IS INSIDE THE SODA IS THE AMOUNT OF SODA INSIDE
Line_5050	WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_5051	UM REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST IT WAS TELLING YOU THE VOLUME OF THE CAN
Line_5052	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY UH H
Line_5053	UM I NOTICED THAT'S NOT ALL THE WAY FILLED TO THE TOP DUH
Line_5054	THEY THERE'S A SYRINGE A GRADUATED A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND A LITER
Line_5055	UM I YOU FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH S HOW MUCH LIQUID IS INSIDE SOMETHING
Line_5056	WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_5057	UM WHAT'S
Line_5058	UM OUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW
Line_5059	UM THEY ADD UP THE LAST STEP FOR THEM IS TO ADD IT UP
Line_5060	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5061	HI MY NAME IS NICKY AND I'M NINE
Line_5062	MEASURING IS ABOUT UM LIKE MEASURING IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT MEASURING IS ABOUT
Line_5063	I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG THAT IS THE THING YOU ASKED ME TO MEASURE IS
Line_5064	I USED A STRAW AND THEN I USED UM A MEASURING TAPE WITH UM CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5065	YOU GOT UH A MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWER SO IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD UM STRATEGY TO USE STRAWS
Line_5066	GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_5067	IN MATH WE'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_5068	UM YOU MEASURE STUFF WITH METERS AND THAT THAT'S BASICALLY ALL OF IT LIKE YOU JUST MEASURE STUFF
Line_5069	UM BECAUSE IF YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER
Line_5070	UM MY THE HEIGHTS OF MY DESK
Line_5071	UM FROM THE GROUND TO THE DOORKNOB
Line_5072	THEY ALL HAVE CENTIMETERS IN 'EM
Line_5073	UM BECAUSE LIKE M IN LIKE I FORGET
Line_5074	YOU WOULD ESTIMATE BECAUSE YOU WOULD ESTIMATE
Line_5075	UM ESTIMATING IS AN EDUCATED GUESS
Line_5076	IT IS THREE UNITS
Line_5077	I FORGET
Line_5078	YOU CAN KEEP PRACTICING AND THEN YOUR ESTIMATES WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER
Line_5079	YOU WOULD GET BETTER BECAUSE YOU WOULD JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND YOU WOULD GET MORE USED TO IT
Line_5080	YOU USE A RULER OR A METER STICK OR LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_5081	YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS
Line_5082	UM YOU WOULD YOU MEASURED IT TWICE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LIKE METER IF YOU HAD A ME METER MEASURING UM TAPE THEN IT WILL KIND OF GO LIKE
Line_5083	TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT
Line_5084	I FORGET I THINK
Line_5085	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5086	YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT
Line_5087	THE PERSON IS MEASURING HIS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5088	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5089	UM IT'S A I FOR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5090	I MEASURED FROM MY WRIST TO MY ELBOW
Line_5091	BUT MY ARM SPAN AND MY HEIGHTH
Line_5092	I SEE THAT HER NOSE AND HER EAR ARE THE SAME LENGTH
Line_5093	AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH
Line_5094	YOU YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5095	YOU USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5096	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5097	THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER
Line_5098	YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER
Line_5099	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5100	YOU WOULD NEED TO
Line_5101	I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
Line_5102	IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT WHEN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5103	IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5104	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5105	I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5106	YOU UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK
Line_5107	I FOR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5108	UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISK
Line_5109	BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_5110	I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM
Line_5111	WE USED PAPER CLIPS
Line_5112	THEN WE USED GRAMS TO TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL ANSWER
Line_5113	THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUBE THAT IS ONE GRAM
Line_5114	YOU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHTS OF THINGS
Line_5115	UM IT WAS ONE GRAM
Line_5116	IT WAS EIGHT GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISK WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5117	THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5118	IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5119	GRAMS ARE THE UM METRIC SYSTEM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK
Line_5120	YOU CAN F YOU I DON'T KNOW
Line_5121	YOU UM SO YOU I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE I KIND OF SAID IT ALL
Line_5122	SO UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5123	IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5124	THE CAR IN THE PICTURE WEIGHS SEVENTY GRAMS
Line_5125	YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
Line_5126	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5127	A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOMETHING'S LESS THAN A GRAM
Line_5128	ONE THOUSAND
Line_5129	I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5130	YOU WOULD USE IT WHEN THERE LIKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND
Line_5131	YOU WOULD GET A REALLY ACCURATE UM ANSWER
Line_5132	I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT A DRY SPONGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL LIKE Z ABSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER
Line_5133	A SOAKED SPONGE UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5134	THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SOAKED SPONGE
Line_5135	IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER
Line_5136	WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_5137	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE
Line_5138	I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5139	YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT
Line_5140	I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND THAT BUT THAT IT WAS THREE GRAMS
Line_5141	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5142	UM THE S I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UP UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5143	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED
Line_5144	I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5145	YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
Line_5146	YOU USE GRAMS
Line_5147	YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD TA YOU TAKE A
Line_5148	IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS
Line_5149	YOU CAN USE A VIAL
Line_5150	I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST VIAL IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND VIAL
Line_5151	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE METRIC UNITS ARE FOR MEASURING VOLUME
Line_5152	IT'S A LITER
Line_5153	A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO MILLILITERS
Line_5154	MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN UM MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER
Line_5155	I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM MMM ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS ON THEM
Line_5156	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER
Line_5157	ARE ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER
Line_5158	TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LITER
Line_5159	THE PLASTIC CUP
Line_5160	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5161	UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5162	IT'S A SYRINGE WITH UM WATER IN IT
Line_5163	IT MAKES THEM GOOD CAUSE YOU CAN SUCK UP A VERY PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5164	UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REPRESENT
Line_5165	WE FIGURED OUT THE VOLUME BY USING A SYRINGE AND UM A GRADUATED CYLINDER O
Line_5166	THAT OBJECT IS A SYRINGE AND IT HAS FORTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5167	THAT TOOL IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER
Line_5168	I NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5169	YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER S B YEAH
Line_5170	CAPACITY IS UM AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPPY TIP TOP LIKE YEAH
Line_5171	I NOTICED THAT UM AT THE CUP'S CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT
Line_5172	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5173	IT'S WHEN YOU IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE WATER
Line_5174	THEY'RE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSELS
Line_5175	TH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5176	I OBSERVED THAT THE TALL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5177	I LEARNED THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5178	I'M WELL
Line_5179	IN MATH WE SAW WE TRIED TO SEE IF
Line_5180	I OBSERVED THAT IT'S AT ITS CAPACITY AND ITS CAPACITY IS THREE HUN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5181	YOU COULD USE WATER TO HELP FIGURE OUT THE CAMPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5182	I NOTICED THAT THE LIQUID ISN'T ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5183	THE PRINTED NUMBER TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN
Line_5184	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5185	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5186	THAT IS THE CAMPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5187	IT STANDS FOR THE CAMPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5188	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5189	I OBSERVED THAT THE CAMPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5190	THERE'S A SYRINGE A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND A LITER A LITER LIKE CUP THING
Line_5191	YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH UM LIQUID IS IN SOMETHING
Line_5192	WE U THE METRIC SYSTEM USES MILLILITERS AND RIGHT NOW IN SCHOOL WE ONLY USED MILLILITERS
Line_5193	YOU YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED
Line_5194	IS DOING A MATH EQUATION TO GET YOU TO YOUR ANSWER
Line_5195	SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5196	I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS I DIDN'T REALLY DISCOVER ANYTHING
Line_5197	YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CUP A CUP B OR CUP C'S W WATER WAS WARMER
Line_5198	YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER
Line_5199	I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT W UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN BETWEEN
Line_5200	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5201	I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
Line_5202	WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN
Line_5203	YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5204	IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH
Line_5205	ON C THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES
Line_5206	YOU U WE'RE USING CELSIUS IN THIS UNIT
Line_5207	IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN
Line_5208	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5209	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5210	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5211	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_5212	WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER
Line_5213	WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER
Line_5214	UM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY
Line_5215	UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT WENT IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH
Line_5216	I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT MUCH COLDER
Line_5217	IT DROPS LOWER
Line_5218	IT DROPPED FIFTEEN CELSIUS
Line_5219	THEY CAN FREEZE
Line_5220	IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S KINDA LIKE CONTRACTING AND SO YEAH
Line_5221	YOU CAN WRITE IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5222	I DISPLAYED IT BY WRITING IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5223	I DREW UM MY DATA AND NUMBERS ON A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
Line_5224	YEAH
Line_5225	I THE PARTS OF THE GRAPHED I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_5226	GRAPHS ARE TO HELP YOU UM LIKE MEASURE AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR STUFF
Line_5227	YOU PUT NUMBERS ON THE SIDE
Line_5228	IT HELPS YOU KEEP TRACK OF LIKE TEN MINUTES IT'S FIVE DEGREES TWENTY MINUTES IT'S THIRTY DEGREES LIKE THAT
Line_5229	YOU CAN USE IT TO GET I DON'T KNOW
Line_5230	I PUT LIKE HOW IT DROPPED AND HOW IT HOW IT DROPPED IN TEMPERATURE AND HOW IT WENT UP IN TEMPERATURE
Line_5231	THEY'RE ABOUT LIKE ABOUT I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_5232	IT WENT DOWN REALLY FAR AND THEN IT'S GOING UP
Line_5233	IT HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW HOW IT RISES IN TIME AND HOW IT DROPS IN TIME
Line_5234	FOR TEN MINUTES
Line_5235	IT GOES UP AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5236	IT'S GETTING COLDER AND WARMER
Line_5237	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5238	AND THEN YOU WOULD ADD 'EM TOGETHER AND GET YOUR ANSWER OF HOW MA DIFFERENCE IT WAS
Line_5239	YOU CAN COUNT THE DEGREES CELSIUS IT DROPPED
Line_5240	IT'S WHEN IT EITHER GOES DOWN UM THE RED STUFF GOES DOWN ON A THERMOMETER OR UP
Line_5241	UM THE TEMPERATURE IS CHANGING
Line_5242	HI MY NAME IS SYLVIE
Line_5243	YES I DO
Line_5244	I I PRESSED THE REPEAT BUTTON
Line_5245	YES IT DOES
Line_5246	UM MEASURING IS WHEN WELL
Line_5247	MEASURING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE HOW LONG SOMETHING IS OR
Line_5248	I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_5249	OR IT'S METH MEASURING
Line_5250	I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE
Line_5251	ONE IS LONGER THAN THE OTHER BUT I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW
Line_5252	IN MATH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND WE ARE DOING A LOT OF FUN STUFF IN MATH
Line_5253	UM IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR TO THE DOORKNOB
Line_5254	THEY'RE ALL FROM THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_5255	YOU CAN ESTIMATE
Line_5256	SO YOU DON'T EXACTLY NEED TO USE YOUR FOOT OR YOUR ARM OR THE WIDTH OF YOUR PINKIE YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT IT AND SAY HMMM I THINK THAT IS ABOUT A FOOT LONG
Line_5257	YOU CAN WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5258	OR GUESSING WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Line_5259	WELL YOU CAN USE YOUR FINGER TO
Line_5260	YOU CAN USE A MEASURE TAPE OR A RULER OR A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK OR A FEET OR INCHES
Line_5261	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5262	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTION BUT
Line_5263	SO YOU CAN JUST DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT
Line_5264	IT WAS VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND EASY
Line_5265	AND WAIT
Line_5266	OTHER THAN THAT IT IS GOOD
Line_5267	FOR THAT I USE A MEASURING TAPE SO IT WAS EASIER THAN USING A METER STICK
Line_5268	THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG
Line_5269	PINKIE IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG SO IF YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS LIKE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5270	YESTERDAY WE MEASURED WHICH ONE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE LIGHTEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5271	THE THE UM THE METAL DISK IS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASTIC DISK
Line_5272	PLASTIC SHOULD BE LIGHTER THAN METAL
Line_5273	YOU CAN MEASURE INSTEAD OF ESTIMATING
Line_5274	THE BALANCE AND MAYBE MY HANDS
Line_5275	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5276	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5277	IT SAYS THAT SOMETHING EQUALS ONE GROUP
Line_5278	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5279	THAT THE THAT THE STUFF WE U THE MATERIALS THAT WE USED WERE HEAVIER
Line_5280	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANY MEASUREMENT IN MATH
Line_5281	WE'VE BEEN USING THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_5282	THE LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD ON THE RED CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5283	IT TELLS ME THAT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5284	MAYBE A DOORKNOB IN ONE CUP AND KEEP ON PUTTING THE GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY THEY WEIGH
Line_5285	THE PLASTIC DISK IS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP FOUR THE PLASTIC DISK IS FOUR SMALL PAPER CLIPS AND IT AND THE PLASTIC DISK IS TWO GRAMS PLASTIC DISK IS TWO BIG PAPER CLIPS AND THE PLASTIC DISK IS
Line_5286	YOU CAN ESTIMATE HOW TALL OR HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_5287	KNOW WHAT A REFERENCE IS YET
Line_5288	THEY'RE REFERENCES I'M GUESSING
Line_5289	THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5290	YOU NEED SEVENTY GRAMS TO MEASURE THIS CAR TO MAKE IT COMPLETELY MEASURED
Line_5291	CAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SMALL GRAM PIECES AND IT WON'T MEASUREMENT STRAIGHTLY
Line_5292	MAYBE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW HOW HOW HEAVY IT IS FOR A RECIPE OR SOMETHING IN A COOKBOOK
Line_5293	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_5294	GET A ONE HUNDRED GRAM PIECE OR USE A DIFFERENT THING THAN A BALANCE BEAM
Line_5295	THE ORANGE IS
Line_5296	YOU NEE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5297	THE GRAVEL IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAMS
Line_5298	SO THEY MEASURE EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5299	I HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT KILOGRAMS YET
Line_5300	YOU USE IT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT'S TOO HEAVY TO USE FOR GRAMS
Line_5301	HEAVIER THAN HEAVIER THAN A BOOK
Line_5302	I HAVE TO GO GOODBYE
Line_5303	IT'S GOING VERY WELL
Line_5304	WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING MUCH MEASUREMENT BUT WE'VE BEEN BALANCING THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN USING A BALANCE
Line_5305	WELL IT'S DRY SO IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS A SPONGE WITH THAT WAS WET SO IT'S PRETTY LIGHT
Line_5306	A WET SPONGE IS A SPONGE WELL UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5307	WHEN IT SUCKS UP ALL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP
Line_5308	YOU PUT IT ON A BALANCE AND THEN YOU JUST KEEP ON PUTTING
Line_5309	UM THE THE DRY SPONGE E EQUALS THREE GRAMS CAUSE IT'S LEVELED OUT ON THE BALANCE
Line_5310	THE WET SPONGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE CAUSE THE WET SPONGE SPONGE HAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT
Line_5311	THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5312	THE WET SPONGE IS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5313	A THE WET SPONGE IS SIXTEEN GRAMS AND THE DRY SPONGE IS ONLY THREE GRAMS SO THE WET SPONGE SUCKED UP ALL THE WATER AND THAT'S WHY IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE
Line_5314	THE SPONGE HELD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5315	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5316	VERY GOOD I AM VERY VERY GOOD
Line_5317	WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH AN EMPTY CUP
Line_5318	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_5319	THAT THE CUP CAN HOLD THAT MANY VIALS OF WATER INSIDE OF IT
Line_5320	YOU COULD USE VIALS
Line_5321	E GROUP ONE IS BIGGER THAN GROUP TWO
Line_5322	IT WOULD NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS THAN OTHER PEOPLE
Line_5323	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT IN CLASS SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5324	IT'S JUST MARKING THE SPOT
Line_5325	THERE'S ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS FILLED UP IN THAT
Line_5326	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN ONE LITER
Line_5327	HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN A CUP OR HOW MUCH JUICE OR SOMETHING
Line_5328	THERE'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN ONE LITER
Line_5329	YOU COULD USE A SYRINGE
Line_5330	BY LOOKING AT THE SIDES AND THE SIDE HAS LITTLE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE SO
Line_5331	UM WELL ACTUALLY YESTERDAY I WASN'T THERE FOR SCIENCE SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5332	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T HERE YESTERDAY IN SCIENCE
Line_5333	I DON'T KNOW HOW I FIGURED OUT VOLUME
Line_5334	WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT A CYLINDER OR A SYRINGE
Line_5335	I THINK IT'S CALLED A SYRINGE
Line_5336	I DIDN'T USE A SYRINGE
Line_5337	I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A SYRINGE CAN HOLD
Line_5338	I DON'T KNOW I NEVER WORKED WITH THIS THE OTHER DAY SO
Line_5339	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT TOOL
Line_5340	I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD DESCRIBE THAT
Line_5341	WE COULD MEASURE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER
Line_5342	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT I'M JUST GUESSING NOTHING
Line_5343	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5344	THAT'S TOO HARD I DON'T KNOW
Line_5345	ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
Line_5346	UM THE SECOND CUP IS DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE FIRST CUP
Line_5347	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5348	THE SODA INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN ONLY FILLS UP TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_5349	YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA CAN AND IT SAYS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF SODA IS IN THERE
Line_5350	YOU NOTICED THAT IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT'S ONLY FILLED MOSTLY TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL THE WAY
Line_5351	THE PRINTED NUMBER IS TELLING YOU THAT THE AMOUNT OF SODA THAT IS IN THAT CAN IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5352	THERE'S WELL THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF LIQUID INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5353	THE LIQUID OF THE VOLUME IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5354	AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5355	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT OR THE SAME
Line_5356	THERE'S A SYRINGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THING IN THE MIDDLE IS BUT THE TOP IS ONE LITER
Line_5357	UM THERE IS NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MAKES ONE LITER
Line_5358	I WOULD USE A SYRINGE INSTEAD OF SOMETHING ELSE
Line_5359	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO THAT BUT MARNIE I'M GOING TO GO NOW BYE BYE
Line_5360	WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST AND WHICH ONE'S IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5361	UM ONE IS WARMER OR HOTTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5362	TO SEE HOW HOT COLD OR WARM SOMETHING IS
Line_5363	BECAUSE FINGERS DON'T WORK
Line_5364	IT MEASURES THE WEIGHT OR TEMPERATURE OR LENGTH OF SOMETHING
Line_5365	I THINK THE UNIT'S CALLED CELSIUS
Line_5366	I DON'T KNOW THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT MAYBE LATER I WILL
Line_5367	THAT IT'S NOT AS COLD HOT I MEAN
Line_5368	HOT WATER IS WARMER THAN ICE WATER BECAUSE ICE IS IN THE WATER
Line_5369	TEN DEGREES CELSIUS INTO FIFTY DEGREES CELSIUS TEN DEGREES HAS ICE IN IT FIFTY DEGREES DOESN'T
Line_5370	WELL YOU'RE POURING ICE WATER INTO WARM WATER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
Line_5371	IT WOULD GET WARM AND COLD THE ICE WATER WOULD MAKE THE WARM WATER COLDER BUT THE WARM WATER WOULD MAKE THE ICE WATER WARMER
Line_5372	YOU COULD ESTIMATE
Line_5373	WELL I NEVER FIGURED THAT OUT
Line_5374	IT'S GOING VERY GOOD
Line_5375	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5376	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS
Line_5377	WELL WHEN I DID IT I USED A THERMOMETER
Line_5378	IT'S LITTLE SQUARES IT'S GOT THE AREA IN THE UM
Line_5379	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YET
Line_5380	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5381	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THAT IS
Line_5382	IT'S GOING DOWN OR UP
Line_5383	SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES OR SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES
Line_5384	UM A COUPLE OF MINUTES
Line_5385	YOU COULD USE THE THERMOMETER OR YOUR FINGERS FI YOUR FINGERS AREN'T THE BEST UM WAY TO BUT IT IS ONE WAY
Line_5386	TWO CELSIUS DOWN
Line_5387	WE LOOKED AT IT AND THEN WE RECORDED IT ON A PAPER
Line_5388	YOU COULD READ THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE THE MARKS CAUSE THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5389	THE S THE UM THE RED PART GOES DOWN OR UP BUT IF IT STAYS THEN IT'S NOT CHANGING
Line_5390	WHATEVER IS IN THE WATER THE MERTERIALS ICE HOT WATER THAT MAKES IT CHANGE
Line_5391	STUDYING MAGNETISM AND PLAYING WITH MAGNETS
Line_5392	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASSROOM WE DID THIS EXACT SAME THING AND UM THAT HAPPENED
Line_5393	WELL THERE'S A WIRE A SWITCH A BASE
Line_5394	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT WON'T LET THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH
Line_5395	WE'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH CIRCUITS WITH BATTERIES WIRES AND MOTORS OR LIGHTS AND UH SWITCH
Line_5396	I PUT THE STRAW IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A STRIP OF METAL
Line_5397	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5398	I ACTUALLY JUST REMEMBERED THAT I ALUMINUM DOES STICK BECAUSE IT IS METAL JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
Line_5399	NO NOT EXACTLY IT JUST KEEPS IT PEOPLE SAFE FROM E ELECTROCUTING THEMSELVES OR GETTING SHOCKED OR GETTING UM HURT
Line_5400	BRASS HOLE I MEAN WASHER AND NOTHING ELSE
Line_5401	IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MAGNETS
Line_5402	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND USING CIRCUITS AND THEN TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5403	THE BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IN OUR CLASS TH WE COULDN'T GET 'EM TO
Line_5404	IT ALWAYS F COMES OUT OF NEGATIVE AND GOES INTO POSITIVE AND SO IT TRAVELS THROUGH AND SO YEAH
Line_5405	IT ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE NOT THE NEGATIVES AND IT ALWAYS COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE SO YEAH
Line_5406	THE BATTERY ALWAYS HAS TO G FLOW BACK INTO THE POSITIVE NOT NEGATIVE
Line_5407	LEARNING ABOUT THE WATER CYCLE
Line_5408	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5409	THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THROUGH THE PLANK OF WOOD
Line_5410	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_5411	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5412	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_5413	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP THAN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT
Line_5414	THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PATH NO TWO TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
Line_5415	THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED
Line_5416	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND DOWN INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5417	ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5418	I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE'S A NON PARALLEL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS
Line_5419	THAT IF IT'S THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5420	THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5421	THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5422	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER
Line_5423	WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH IT TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5424	THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
Line_5425	POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5426	WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND WHICH END'S ON THE NEGATIVE
Line_5427	THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP
Line_5428	I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SIDE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_5429	IT IS RIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM ARE NOT
Line_5430	THE CAN THE CON WHAT'S THAT
Line_5431	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_5432	A NAIL CAN MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE L SWITCH IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR S
Line_5433	ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL
Line_5434	WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
Line_5435	THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASTIC
Line_5436	I I'VE BEEN DOING SEEING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS CAN STICK
Line_5437	UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU FLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH 'EM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THEM APART
Line_5438	THE MAGNET FORCE ISN'T MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S UM IN BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
Line_5439	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
Line_5440	THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING ALREADY
Line_5441	WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES 'EM STICK AND IF YOU MOVE ONE IT MOVES
Line_5442	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING 'EM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5443	YES IT CAN GO THROUGH OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5444	THE MAGNETIC FORCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPERCLIP MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK
Line_5445	IRON IRON'S METAL OR STEEL
Line_5446	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5447	IT IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS FROM ONE BATTERY
Line_5448	WELL IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY AND ONE BATTERY YEAH
Line_5449	THAT ONE'S KINDA TOUGH FOR ME
Line_5450	IT THE ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5451	WELL ON THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_5452	THAT'S KINDA A TOUGH ONE FOR ME
Line_5453	THAT'S KINDA TOUGH ONE FOR ME
Line_5454	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5455	ELL THAT'S KINDA A TOUGH ONE FOR ME
Line_5456	WELL IF IT FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND INTO THE POSITIVE THEN AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
Line_5457	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5458	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNIE
Line_5459	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT MARNIE
Line_5460	THAT THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5461	THAT THERE'S ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONE SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5462	WHEN IT'S ON IT'S OFF AND WHEN IT'S OFF IT'S ON
Line_5463	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH
Line_5464	THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
Line_5465	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING
Line_5466	ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_5467	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_5468	WELL THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY CAN WORK WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KINDA CONNECT TO
Line_5469	THE RIVET CAN STAY MAGNETIC OH FOR QUITE SOME TIME
Line_5470	WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNIE
Line_5471	ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5472	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5473	IT'S A MAGNET THAT ATTRACTS IT'S UM OPPOSITE AND DOES NOT ATTRACT IT'S UM SAME
Line_5474	IT ATTRACTS THINGS WELL
Line_5475	IT'S ATTRACTING THINGS THAT ARE STEEL OR UM IRON
Line_5476	UM IT DOESN'T DO ANY M IT DOESN'T STICK TO ANY MATERIALS THAT AREN'T UM STEEL OR IRON
Line_5477	UM THERE'S IRON THERE'S STEEL THERE'S SOME ROCKS WOOD PLASTIC COPPER AND A SPONGE
Line_5478	UM WELL THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE UM SOME UM MOSTLY METAL AND YEAH
Line_5479	I THINK THAT IRON AND STEEL ARE ROCK SO IT MIGHT BE CONTAINING IN THAT ROCK
Line_5480	YOU ASKED ME THAT BUT UM IT IT STICKS TO IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY
Line_5481	UM MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL AND
Line_5482	UM THE ST THE STEEL NAIL UM STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL DOES NOT
Line_5483	AN ALUMINUM NAIL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S UM NOT REALLY LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT IS SUPPOSED TO GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_5484	UM THE ALUMINUM NAIL UM DOES NOT HAVE THE MATERIAL IN IT THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL DOES
Line_5485	M I THINK THAT UM THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TOGETHER ARE IN OPPOSITE SIDES AND THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER ARE
Line_5486	WORKING ON MAGNETS AND WATER
Line_5487	UM THERE'S ENOUGH WASHERS IN THE ONE SIDE THAT IT OVERPOWERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_5488	UM THE UM WASHERS HA ER THERE'S ENOUGH WASHERS THAT IT OVERPOWERS THE MAGNET
Line_5489	UM THEY THEY STILL ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT
Line_5490	BLOCKS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5491	THERE'S STILL A BIT OF MAGNETIC FIELD THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS STRONG AS IT WAS WHEN IT ONLY HAD LIKE A COUPLE SPACERS
Line_5492	UM IT'S CALLED MAGNETIC FIELD AND IT AND OPPOSITES OPPOSITES ATTRACT AND UM THE SAME DETRACTS
Line_5493	UM YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_5494	TWO BULBS AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH TWO CIRCUITS
Line_5495	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BRIGHTER AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT ISN'T BRIGHTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FORMATION
Line_5496	IT'S A LOT DIMMER
Line_5497	UM IT'S BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANOTHER ELECTRIC A BULB
Line_5498	UM THEY'RE THE ELECTRIC THEY'RE THE SYMBOL FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH THINGS
Line_5499	IT'S TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULBS
Line_5500	THERE'S ONE FOR EACH BULB
Line_5501	M IT GOES THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND IT JUST KEEPS GO TRAVELING IN A CIRCUIT FOR EACH SIDE
Line_5502	IF ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S EACH BULB HAS A SEPARATE THING
Line_5503	THE UH ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH AND IT'S GOING THROUGH ITS SEPARATE PATHWAY
Line_5504	PROBABLY A PARALLEL
Line_5505	ELECTRICITY IS RE RESEMBLED BY BLUE TRAVELING DOTS
Line_5506	UM I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5507	UM DO YOU MEAN STRING OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
Line_5508	UM THERE'S WASHERS THERE'S A D CELL BATTERY THERE'S A WIRE A SWITCH A HOLDER AND THIS STEEL ROD
Line_5509	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TO AND IT ATTRACTS THINGS IF IT'S A MAGNET
Line_5510	UM IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS CAUSE IT'S REALLY STRONG
Line_5511	UM THE WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND
Line_5512	UM THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5513	IT'S BASICALLY TURNING ON THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5514	IT PICKS UP THE WA THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5515	IT'S CLOSED
Line_5516	UM THE SWITCH WHEN WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST ACTIVATES THE ELECTRICITY AND PICKS UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5517	UM THE BATTERY IS MAKING ELECTRICITY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5518	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ALL THE WAY SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5519	IT'S THE IT IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WHICH PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5520	UM WELL BASICALLY IT'S UNTIL THE BATTERY LUN RUNS OUT OR THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF
Line_5521	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL IN A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_5522	UM I I'VE SEEN PAPER CLIPS BE MAGNETS YEAH
Line_5523	SEE YOU LATER BYE
Line_5524	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER NOT REALLY
Line_5525	UM A BATTERY UM A LIGHT BULB SOME WIRE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A HOLDER I GUESS
Line_5526	UM THE MAGNET THE WIRE THE LIGHT BULB AND HOLDER
Line_5527	UM THEY'RE UM BASICALLY THEY'RE SORT OF A MAGNET AND THEY'RE BATTERIES
Line_5528	UM THE WIRE MMM THE THE PART MAYBE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5529	A WIRE A LIGHT BULB UM A BATTERY A MOTOR UM A SWITCH AND THE UM BOARDS BASICALLY
Line_5530	UM IT'S A BATTERY AND IT HAS ONE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5531	UM IT'S ONE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT GENERATES MAGNETISM
Line_5532	UM IT'S A IT'S HA IT'S LIKE UM CIRCUIT WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5533	ELECTRICITY WHICH IS LIKE SORT OF MAGNETISM
Line_5534	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS AROUND
Line_5535	UM LIKE A PLACE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH LIKE A TUNNEL
Line_5536	UM IT'S
Line_5537	UM IT'S A RECEIVER AND THEN IT PROBABLY RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5538	UM THE ELECTRICITY COMES TO IT
Line_5539	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH IT AND IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5540	ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH A CIRCLE
Line_5541	THE ELECTRICITY'S TRAVELING IN A CIRCLE
Line_5542	UM IT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND THEN THE MOTOR GENERATES ELECTRICITY AND IT CHARGES THE MOTOR TO MOVE
Line_5543	IT TURNS THE ELECTRICITY ON AND OFF
Line_5544	UM THE ELECTRICITY MAKES A FULL CIRCLE THROUGH THEM
Line_5545	THE MOTOR THE BATTERY AND THE SWITCH
Line_5546	UM YOU PUT THE LEVER DOWN
Line_5547	IT LET'S THEM UM ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH PROPERLY
Line_5548	STUDYING BATTERIES AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5549	THEY'RE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5550	UM THERE'S A BATTERY A MOTOR A SWITCH A WIRE A LIGHT AND A BASE
Line_5551	UM THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5552	S THE BATTERY AND IT HAS ONE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S THE SOURCE
Line_5553	IT'S THE SOURCE OF UH ELECTRICITY
Line_5554	IT UM IS THE SOURCE FOR ELECTRICITY AND IT HELPS THE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH THE OBJECTS
Line_5555	IT'S THE MAIN BASE OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5556	IT'S THE PATHWAY OVER WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5557	UM THEY ARE THE PATHWAY OF WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5558	UM IT'S A CIRCLE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5559	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH A CIRCLE
Line_5560	ELECTRICITY'S TRAVELING THROUGH AND IT GOES PAST THE MOTOR AND IT AND IT CAUSES THE MOTOR TO SPIN
Line_5561	THEY THE ELECTRICITY COMES TO THEM
Line_5562	IT GOES IN A FULL CIRCLE WHEN THE SWITCH IS DOWN WHEN IT'S UP IT'S CUT OFF
Line_5563	IT UM IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL IN A CIRCUIT AND SPINS THE MOTOR
Line_5564	IT'S A SCHEMATIC AND IT SHOWS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE UM BATTERY
Line_5565	IT'S A IT SYMBOLS A LIGHT BULB ON A BATTERY
Line_5566	A SWITCH A BATTERY AND A MOTOR
Line_5567	WE HAVE BEEN UM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5568	IT HAS TOO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5569	THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP
Line_5570	WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH
Line_5571	THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS
Line_5572	WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM
Line_5573	IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THEN YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT
Line_5574	YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5575	YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FUN ESPECIALLY THE MESSY ONES
Line_5576	THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5577	UM THERE ARE TWO
Line_5578	BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BURN BRIGHTER
Line_5579	THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD
Line_5580	TODAY WE MADE ELECTROMAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK
Line_5581	TODAY WE MADE ELECTROMAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A DEAD BATTERY
Line_5582	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS SORT OF SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_5583	ONE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ANOTHER IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5584	UM IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_5585	UM IT HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5586	UM THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT
Line_5587	IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT OH THEN UM NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_5588	WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS A PROBABLY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN I CLICKED ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T BURN OUT
Line_5589	UM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH PRETTY MUCH CONNECTED TO THE UM D CELL
Line_5590	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF ONE BULB LIGHTS OUT BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHERS WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_5591	THEN UH THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT AS WELL AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_5592	UM WITH ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5593	UM IT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT
Line_5594	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING UM ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5595	WELL
Line_5596	IF YOU TURN IT IF YOU BY THE SWITCH THEN IT SORT OF TURNS THE ELECTROMAGNET ON SORT OF LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_5597	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT IN A S SORT OF IN A CIRCLE OR ELSE TH IT WON'T FLOW CORRECTLY
Line_5598	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5599	TEMPORARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG
Line_5600	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO UM NOT BE IT HAS TO RUN OUT FOR IT TO
Line_5601	WHEN IT IS CONNECTED UM NOT INCORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_5602	IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5603	I IT'S KIND OF LIKE A ROOT
Line_5604	IT'S THE UM ENERGY SOURCE THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRE TO CREATE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5605	I SEE A D CELL A LIGHT BULB UM REALLY SMALL LIGHT BULB AND SOME WIRE
Line_5606	THOSE ARE THE WIRES WHICH THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR START
Line_5607	UM WELL IT CHARGES THINGS
Line_5608	UM THE ENERGY IT COMES IN FROM ONE END AND GO UM COMES OUT IN THE OTHER
Line_5609	IT IS UM
Line_5610	IT IS UM CHARGING THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR GOES AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
Line_5611	IT SHOWS UM THE SYMBOLS
Line_5612	UM I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR
Line_5613	IF THEY WEREN'T N UM NEXT TO THE M FOR THE MOTOR OR THE D CELL SYMBOL THEN IT WOULDN'T RUN
Line_5614	UM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5615	WE JUST FINISHED UH LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY IN CLASS RIGHT N A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO
Line_5616	THEN THE ENERGY CAN'T FLOW THROUGH TO THE TO THE LIGHT BULB SO UM THE LIGHT BULB CANNOT LIGHT UP
Line_5617	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5618	WELL UM L LIKES UM REPEL AND OPPOSITES UM WAIT UM
Line_5619	THEY ARE
Line_5620	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_5621	UM WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL
Line_5622	WELL IF IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT BUT IT'S A IF IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WON'T BURN OUT
Line_5623	THAT THE WIRES UM AREN'T LIKE REALLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_5624	IF THERE IS ANOTHER LIGHT BULB OR UM THEY ALL BURN OUT
Line_5625	UH WELL UH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FASTER IN THE PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5626	WELL IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FAST IT'S FASTER THAN THE SERIOUS CIRCUIT
Line_5627	HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND MORE POWER
Line_5628	MORE POWER THAN THE SERIOUS CIRCUIT
Line_5629	BUT IT HAS MORE WIRES
Line_5630	PATHWAY AND FOR A PARALLEL IT'S TWO PATHWAYS WHICH IS GIVING IT MORE POWER
Line_5631	WE'VE UH BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5632	THEY'RE UM STUFF THAT ARE LI THAT USE ELECTRICITY
Line_5633	THAT IT'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5634	IT IT'S GIVING IT MORE POWER THE MAGNET MORE POWER
Line_5635	WHEN WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND A KIND OF UM MAGNET
Line_5636	YES AND
Line_5637	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5638	I HAVE TO GO MARNIE SEE YA
Line_5639	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5640	THEY'RE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY UH POWER TRAVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5641	THAT IT HAS POWER INSIDE IT
Line_5642	IT HAS A LOT OF ENERGY UH
Line_5643	UM THE BATTERY IS UM ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GIVING IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5644	IT'S GOING IN CIRCLES AND IT'S GIVING POWER TO THE MOTOR
Line_5645	WELL THE MOTOR HAS UH FOR IT TO BE RUNNING IT NEEDS ELECTRICITY
Line_5646	WELL BY CIRCUIT IS WHERE EVERYTHING GOES LIKE IN CIRCLES
Line_5647	UM WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING SO IT'S CLOSED
Line_5648	WELL UM IT CARRIES POWER
Line_5649	IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY RUN AND IT LETS THE MOTOR UM SPIN UH RUN
Line_5650	UM CLOSED CIRCUITS UM GO IN CIRCLES
Line_5651	IT'S OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY GOING MMM GIVING IT POWER
Line_5652	I SEE AN M AND UM SYMBOL
Line_5653	WHEN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB THERE NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER WIRE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WIRE IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5654	THEY'RE MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_5655	ENERGY IS FLOORING FLOWING THROUGH THEM
Line_5656	THE WIRE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UH WHERE THE OTHER WIRE IS HITTING
Line_5657	YOU NEED ENERGY TO FLOW IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5658	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5659	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5660	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY'RE SHARING THEY'RE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5661	TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK INSTEAD OF ONE LIGHT BULB WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5662	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AND COMING OUT THE SIDE
Line_5663	SORRY MARNIE I HAVE TO GO
Line_5664	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETS
Line_5665	AND SAME SIDES ATTRACT
Line_5666	THEY'RE UM REPELLING
Line_5667	THEY ARE UM THEY'RE REPELLING BEC SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5668	THEY HAVE SO MUCH FORCE SO THEY JUST THEY UM STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS MADE OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_5669	THE MAGNET IS PUTTING UM A LOT OF FORCE IN THE NAIL SO THAT PICKS UP THE PAPERCLIP
Line_5670	UM IT IS HANGING FROM THE PA IT THE PAPERCLIP IS HANG HANGING FROM THE NAIL
Line_5671	WE'VE BEEN LIGHTING LIGHT BULBS AND POWERING MOTORS
Line_5672	PARALLEL CIRCUIT WHEN LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM THE OTHER ONE KEEPS ON
Line_5673	WHEN A LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB STAYS
Line_5674	IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM UM ARE BRIGHTER
Line_5675	THERE ARE TWO UH WAYS
Line_5676	GOING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE D CELL TO THE TOP
Line_5677	THIS SHOWS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5678	WE'RE BURNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5679	TWO LIGHT BULBS A BATTERY
Line_5680	TOO MUCH POWER
Line_5681	THE POWER'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5682	AND IN ONE LOOK THE
Line_5683	IF I CLICK ON IT UM ONE TURNS ON AND ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5684	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5685	IF THERE'S A WIRE CONNECTING TO BOTH OF THEM THE WIRE GOES OUT TOO AND THEY BOTH GO THEY BOTH BURN
Line_5686	THERE'S A LOT UM
Line_5687	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5688	THE ELECTRICITY'S TRAVELING TO WIRE FROM THE D CELL AND GOING THROUGH THE UH LIGHT BULBS
Line_5689	THERE'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT'S ON THE RIGHT AND THE SERIES IS ON THE LEFT
Line_5690	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT NONE OF THE OTHERS DO
Line_5691	IF IF ONE LIGHT BULB UM BURNS OUT NONE OF THEM BURN OUT AND THEN IN A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT ALL OF THEM BURN OUT
Line_5692	IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE UM IT GOES BOTH WAYS AND IN A SERIES CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY ONLY TRAVELS ONE WAY
Line_5693	THERE IS TWO UM THERE'S TWO WAYS FOR IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY ONLY GOES ONE WAY THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_5695	IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5696	ELECTRICITY IN PARALLEL CIRCUIT TRAVELS BOTH WAYS AND ELECTRICITY IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT TRAVELS ONLY ONE WAY
Line_5697	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE AND IT THE OTHER ONES WON'T BURN OUT
Line_5698	A SERIES I MEAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5699	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5700	PUTTING A PAPER CLIP AROUND A BOX AND THEN IF IT STICK IF IT STICKS TO THE BOX THAT MEANS THERE'S THE MAGNET
Line_5701	WELL PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5702	WELL IT WAS KIND OF HARD TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE MAGNET WAS
Line_5703	IT'S LIKE MOVING AROUND
Line_5704	THEY SEPARATE
Line_5705	THE PAPER CLIPS STARTED TO SPIN AROUND ONCE IT GOT CLOSER TO THE MAGNET
Line_5706	THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLE ARE CONNECTING
Line_5707	IT'S STICKING TO THE BOX
Line_5708	KEPT UM LIKE STICKING ONCE IT ONCE WE GOT CLOSER IT KEPT PULLING ITSELF ALL THE WAY TO THE MAGNET
Line_5709	IT LIKE UM
Line_5710	STUCK TO THE BOX AND THEN IT DIDN'T FALL OFF SO WE KNEW THERE WAS A MAGNET THERE
Line_5711	IT STARTED A ATTRACTING ALL THE TO THE MAGNET
Line_5712	MOST OF THE IRON FILINGS ARE UM LINED UP AND SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE ALL MESSED UP
Line_5713	IT HAS METAL AND IRON IN IT SO THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_5714	THE NORTH KEPT UM MOVING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5715	THIS IS MADE FROM IRON SO UM IT MAKES IT STICK TO METAL
Line_5716	NOR THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT AND NORTH AND NORTH A OR SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_5717	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BATTERIES
Line_5718	THOSE ARE WIRES THAT CONNECT TO THE BATTERY TO MOVE THE ENGINE
Line_5719	WELL THE BATTERY IS UM
Line_5720	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH 'EM
Line_5721	THEY BRING THE ENERGY F FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR WHICH POWERS THE MOTOR
Line_5722	IN THE CIRCUIT THE ENERGY IS TRAVELING ROUND AND ROUND
Line_5723	THE CIRCUIT KINDS OF KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5724	IT KEEPS TURNING AROUND BECAUSE CIRCUIT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5725	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
Line_5726	UM IT'S GOING GREAT RIGHT NOW
Line_5727	IN SCIENCE RIGHT NOW I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5728	UM SO THE THING WITH THE PLUS AND THE MINUS IS IS A BATTERY
Line_5729	UM THE THE RED THING IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5730	THE GREEN STUFF IS WIRES
Line_5731	D CELL'S POWER UM OBJECTS
Line_5732	THE THE BATTERY PROVIDES UM AN ELECTRIC PATHWAY TO POWER IT A LIGHT BULB
Line_5733	IN SCIENCE I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND OTHER CIRCUITS
Line_5734	H I THINK ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5735	THE CIRCUIT I SEE THERE IS A PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5736	THE
Line_5737	THE BLUE DOTS ARE CARRYING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND POWERING IT
Line_5738	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5739	I AM SEEING TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5740	BECAUSE IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5741	WELL THE CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT HAS IS A PARALLEL PATHWAY AND THE CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS A SERIES
Line_5742	UM NO
Line_5743	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
Line_5744	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT UM UH MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_5745	WE'VE BEEN UM SEEING IF MAGNETS STICK ON STUFF
Line_5746	UH PAPER CLIPS AND UM
Line_5747	MAGNETS STICK TO LIKE STEEL MOSTLY STEEL
Line_5748	WELL THE MAGNET'S STICKING AND THEN THE MAGNET'S NOT STICKING TO THE TO THE SAME MAGNET FOR SOME REASON
Line_5749	THE MAGNET STUCK TO THE ONE CAUSE TH CAUSE THE TWO SIDES UM AND WELL
Line_5750	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE ONE BUT THEN THE OTHER WELL THERE'S ONE SIDE AND IF YOU FLIP THE MAGNET OVER THEN ONE OF THE SIDES WON'T STICK
Line_5751	WELL THE MAGNET'S UM I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE
Line_5752	I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
Line_5753	CAN'T THINK OF ANY UM
Line_5754	THERE WAS BOARDS THAT UM YOU LIKE PUT STUFF ON AND IT LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT ON YOUR DESK
Line_5755	UM YOU TRY TO P YOU PUT UM WIRES ON IT AND A MOTOR AND YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE UM WIRES ARE
Line_5756	THERE'S A WIRE CONNECTED UM TO D AND A
Line_5757	IT CONNECTS TO THESE UM I THINK THEY'RE BRASS THINGS OR THEY MIGHT BE STEEL
Line_5758	WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LITTLE GOLD THING ON TOP
Line_5759	IT'S A WIRE INSIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOAR
Line_5760	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH T TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH FOUR WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5761	WELL THE UM CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM I FORGOT WHAT A CIRCUIT WAS
Line_5762	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING BACK
Line_5763	THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY I THINK
Line_5764	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM UM THE UH D CELL I TH
Line_5765	THEY UM LIGHT BULBS L LIKE ARE BRIGHTER WHEN YOU WHEN THERE'S TWO BATTERIES BUT THEY'RE DIMMER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE
Line_5766	ES IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHTER
Line_5767	UM I DON'T KNOW UH BYE
Line_5768	I WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE TODAY SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5769	I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID CAUSE I WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE
Line_5770	UM I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING CAUSE I WASN'T HERE TODAY
Line_5771	I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5772	MAGNET AREN'T REALLY STICKING I THINK CAUSE THERE'S S SO MANY UH SPACERS
Line_5773	I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN'T OBSERVE ANYTHING UH WHAT
Line_5774	I DON'T I CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT I DON'T KNOW
Line_5775	WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5776	WELL UM THE UM THE D CELL BATTERY IS LIGHTING THE TWO UM UM LIGHT BULBS
Line_5777	THE ONE IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM BRIGHTER
Line_5778	THE BLUE DOTS IS THE UM ENERGY OR THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE THEN GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_5779	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5780	TWO SYMBOLS ON THE SIDE EQUAL LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE TWO SYMBOLS IN THE MIDDLE EQUAL A UM BATTERY
Line_5781	IT MEANS IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5782	IT'S GOING REALLY GOOD I MEAN PRETTY GOOD
Line_5783	I FORGOT WHAT I I FORGOT WHAT I WAS DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_5784	UM WELL IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE WAIT I FORGOT SORRY
Line_5785	WELL IF YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE D CELL AND THEN YOU TOUCH THE THE OTHER ENDS PF THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5786	WELL THE D CELL'S LIKE THE SOURCE OF UM UH I FORGOT
Line_5787	SEEMS LIKE THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5788	WELL IF YOU PUT LIKE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT UM OH I FORGOT
Line_5789	UH A CIRCUIT CAN IF YOU ATTACH WIRES TO THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB MUCH UM LIGHT LIKE LIGHT UP
Line_5790	THE UM WIRES ARE TAKING POWER FROM THE UM D CELL PRETTY MUCH AND THEN IT'S GIVING THE POWER TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5791	I THINK IT MIGHT BE LIKE ELECTRICITY BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5792	IT IT'S WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UM TO THE D CELL AND YEAH
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB ELSE IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_5794	WELL ONE NEEDS TO TOUCH ON THE BOTTOM ONE NEEDS TO TOUCH ON THE SIDE ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WON'T TURN ON
Line_5795	WE OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_5796	I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS MAY BE A ER I DON'T KNOW
Line_5797	WELL WE WERE LIKE DOING THIS THING WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_5798	WELL WE USED TO A WIRE A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR AND A LITTLE PLATFORM AND THEN A SWITCH
Line_5799	WELL THE D CELL KIND OF IS LIKE THE IS THE ELECTRIC SOURCE PRETTY MUCH
Line_5800	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE
Line_5801	IT PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY PRETTY MUCH
Line_5802	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5803	I THINK IT'S LIKE IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY OR OR ELECTRICITY PRETTY MUCH I THINK
Line_5804	WELL IT'S SPINNING CAUSE THE D CELL'S GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE MOTOR
Line_5805	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL THE METAL'S TOUCHING THE WIRE PRETTY MUCH SO YEAH
Line_5806	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5807	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IS SPINNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_5808	WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE MOTOR
Line_5809	BOTTOM IT'S PRETTY IT'S A LIGHT BULB I MEAN A A D CELL BATTERY OR A BATTERY ON THE TOP IT'S A LIGHT BULB
Line_5810	WHICH I THINK I THINK THERE'S LIKE A SWITCH
Line_5811	WELL I TOOK THE ELECTROMAGNET IS PICKING UP A A WHOLE BUNCH OF MAGNETS
Line_5812	THE LESS WRAPS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5813	IT GETS STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5814	IT GETS MORE MAGNET UM IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5815	IT PICKS UP MORE WA UM WASHERS
Line_5816	WELL UM THE STRENGTH IS GETTING WELL UM IT GETS STRONGER
Line_5817	YOU CAN WRAP A WIRE AROUND IT
Line_5818	CAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
Line_5819	UM THAT IT GETS STRONGER EVERYTIME THERE'S MORE WIRES
Line_5820	IT'LL BE LIKE TWENTY I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT
Line_5821	WELL I WENT TO WHERE THE NINETY FIVE WOULD BE ON THE GRAPH AND THEN I WENT OVER AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT'D BE ON FIFTEEN
Line_5822	ERS ARE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS I THINK
Line_5823	WELL SINCE THE PAPER CLIP'S STEEL IT'S PRETTY IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_5824	MOST OF 'EM ARE MADE FROM STEEL SOME OF 'EM ARE ALUMINUM THOUGH
Line_5825	STEEL AND ALUMINUM
Line_5826	THEY'RE ALL NOT STEEL OR ALUMINUM
Line_5827	INSULATORS ARE LIKE UM SPONGES ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5828	INSULATORS ARE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT STEEL
Line_5829	WELL ONLY ST WELL STEEL UM CAN GET PICKED UP BY A MAGNET BUT ALUMINUM IT CAN'T
Line_5830	THEY'RE ALL STEEL
Line_5831	HI MARNIE MY NAME IS NICOLINE HOW ARE YOU DOING DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DAY IS
Line_5832	WE'VE BEEN UM TESTING MAGNETS ON DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY STICK OR NOT
Line_5833	THEY AL UM THEY'RE ALL EITHER STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CONTAINS IRON OR IRON
Line_5834	ONE NAIL IS NOT IRON OR STEEL
Line_5835	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO UM IRON OR STEEL UM ONE OF THEM WASN'T MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT DIDN'T STICK
Line_5836	THE MAGNETIC FORCE UM CAN KIND OF GENERATE AROUND LIKE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO STICK TO OTHER THINGS
Line_5837	THEY CAN GO THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE 'EM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5838	ONE OF THE MAGNETS IS GENERATING UM MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE TABLE SO IT'S MAKING IT STICK
Line_5839	I'M NOT SURE HOW IT DOES IT BUT MAGNETS CAN JUST SOMEHOW GENERATE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE ANOTHER MAGNET STICK
Line_5840	UM UH THE THICKNESS REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO THICK THEN MAGNETIC FORCE WON'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_5841	UM THAT ALL THE MAGNETIC DOMAINS INSIDE ARE ALL FACING THE SAME WAY AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH INTO M TURNED INTO IT'S PRETTY MUCH TURNED INTO A MAGNET
Line_5842	THE UH MAGNET HAD CHARGED THE NAIL UM TO MAKE IT BE A MAGNET S AND UM
Line_5843	THE MAGNET HADN'T BEEN RUBBED TO CHARGE THE NAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO IT DIDN'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5844	BECAUSE THE UM MAGNET CHARGES THE NAIL PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT UM SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5845	UH A CIRCUIT IS A WAY FOR UM ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL AND IT MAKES SOME KIND OF CIRCLE FORM
Line_5846	UM ELECTRICITY A CIRCUIT IS A WAY TO LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL
Line_5847	IT'S FORMING A CIRCLE
Line_5848	IT HAS TO GO FROM THE MINUS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5849	ONE HAS UM MORE THINGS IN IT THE OTHER ONE JUST IS A BASIC LIGHT BULB CIRCUIT
Line_5850	THE WIRE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS JUST BASIC
Line_5851	IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UP INTO T THE LIGHT BULB DOWN AND THEN UP INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN DOWN AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5852	IT SHOWS LIKE WHERE HOW THEY ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_5853	INTO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_5854	IT GOES AROUND INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UM OUT OF THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND IT JUST KEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5855	I'VE ALREADY SAID ENOUGH ABOUT FLOW
Line_5856	UM THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE BRINGS IT IN
Line_5857	NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU TURN IT UM THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALWAYS GONNA PUT THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE PLUS SIDE IS ALWAYS GONNA BRING IT IN
Line_5858	UM THE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE STILL GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5859	THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM YOU SEE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS COMING OUT OF
Line_5860	I'M STUDYING INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A WIRE IT'S JUST GOING INTO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEN OUT AGAIN
Line_5861	TWO BATTERIES HAS MORE POWER THAN ONE SO THE LIGHT BULBS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
Line_5862	I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME SO BYE
Line_5863	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH UM THE CUP SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5864	THE BREAKS A MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEN THE WAVE FROM THE WASHERS
Line_5865	IT'S MOVING THE MAG IT'S MOVING THE MAGNETS FARTHER APART
Line_5866	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP SO THEY CAN STICK BUT UM IT'S BUT MA MAGNETIC FORCE IS DECREASING WHEN THE SPACERS ARE PUT BETWEEN THEM
Line_5867	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS EITHER HAVE LIKE A MAGNET UM MAGNETS TOGETHER AND WASHERS
Line_5868	MAY BE GROUP C USED DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WEREN'T AS STRONG
Line_5869	WE WERE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY AND WE TALKED A LITTLE ABO OU A LITTLE BIT ANIMALS THAT USE ELECTRICITY TO FIND FOOD AND KEEP A PREDATORS AWAY
Line_5870	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE UM BOTH PARALLEL TO ARE KINDA PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER
Line_5871	NO MATTER WHICH WAY THE BATTERY IS TURNED UM IT'LL ELECTRICITY WILL ALWAYS GO OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ALWAYS GO IN F UM TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5872	THE FLOW IS GOING UP BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AROUND AND THEN THE FLOW WILL BE GOING DOWN
Line_5873	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES E THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5874	THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5875	TH THE MINUS SIDE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY OUT THEN IT'S GOING UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5876	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS TWO FOR EACH
Line_5877	EVERYWHERE ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDER IT'S GREEN SO ELECTRICITY FLOWS ALL THROUGH IT
Line_5878	THE CIRCLE WITH THE LOOPS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LITTLE THE PLAIN C UM LINES ARE
Line_5879	EVERYTHING IN IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN A CIRCUIT
Line_5880	IT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE'S TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5881	WE MADE ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5882	WELL SINCE IT'S A ELECTROMAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO UM PICK MAGNETIC THINGS UP
Line_5883	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AROUND OR ELSE IT WON'T REALLY WORK
Line_5884	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5885	THAT THE ELECTRICITIER IS COMPLETELY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_5886	UM IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN IT IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_5887	IT HAS TO BE IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE MAGNET TO WORK
Line_5888	UM IT THE WASHERS WILL START STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_5889	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE RIVET TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5890	IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
Line_5891	THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK AND IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_5892	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH UM PROPERLY BUT IF IT'S NOT UM THEN THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5893	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5894	UM A TEMPORARY MAGNET DOESN'T MEANS IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER SO UM SOME ELECTROMAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS A MAGNET
Line_5895	UM SOME MAG THAT SOME MAGNETS NEED UM ELECTRICITY TO WORK CAUSE THEY'RE ONLY ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5896	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND MAKE AND LET THE R
Line_5897	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5898	THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY TYPE THAT WORKS AS A NORMAL MAGNET THAT WILL STICK TO LIKE A NORMAL MAGNET
Line_5899	IT KIND OF PUTS THE OUT THE ENERGY OUT INTO THE WIRES SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE SOURCE OF IT
Line_5900	UM THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE UM OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5901	THEY LET THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT SO IT CAN LIKE GO TO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT IT TO GO TO
Line_5902	THEY LET THE UM ELECTRICITY KIND OF FLOW THROUGH SO THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THE PATH A LITTLE PATHWAY
Line_5903	IT'S KIND OF WHAT THE UM ELECTRICITY GOES TO CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT NEEDS ELECTRICITY SO
Line_5904	UM RECEIVER MEANS THAT YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5905	IT USES THE ELECTRICITY TO START RUNNING
Line_5906	IT'S RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S RUNNING
Line_5907	ONCE THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING METAL UM IT THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_5908	IT'S TOUCHING METAL AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5909	IT'S TOUCHING M THE METAL
Line_5910	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5911	MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCLE
Line_5912	IT'S GOING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE MOTOR OUT OF THE MOTOR AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_5913	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EITHER LIKE TOUCHING A BATTERY OR METAL
Line_5914	THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES FLOWING TO THE LITTLE CIRCLE WITH THE THING IN IT
Line_5915	THE CIRCLE WITH THE LOOP IN IT IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5916	A BATTERY ONE SIDE IS THE PLUS SIDE ONE LINE IS THE PLUS SIDE THE OTHER SIDE IS THE MI MINUS SIDE
Line_5917	THERE'S A BATTERY A MOTOR AND TWO WIRES
Line_5918	IT'S A MOTOR UM THE M IS PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE THE MOTOR STARTS WITH M
Line_5919	THE LITTLE LINE IS A DOT ON THE END IS A SWITCH
Line_5920	IT SHOWS YOU A WAY TO SET UP THE CIRCUIT
Line_5921	THEY'RE UM MAGNETS USE ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS MAGNETS
Line_5922	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5923	IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTROMAGNET TO WORK
Line_5924	A CLOSED CIRCUIT LET'S ELECTRICITY FLOW BUT AN OPEN CIRCUIT DOESN'T
Line_5925	THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT ON THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS
Line_5926	IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED WINDS IT'S SUPER STRONG SO IT CAN PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIKE FIVE IT COULD ONLY PICK UP LIKE TWO OR THREE
Line_5927	IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT MAKES THE MAG THE ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
Line_5928	THE MORE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIVET THE STRONGER IT IS
Line_5929	THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UM STUFF
Line_5930	UM HOW MUCH CHARGE THE BATTERY HAS AND HOW HOW IF IN THE SWITCH
Line_5931	MORE WINDS GIVES IT MORE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS SO IF IT HAS MORE WINDS IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS
Line_5932	UM YOU CAN WIND IT MORE
Line_5933	THE MORE WINDS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP
Line_5934	IT GETS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN GET
Line_5935	PROBABLY IN A BAR GRAPH LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TEN WINDS THREE WASHERS TWENTY WINDS FIVE WASHERS AND IT KEEPS GOING UP
Line_5936	THE NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP
Line_5937	THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE STRONGER THE MAGNET GETS
Line_5938	IF IT DOESN'T PICK UP VERY MANY THEN IT D THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY WRAPS BUT IF IT PICKS UP A LOT THEN IT HAS A LOT OF WRAPS
Line_5939	WELL NINETY GOT FIFTEEN AND HALF OF TEN IS FIVE AND TEN ONLY GOT THREE
Line_5940	THERE'S A BUNCH OF OBJECTS ON THE LEFT AND THEN THERE'S A SWITCH A MOTOR AND TWO WIRES AND UM YOU'RE GONNA TOUCH THE TH TO YOU'RE GONNA ATTACH THE
Line_5941	CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEM CAUSE THEY CONDUCT IT KIND OF
Line_5942	THE CONDUCTORS WERE PRETTY MUCH ALL METAL THINGS AND THEY LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_5943	WHAT'S EVER IN THE CIRCUIT LIKE THE LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR WILL TURN ON
Line_5944	YOU BY THE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF TOUCHING THE SWITCH TO METAL UM YOU PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL ON IT AND TO BY IT
Line_5945	IT CAN G LIKE BY A CIRCUIT AND LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH
Line_5946	INSULATORS DON'T UM LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THERE DON'T BY THE CIRCUIT SO NOTHING WILL TURN ON
Line_5947	CONDUCTORS LET THE UM CIRCUIT TURN ON BUT INSULATORS DON'T
Line_5948	THE MOTOR STANDS STILL BECAUSE UM INSULATORS ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE OF METAL
Line_5949	INSULATORS ARE NOT REALLY MADE OF METAL STRAWS WOOD ROCKS AND LIKE SPONGES NONE OF THEM ARE MADE OF METAL
Line_5950	THEY DON'T BY THE CIRCUIT SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON
Line_5951	THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF CONDUCTORS UM THEY CAN'T BY THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL USUALLY
Line_5952	IRON AND STEEL WHICH ARE BOTH METAL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5953	THEY'RE BOTH EITHER IRON OR STEEL
Line_5954	HI MY NAME IS KEITH AND I'M AWESOME
Line_5955	UM MAGNET IT'S A MAGNET MAGNET ATTRACTS IRON
Line_5956	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASSROOM WE WERE UM WE'RE DOING MAGNETISM AND UM OUR TEACHER SAID THAT
Line_5957	THEY REPEL AND ATTRACT
Line_5958	WELL THE N AND THE N BOUNCE OFF AND THE N AND THE S COME TOGETHER AND THE S AND THE N COME TOGETHER BUT THE S AND THE S BOUNCE OFF
Line_5959	OKAY I'M DONE
Line_5960	WELL THEY HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE BRADS AND THE BRADS HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER WIRE UNDER UNDER UM UNDER THE BOARD
Line_5961	THEY'RE RE THEY'RE CALLED BRADS OR COMPONENTS OR I MEAN CONDUCTORS
Line_5962	IF YOU IF THE BRADS WEREN'T METAL THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT IT WO IT WOULD JUST IT WOULDN'T JUST GO THROUGH IT AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T
Line_5963	UH WELL THE WIRE UNDERNEATH THE BRADS UH MAKES THE IT MAKES IT A WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_5964	BECAUSE THE IRON BECAUSE THE IRON IN THEM UM ATTRACTS TO EACH OTHER
Line_5965	IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPEL AND THEY'RE ATTRACT
Line_5966	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS THAT MAGNETS ARE REALLY STRONG AND THEY CAN GO THROUGH REALLY THICK UM THINGS
Line_5967	WELL IF IT GOES THROUGH THINGS THAT MEANS THE MAGNET'S REALLY STRONG
Line_5968	UM A TABLE UM UH UM A WASHER
Line_5969	WELL THE THICKNESS IS LIKE
Line_5970	L WHERE ALL THE MAGNETIC UM WHERE THE MAGNET IS MAKING UM THE NAIL
Line_5971	IT SHOWS ME THAT THIS MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE UM NAIL SO THAT IT WILL ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5972	YOU HAVE UM TO SLIDE THE MAGNET ACROSS THE UM NAIL SO IT IT WILL MAKE A MAGNETIC FIELD TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5973	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT OKAY I DON'T KNOW OH WAIT
Line_5974	WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE IT HAS WIRES AND IT ON THE IT WELL IT MAKES IT THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE
Line_5975	ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE W
Line_5976	UM BECAUSE ONE THERE'S ONLY THE ONE THE LIGHT BULB UM AND EL TWO WIRES IN THE OTHER THERE'S THREE WIRES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5977	IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5978	WELL IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND FLOWS OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5979	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE A
Line_5980	WELL I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_5981	WELL IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T UM BE LIT AS MUCH
Line_5982	WELL IF THERE IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T BE AS LIT
Line_5983	WELL THE ENERGY UM UH FLOWS THROUGH UM BOTH BATTERIES AND GETS MORE POWER TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS MORE
Line_5984	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIT MORE AND W THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY WOULD UM BE LIT LESS
Line_5985	UM THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES IS LIT UM MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS A LOT MORE BRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS UM DIM
Line_5986	IF YOU DIDN'T ADD MORE UM ANOTHER BATTERY OR MORE POWER THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE STILL BE DIM
Line_5987	UM THE ENERGY UM IS MORE PA IS MORE POWERED AN AND MAKES THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT MORE
Line_5988	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IT'S WAIT
Line_5989	OH WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO THE SERIES CIRCUIT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT MORE
Line_5990	WELL HERE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES AND WIRES CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_5991	UM WE WERE STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5992	THERE'S TWO PA UM PATHWAYS ON THIS PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT AND THERE'S ONLY ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_5993	UM I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER IT
Line_5994	WELL THE BLUE DOTS IS THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING REAL FAST THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5995	INTO THE BATTERY AT THE UM POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GETTING RECHARGED AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDES AND POWERING THE LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
Line_5996	UM THERE'S TWO UM LIGHT BULBS BOTH POWERED A LOT INTO FOUR UM WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5997	RE'S UM IT'S SHOWING TWO LIGHT BULBS FOUR WIRES AND UM A BATTERY OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5998	THE MIDDLE SYMBOL UM REPRESENTS A BATTERY
Line_5999	REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6000	THERE WAS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM THAT'S LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6001	MEANS THAT THE UM WIRES ARE NEVER TOUCHING AND THEY'RE JUST GOING UM ON AND THEY NEVER TOUCH
Line_6002	IT TELLS ME THAT THE THAT THE BATTERY CHARGES BOTH LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6003	THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
Line_6004	WE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_6005	THAT MEANS IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO ELECTRICITY WILL TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_6006	UM WELL IT'S IMPORTANT WAIT WHAT
Line_6007	ICH IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT CAN TURN OFF THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OR ON THE HER CIRCUIT
Line_6008	S
Line_6009	UM WHAT
Line_6010	E IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT UM AND I WAS PUTTING IT AGAINST THE WASHERS THEY E IT WASN'T PICKING UP ANY WASHERS
Line_6011	EN WELL THE R THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET SO THAT THE RIVET CAN UM PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6012	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM LIKE STEEL OR IRON
Line_6013	WE WHEN UM WE WRAPPED IT AROUND FIVE AND THEN TEN TIMES AND THEN FIFTEEN AND THEN TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN THIRTY
Line_6014	IF YOU IT SHOWS THAT THAT IF YOU YOU WRAPPED IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MEANS IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6015	MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM THAT YOU WRAPPED THE WIRE UM A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET
Line_6016	WELL IT'S IT GETS MORE STRENGTH BY IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND IF YOU WRAP IF YOU WRAP THE WIRES AROUND IT MORE
Line_6017	IF IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS THAT MEANS IT'S THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET IS STRONGER
Line_6018	BY WRAPPING UM THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET LIKE MORE
Line_6019	WELL THE MORE YOU WIND IT AROUND THE UM THE MORE YOU WIND THE WIRES AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6020	M IF IF YOU KEEP UM WRAPPING IT AROUND MORE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6021	IT'S STRONGER THAN A WASHER THAT PICKS UP A FEW WASH UM MA WASHERS
Line_6022	IT GETS STRONGER BECAUSE UM MORE ELECTRICITY'S GOING AROUND IT SO IT GETS STRONGER AND UM IT CAN PICK UP MORE
Line_6023	WELL IT SHOWS THAT WHEN I INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WRAPS THE MORE WASHERS I GET SO
Line_6024	M RA
Line_6025	UM WELL THE NUMBER OF WRAPS GET HIGHER TO LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FOR FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY HUNDRED
Line_6026	NUMBER LA WRAPS GETS LARGER THE UM THE HIGHER THE LITTLE GREEN DOTS GO AND THE HIGHER THEY GO UM THE GREEN LINE GO
Line_6027	THE WASHERS ARE UM GETTING SO THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE WASHERS THE MORE WRAPS
Line_6028	WELL INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT K UM THAT IF YOU PUT ATTACH THEM TO THE WIRES THE ECLECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH 'EM AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6029	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH THE UM ROCK OR THE SPONGE AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6030	IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR ATTACHED TO THE WIRE THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING
Line_6031	WELL THE STRAW IS MADE OF PLASTIC SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_6032	THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS AND THEY ALL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6033	M STEEL METAL ALUMINUM ANYTHING THAT CAN STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_6034	WELL METAL HAS IRON IN IT AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IRON IN CERTAIN THINGS TO STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6035	YES MARNIE YOU DID REPEAT YOURSELF AND YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB
Line_6036	I'VE BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME
Line_6037	SOME OF THEM WILL STICK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM WON'T
Line_6038	VERY WELL I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_6039	WELL THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BOARDS AND THEY HAVE BRADS AND THEY HAVE A WIRE THROUGH THERE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WIRE IS SO YOU HAVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_6040	WELL IF THERE WAS NO WIRE BEHIND THE BOARD THEN THE LIGHT BULB OR THE MOTOR WOULD NEVER LIGHT UP
Line_6041	WELL THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE RUNNING FROM EACH END OF THE BRAD
Line_6042	WELL THEY'RE EASY TO PUT YOUR WIRE TO AND THEY'RE METAL
Line_6043	WELL METAL WELL ELECTRICITY CAN RUN THROUGH METAL IN THIS CASE IT IS METAL AND UM SO IT JUST THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BRAD AND YEAH
Line_6044	WELL BEHIND EACH BRAD THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED
Line_6045	IT TELLS ME THAT BEHIND A AND B BRADS ARE CONNECTED TO A SMALL WIRE THAT COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT
Line_6046	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HANG ON
Line_6047	I THINK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET UM I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S THE FORCE JUST BECAUSE I GUESS
Line_6048	WELL I SORT OF DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS IS DOING
Line_6049	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6050	WELL YOU SORT OF HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO RUB IT ON TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_6051	THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6052	OKAY SO WAIT HANG ON
Line_6053	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND UM TRYING TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT BULBS YEP
Line_6054	WELL THE ELECTRICITY GOES SORT OF ON A PATHWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6055	WELL ONE OF THEM IS POWERING TWO BATTERIES I MEAN TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6056	WELL THIS WOULD HAVE TO SHARE THE ELECTRICITY SO ONE OF THEM SO THEY BOTH GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER SO THEY CAN BOTH GET LIGHT UP
Line_6057	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_6058	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6059	WELL THE BLUE DOTS SORT OF SHOW ELECTRICITY I GUESS
Line_6060	WELL OF COURSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO T FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_6061	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH BOTH BATTERY I MEAN THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
Line_6062	WELL THE IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6063	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT AND INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_6064	WELL THE ELECTRICITY F FLOWS FROM THE UM FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_6065	UM THE AND THE UM ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_6066	IT REVERSES THE DIRECTION OF THE WAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6067	WELL IT WORKS BOTH WAYS IT JUST REVERSES THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6068	WELL FLOWS THE WAY IT'S LIKE A PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_6069	WELL IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP A LOT MORE
Line_6070	WELL IT DEFINITELY DOES LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB A LOT MORE
Line_6071	THERE'S MORE UM ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY WHICH MEANS IT FLOWS FASTER
Line_6072	THEY LIT UP THEY W THEY LIT UP UM A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_6073	THEY GET A LOT BOTH LIGHT BULBS GET A LOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN BATTERY SO THEY EACH GET POWER THE SAME
Line_6074	WELL WHEN THEY ARE TWO BATTERIES THEY BO THEY LIGHT UP A LOT BRIGHTER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS MUCH
Line_6075	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING AND IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_6076	MARNIE I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_6077	WELL UM THEY GET FASTER
Line_6078	THEY GET UM THE ELECTRICITY GETS FASTER
Line_6079	VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_6080	UM THE FORCE GETS WEAKER
Line_6081	THE FORCE IS UM STRONGER
Line_6082	WELL WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE PUT WASHERS INTO CUP A
Line_6083	UM BETWEEN UM THE WASHER I MEAN THE MAGNET AND THE CUP AND THE MAGNET UM ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THERE ARE UM LIKE
Line_6084	UM HAVING SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNET UM WEAKENS THE FORCE YOU KNOW OF THE MAGNETS
Line_6085	THE DISTANCE GETS THEY'RE FARTHER APART WHICH MEANS IT WEAKENS THEIR FORCE
Line_6086	DON'T YOU MEAN A B AND D
Line_6087	A B AND D GOT THE SAME UM AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE THEY DID THE SAME PROCEDURES BUT GROUP C DIDN'T
Line_6088	OH WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6089	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_6090	WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T SAY THAT
Line_6091	IT IS WRAPPED VERY NEATLY
Line_6092	IT'S CALLED A STEEL RIVET
Line_6093	UM SO SO THE WIRE CAN TH FLOW THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_6094	WELL THERE ARE WASHERS DOWN THERE AND IT SORT OF AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6095	WELL YOU NEED TO THINK WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PART IF THERE'S NO ONE PART THEN THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK
Line_6096	WELL YOU NEED TO WRAP IT AROUND THE THE RIVET VERY VERY LIKE PRECISE
Line_6097	THE WASHERS COME UP AND UM LIKE UM CONNECT TO THE RIVET
Line_6098	ALRIGHT NOW LET'S UM PLAY CLOSED
Line_6099	WELL A IT JUST IT WHATEVER THE ELECTROMAGIC HAD PICKED UP IT DROPS
Line_6100	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN THE WASHERS GO UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6101	THEN THE WASHERS GO BACK UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6102	WELL WITHOUT THE ELECTRICITY THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD JUST BE A PLAIN RIVET BUT YOU NEED THE ELECTRICITY F TO GO INTO THE RIVET AND PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_6103	UM WELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANY ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THEN IT WILL NEVER WORK AND YEAH
Line_6104	UM THE RIVET OR CORE HAS BEEN MADE FROM IRON TO BE A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6105	WELL THAT Y IT JUST NEEDS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND SOMETHING MADE OF IRON TO BE A TEMPORARY MAGNET YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND SOMETHING LIKE LET'S SAY YOU MADE A PLASTIC NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
Line_6106	VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6107	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_6108	YOU NEED A SWITCH A MOTOR A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_6109	THE BATTERY IS THE SOURCE AND THE SOURCE GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO UM TO TO SEND THE ELECTRICITY DOWN TO WHATEVER IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO
Line_6110	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE PO FROM THE NEGATIVE END OF THE D CELL BACK TO THE POSITIVE
Line_6111	WELL A MOTOR IS A MOTOR COULD BE THE RECEIVER IT COULD BE UM THE MOTOR COULD BE A RECEIVER IT IS THE RECEIVER
Line_6112	A RECEIVER HAS SOMETHING THAT A RECEIVER IS THE THING THAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6113	MARNIE I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6114	THE MOTOR IS UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_6115	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVERY WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED
Line_6116	THE SYMBOLS UM THE LINE WITH THE LONGER LINE THE SHORT LINE AND THE LONG LINE REPRESENTS THE BATTERY AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE LITTLE LOOP IN THE MIDDLE IS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6117	THE M IS FOR THE MOTOR
Line_6118	WE MAKE AN UM O UM A AN O A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6119	ISN'T A WASHER A CONDUCTOR TOO
Line_6120	INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND THEY BLOCK ELECTRICITY FROM COMING THROUGH
Line_6121	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY TH FLOW THROUGH THEM AND CONDUCTORS DO
Line_6122	WELL ONLY METAL ONES WORK ONLY
Line_6123	UM I WAS TALKING
Line_6124	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR I MEAN OPEN WHEN YOU ADD A INSULATOR
Line_6125	IT'S CLOSED
Line_6126	WELL YOU CAN MAKE METAL INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6127	IS IT UM IT HAS TO BE UM LIKE STEEL
Line_6128	THEY ALL HAVE TO BE UM STEEL METAL
Line_6129	I HAVE IT TO WORK
Line_6130	YES I DO GET THAT MARNIE
Line_6131	YES I'M READY
Line_6132	WELL WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE SUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6133	W UM WE HAVE OBSERVED HOW IT CONNECTS TO THINGS AND HOW IT CAN STICK TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC
Line_6134	UM CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_6135	THEY CONNECT TO THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND THAT HAVE IRON IN THEM MOST OF THE TIME
Line_6136	I SEE THAT THE TWO MAGNETS ON THE TOP WA CONNECTED TOGETHER WHEN I PUSHED 'EM TOGETHER BUT THE BOTTOM ONES WHEN I THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ALUMINUM AND HAD NO STEEL IN THEM AND THEY HAD NO IRON BECAUSE WHEN I CLICKED THEM TOGETHER ALL THEY DID WAS PUSH AWAY
Line_6137	TOP ONE WAS CONNECTING TOGETHER BECAUSE IT HAD IRON IN 'EM IRON IN IT BUT
Line_6138	THEY ARE CLICKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_6139	PUSHED AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALUMINUM AND NOT IRON LIKE THE OTHER ONES
Line_6140	THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN THEM BUT THEN THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ALUMINUM
Line_6141	BYE NICE MEETING YOU BYE BYE
Line_6142	YOU DON'T WANNA GET BURNED
Line_6143	THEY'RE MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_6144	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT ELECTRICITY FLEWS MA FLOWS THROUGH METAL
Line_6145	WHAT HAPPENS HAS TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE TO GET A SWITCH
Line_6146	IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IF IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IT MAKES ELECTRICITY AND YES
Line_6147	BYE WE NEED TO GO BYE
Line_6148	HELLO
Line_6149	JUST HOLD ON JUST ONE MINUTE
Line_6150	OH WAIT I'M SORRY WHEN YOU C TAKE THE UM UM DOUGHNUT HOLE THING OFF THEN THE NAIL AND YOU STILL HOLD THE NAIL THEN THE PAPER CLIP WILL FALL OFF BECAUSE IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY MAGNET TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6151	WHEN THE MAGNET IS IS ON THE NAIL IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE MAGNET IT LET GOES
Line_6152	THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6153	THE MAGNET WAS OVERDOING IT MAGNET MAGNET FIELD VIEW AND THEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT THE MAGNET FLEW AWAY UM SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET AWAY FROM SOMETHING LIKE THE MAGNET WAS OVER HERE AND THEN WHEN THE MAGNET LEFT YOU COULD TELL THAT
Line_6154	WAIT SO WHAT
Line_6155	WE'VE BEEN DOING PATHWAYS AND ELECTRICITY AND STUFF
Line_6156	UM IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT FLOWS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6157	A CIRCUIT IS WHERE IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND HAS PAPER IN IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6158	UM THE ENERGY'S FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6159	IT CIRCLES AROUND THE THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WORKS
Line_6160	THE BATTERY HAS TO BE POSITIVE TO
Line_6161	UM WELL THERE'S ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_6162	THEY COMPARE BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP
Line_6163	UM ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WHICH BUT THEN THEY'RE THEY'RE POINTING THE SAME WAY SO THAT'S CAUSING IT TO NOT WORK
Line_6164	IT'S DIMMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FULL FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6165	IT IT DOES COMPARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE ONE'S DIM AND ONE'S FULLY LIT UP
Line_6166	WELL THE BLUE DOTS KEEP GOING AND GOING UNTIL THEY STOP WHEN YOU DISCONNECT THE WIRES
Line_6167	WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6168	TO NEGATIVE
Line_6169	UM IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SO THAT IT SHOWS ME THAT THERE THERE IS A FLOW BUT IF THERE'S NOT A FLOW THEN THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_6170	WHEN YOU SWITCH IT IT GOES ONE DIRECTION BUT THEN WHEN YOU S SWITCH IT LIKE THAT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_6171	IT ALWAYS FLOWS UH POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6172	IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE POSITIVE
Line_6173	IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH
Line_6174	IT WORKS LIKE IT DID BEFORE BUT JUST A LITTLE MORE POWER
Line_6175	I NOTICED THAT THEY WERE BOTH FLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_6176	THAT ACTUALLY ONE D CELL CAN BE
Line_6177	THEY'RE LINED UP THE SAME BUT THEY'RE JUST BUT THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST FLOWING THE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
Line_6178	WELL IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6179	IT MAKES IT HAVE MORE POWER AND LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6180	UM IT LIGHTS UP MORE BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY
Line_6181	IT'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6182	UM ELECTRICITY MOSTLY
Line_6183	I FIGURED OUT THAT UM
Line_6184	IT REPRESENTS TWO BATTERIES AND TWO
Line_6185	HMM I KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO OFF
Line_6186	WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM
Line_6187	THAT THERE WAS NINETEEN WASHERS
Line_6188	THERE WAIT WHAT IS THIS
Line_6189	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE MAGNETS HAVE ENOUGH FORCE TO GET THROUGH ONE SPACER SO IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP B AND IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP A
Line_6190	THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACERS THAT IT TOOK THAT THE FORCE COULDN'T STAY TOGETHER AND IT THEY WOULDN'T STICK SO
Line_6191	S FIVE SPACERS NEEDED THREE THREE WASHERS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS ENOUGH
Line_6192	THEY ARE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_6193	TO JUST FOLLOW THE RULES AND LOOK OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THAT'S WHAT THEY KIND OF DO I GUESS
Line_6194	A B AND D GOT NINETEEN WASHERS AND THAT WAS ENOUGH AND THE OTHER PICTURES THAT YOU SHOWED ME TO DISCONNECT IT AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FORCE
Line_6195	TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS IN A NINETEEN WASHERS IN B AND THEN GROUP D TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS AND THEN IN GROUP C FIVE
Line_6196	SPACERS AND THEN THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
Line_6197	A NINETEEN B NINETEEN C FIVE D NINETEEN
Line_6198	IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE RIVET CAN PICK UP
Line_6199	UM YOU MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE OF THE THE RIVET KIND OF HAS MOST OF THE ENERGY
Line_6200	IT MEANS THAT THERE IS MAGNETISM IN IT AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN IT
Line_6201	PROBABLY A WASHER WILL MAKE IT WORK BUT IT SOMETIMES WON'T
Line_6202	I'M SORRY WHAT
Line_6203	UM WELL IT JUST KIND OF CONNECTS BECAUSE OF THE FLOW OF IT PROBABLY
Line_6204	THE FLOW IS THE M BASICALLY WHAT IT JUST IS DOING IF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OR IF IT IS NOT
Line_6205	IT'S THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S CLOSED THERE'S A LOT OF ELECTRICITY STILL FLOWING
Line_6206	IT HAS TO BE UM CLOSED FOR IT TO ATTRACT IT
Line_6207	IT HAS TO BE MADE F FROM
Line_6208	UM THEY CHANGED THEIR BATTERY POWER WHEN THEIR USE TOO MUCH AND IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP IT A LOT BUT YEAH THEY MENTIONED THE THING YOU JUST MENTIONED TO ME
Line_6209	IT'S A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB STAND WIRES AND A LITTLE STAND FOR EVERYTHING TO GO INTO
Line_6210	TO HAVE ENOUGH POWER IN THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN OH MY GOSH IN THE BATTERY THE D CELL
Line_6211	WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE IT RECEIVES THE BATTERY AND THE POWER AND ELECTRICITY
Line_6212	WHAT IT CAN DO IS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT GOES POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE
Line_6213	THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE INTO THE BOTTOM INTO THE SIDE
Line_6214	BUT AFTER THAT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING IT WILL JUST STAY THERE AND YEAH
Line_6215	UM ELECTRICITY AND IT FLOWS YEAH AND JUST FLOWS AND STUFF
Line_6216	UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6217	UM THE BATTERY HELPS THAT AND IT MADE IT WORK
Line_6218	IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IT CAN FLOW TO THE POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT FLOWS AND SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_6219	UM IT LIGHTS THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6220	UM ONE GOES TO THE SIDE AND ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6221	UM WELL THE THE POSITIVE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6222	CLOSED IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING FLOWING IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_6223	SO THE POSITIVE GOES TO THE
Line_6224	THE BULB IS CLOSED IT'S NOT OPEN
Line_6225	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT STUFF TO MAKE LIKE A SWITCH WORK AND MAKE THE LIGHT LIT UP
Line_6226	SO THE SWITCH IS WHAT CONTAINS THE UM
Line_6227	UM A LIKE IT HOOKS THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6228	OOP UM THE D CELL BATTERY UM CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_6229	THE D CELL MAKES IT LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE WIRES AND THEN THE MOTOR
Line_6230	UH ELECTRICITY
Line_6231	UM HELPS THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6232	IT CARRIES ELECTRICITY UM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6233	IT CONNECTS AND THAT MAKES IT BOTH LIGHT UP AND THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6234	SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_6235	IT RECEIVES IT AND THEN SHIPS IT OFF TO NEW ORLEANS SORRY
Line_6236	UM IT MAKES IT WORK WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU BY IT IT'S IT SHUTS EVERYTHING UP WELL
Line_6237	HELLO
Line_6238	IT'S MAKING EVERYTHING GO CRAZY
Line_6239	UM WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S BY SO THAT'S MAKING THE FLAG GO THROUGH
Line_6240	IT'S FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_6241	WIRES BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6242	IT'S LETTING THE WIRES TOUCH THE MOTOR AND HELPING IT GO ON AND ON
Line_6243	THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6244	IT'S PROBABLY WHY IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_6245	WELL SEE WELL IT'S JUST A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH
Line_6246	UM THE LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTING TO THE WIRE OH I LOVE UM AND THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR LETTING IT GO THROUGH
Line_6247	A BATTERY A BATTERY THAT HAS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_6248	IT'S THE MOTOR
Line_6249	H THOSE ARE THE WIRES CONNECTING
Line_6250	BATTERY AND MOTOR AND UM WHAT IS THIS
Line_6251	UM WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_6252	THEY'RE VERY VERY STRONG
Line_6253	THERE'S A RIVET AND WASHERS AND THE RIVET'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_6254	IRON
Line_6255	WASHERS AND THE RIVET
Line_6256	A CLOSED
Line_6257	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STRONG SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6258	THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WINDS
Line_6259	FORTY THREE SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S FORTY THREE WASHERS THEY'RE JUST GOING THROUGH
Line_6260	UM THE MORE WIRES YOU PUT IN PROBABLY
Line_6261	THE BATTERY PROBABLY LIKE THE UH POWER
Line_6262	IT PICKS UP MORE WASHERS
Line_6263	TEN THEN IT PROBABLY MEAN THAT THERE'S THREE WASHERS THAT IT'LL PROBABLY PICK UP
Line_6264	SO THEN THAT PROBABLY MEANS YOU KNOW IT'LL PROBABLY BE LIKE THREE
Line_6265	IT D IT LETS IT DOESN'T BRING UP A LOT BUT IT USUALLY DOES PICK UP A LOT
Line_6266	THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT POWER
Line_6267	THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_6268	PROBABLY ON A GRAPH ON A GRAPH IT'D BE GOOD PROBABLY
Line_6269	ON THE SIDE OF THE GRAPH IT REPRESENTS HOW MANY WASHERS WERE PICKED UP
Line_6270	MORE WASHERS TO PICK UP
Line_6271	IT INCREASES BY TWO AND THEN UP TO ONE
Line_6272	IT GOES TO FIFTEEN STILL BUT IT'S GOING FASTER AN
Line_6273	AND I I LIKE UM WHAT THEY DO HERE THEY MAKE IT UP TO GO FROM ZERO
Line_6274	THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STRENGTH
Line_6275	THIRTY THIRTY PROBABLY
Line_6276	PROBABLY TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE
Line_6277	WE'VE BEEN DOING MAGNETISM AND SEEING UM WHAT COULD MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_6278	UM WE IF WE TAKE AN ALUMINUM NAIL IT ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE THE MOTOR WORK IF YOU CONNECT THE TWO WIRES TO IT
Line_6279	A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET A MOTOR WORK
Line_6280	UM IT THE ALUMINUM NAIL IS MAKING IT WORK THE MOTORS WORK
Line_6281	UM A MOTOR AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE CONDUCTORS WOULD HELP S UM WOULD HELP THE CIRCUIT RUN WHICH IS THE NEVERMIND
Line_6282	INSULATORS ARE STUFF THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM AND THAT DON'T WORK
Line_6283	THEY DON'T INSULATORS DON'T HAVE ANY THEY WON'T LET THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM
Line_6284	WHEN I CLICKED THE SPONGE THE MOTOR DIDN'T WORK IT JUST SAT THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE
Line_6285	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK CAUSE THE INSULATOR SHUTS DOW
Line_6286	UM UH WELL UM WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM IF IT'S
Line_6287	THE STEEL NAIL UM HAS M IRON IN IT AND METAL
Line_6288	WHY IS SHE SHE'S NOT UM TURNING OFF
Line_6289	MASS WEIGHT
Line_6290	IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH S SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6291	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY I'M SORRY
Line_6292	THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
Line_6293	UM YOU COULD FILL IT TO THE BRIM
Line_6294	YOU HAVE TO FILL IT TO THE BRIM
Line_6295	YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND POUR ONE WATER TWO WATER LE AND SO ON AND SO ON UNTIL YOU GET
Line_6296	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT I DON'T
Line_6297	YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND DO IT I GUESS
Line_6298	MASS L ACTUALLY VOLUME OKAY
Line_6299	IT OPENS A CAN UM AND SHOWS YOU WHAT
Line_6300	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS INSTEAD IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED
Line_6301	IT'S AS MUCH AS THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6302	IT'S THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6303	IT'S NOT PUTTING AS MUCH AS IT COULD
Line_6304	VOLUME IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND HA CAMPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY
Line_6305	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6306	UM I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT WITH MY LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE NOT SAYING THAT I'M DONE BUT
Line_6307	VOLUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAMPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PICTURE
Line_6308	CAMPACITY IS HIGHER THAN THE VOLUME
Line_6309	IT'LL MO IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE THE SYRINGE HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_6310	MEASURE MASS UM THE CAMPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLUME
Line_6311	THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_6312	THE TOOLS OR THE UNITS I
Line_6313	EVERY TEN MILLILITERS
Line_6314	YOU COULD USE SYRINGES AND JUST MEASURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE
Line_6315	YOU COULD JUST USE THE SYRINGE AND SUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD POUR IT OUT
Line_6316	IT SUCKS UP WATER AND THEN IT SPITS IT OUT WHEN YOU PUSH PULL SUCKS IN PUSH S
Line_6317	IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY
Line_6318	YOU COULD SQUIRT IT INTO A BEATER BEAKER NOT A BEATER
Line_6319	COULD FOLLOW IT ON A BEAKER
Line_6320	UH BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE SYRINGE WON'T EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE
Line_6321	YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW I FORGET WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
Line_6322	I YOU'RE WELCOME GOODBYE
Line_6323	WELL WE HAVE
Line_6324	CAPACITY IS THE MEASUREMENT HOW LONG SOMETHING CA CAPACITY
Line_6325	HOW MUCH WATER SOMETHING IS AND THIS PICTURE IS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLIMETERS IT'S JUST IN POSITION
Line_6326	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6327	HOW M MUCH WATER THERE IS IN THE CUP
Line_6328	WE TOOK SODA CANS TO SEE IF THE SODA COMPANY TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT IT OR DIDN'T NOT TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT
Line_6329	THERE'S NO SPACE AT THE TOP
Line_6330	WE USED WE LEFT A LITTLE SPACE INSIDE AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER AND FIGURED OUT HOW MUCH WATER THAT WAS
Line_6331	MEANS THAT THERE'S THREE HUNDRED OF THE MILLILITERS
Line_6332	IT COULD AC IT WILL ACTUALLY HER HOLD MORE THAN IT SAYS BECAUSE THE
Line_6333	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6334	WELL THE CAPACITY HAS
Line_6335	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS
Line_6336	SYRINGE IS ON THE FAR LEFT IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND ON THE SIDE IS ONE LITER
Line_6337	MEASURE THINGS OIL WATER FOR COOKING
Line_6338	AND WE SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT IS CAUSE IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR THE LITER BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THIRTY THREE ON THE SYRINGE BUT THEY SHOW DIFFERENT AMOUNTS SO AND SYRINGES ARE DIFFERENT SIZES TOO
Line_6339	YOU JUST READ HOW MUCH
Line_6340	HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS IN ALL THE SYRINGES PUT TOGETHER
Line_6341	THE UNITS WE USE ARE MILLILITERS MILLILITERS AND LITERS
Line_6342	YOU WOULD MEASURE HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS
Line_6343	NEED OTHER T TO MEASURE CAPACITY SYRINGE ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST TOOL CAUSE IT COULD SUCK UP THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_6344	YOU LOOKED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TOTAL
Line_6345	YOU COULD SENSE THAT IT WAS COLD
Line_6346	UM A THERMOMETER BECAUSE THERMOMETERS CAN TELL YOU A DIFF THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_6347	IT MEASURES SOMETHING AND THE THING THAT A THERMOMETER MEASURES IS TEMPERATURE CELSIUS DEGREES OR FAHRENHEIT DEGREES
Line_6348	THE THIRD AND FIRST CUPS ARE HOTTER THAN THE SECOND AND THE FIRST CUPS
Line_6349	GETS WARMER
Line_6350	WE TOOK THE ICE WATER AND
Line_6351	IT'S FIFTY DEGREE CELSIUS SO IT'S WARMER THAN THE WATER ON THE LEFT WHICH IS TEN DEGREES CELSIUS
Line_6352	TELLS YOU THAT THE WATER'S WARMER THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LITTLE WATER
Line_6353	THE WATER CELSIUS THAT'S MARKED CELSIUS TEN DEGREE CELSIUS
Line_6354	IT'S NEXT BYE MARNIE
Line_6355	AND THE AND C IN CELSIUS GREAT
Line_6356	WELL I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT COLDER AND
Line_6357	THEY HAPPENED AT THE IN THE FIRST HI
Line_6358	A LOT AND THEY GOT REALLY COLD AND WE PUT WEREN'T ALLOWED TO PUT OUR HANDS IN WHICH WAS SAD CAUSE WE WERE HOT
Line_6359	IT GETS IT STAYS THE SAME AND THEN GET WOULD GET
Line_6360	WELL IT STARTED REALLY HIGH AND THEN IT GOT COLDER AND COLDER AN
Line_6361	THE LITTLE RED LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD GOES DOWN
Line_6362	GO IT STARTS HIGH IT STARTED IT STARTED HIGH
Line_6363	WELL IT'S GETTING COLDER AND COLDER AND COLDER
Line_6364	IT TAKES UP MORE SPACE AND STARTS TO BURN
Line_6365	I DISPLAYED IT ON A LINE
Line_6366	I DREW IT WITH LITTLE DOTS ON A LINE GRAPH
Line_6367	OH THERE'S THAT PART IT GOES
Line_6368	WELL IT HELPS YOU
Line_6369	I USE IT TO SAY ALRIGHT THIS IS THIS MANY AND THAT'S THAT MANY AND YEAH
Line_6370	I PUT THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MINUTES OF HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN
Line_6371	THE DOTS ARE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND THEN THE DOTS SHOW IT MOVING DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND WHATEVER
Line_6372	TWENTY DEGREES IS
Line_6373	YOU SEE HOW MANY MINUTES ARE BIN BETWEEN TWENTY AND ZERO
Line_6374	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_6375	STARTING THE FIRST NUMBER AND S ENDING AT THE LAST NUMBER
Line_6376	SHE STARTED AT FIVE ENDED AT TWENTY IT'S FIFTEEN
Line_6377	I'M IF IT'S HIGHER OR L
Line_6378	THE FIRST TWO ARE BELOW FIFTY AND THE SECOND TWO ARE OVER
Line_6379	THAT THE FIRST TWO ARE LOWER THAN FIFTY AND THE SECOND TWO ARE H
Line_6380	HI MY NAME'S
Line_6381	WHAT WE MOST RECENTLY IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MONEY
Line_6382	TO MEASURE THINGS AND ALSO SOME KINDA STICK THERE LITTLE LONGER THAN YARD STICKS
Line_6383	YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS AND IT'S MAINLY ABOUT HOW LONG IT IS
Line_6384	SO WE PUT ONE STRAW IN FRONT OF ANOTHER STRAW ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS TABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG THAT TABLE WAS
Line_6385	BY UM THE REASON WE USED I'M NOT SURE
Line_6386	I THINK THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES SOMETIMES
Line_6387	WE HAD DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRAWS TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFER SO IT COULD LOOK LIKE I THINK
Line_6388	IT WAS SEVEN STRAWS FOR GROUP A
Line_6389	THEY'RE THE SAME FOR THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS
Line_6390	YOU NEED TO USE THE SAME SIZE
Line_6391	IT MEANS KILOMETERS
Line_6392	ET ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
Line_6393	SO WE MATED AND WE ME AND MY PINKIE'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT
Line_6394	USED THEM TO I'M NOT SURE
Line_6395	BECAUSE THAT SHOWS YOU S BECAUSE THE IT SHOW YOU NUMBERS AND IT'S EASIER SO YOU KNOW
Line_6396	THERE'S THEY'RE USED IN SCIENCE BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU MEASURE
Line_6397	THEY'RE ALL SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT USES
Line_6398	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT SIZES OF THINGS AND IT'S A SCIENTIFIC WAY IN LENGTH AND WIDTH
Line_6399	THERE'S ONE INCH IN THE UNIT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
Line_6400	YOUR PINKIE OR YOUR HAND OR YOUR FOOT
Line_6401	THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
Line_6402	WELL IT SEEMS KIND OF LIKE YOU ARE
Line_6403	MEASURING IT WITH YOUR PINKIE OR WITH YOUR HAND OR FEET OR PART OF YOUR BODY BY MEASURING IT THAT WAY
Line_6404	UM TWENTY F NO SEVEN INCHES AND THEN THE OTHER WAY IT WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY INCHES AND THAT'S WHY AND I MEASURED BY COUNTING HOW MANY HANDS THERE WERE
Line_6405	FORTY EIGHT INCHES LONG BECAUSE IS AND IT HELPS WHEN YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS SO THAT IF YOU CARRY IT WITH YOU ALL THE TIME YOU CAN ESTIMATE BY USING HOW MANY OF THAT THING IS
Line_6406	WELL IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING A TON OF TIMES YOU'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE TIMES GONNA GET THE RIGHT ESTIMATE SO IT HELPS YOU
Line_6407	BETTER AT ESTIMATING BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU GET BETTER AND GET THE CLOSER ESTIMATE
Line_6408	O YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6409	AT A HORSE RANCH YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE CARRYING MEASURING TAPE AROUND BUT IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG YOUR HORSE WAS YOU'D PROBABLY NEED TO ESTIMATE
Line_6410	USE A MEASURING TAPE OR A C USE YOUR HAND OR A
Line_6411	IT HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6412	BECAUSE METER TAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND HANDS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6413	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_6414	IT SHOWS YOU THAT IF YOU BEGIN AT ONE END END AND END AT THE OTHER
Line_6415	GINNING AND END OF THE
Line_6416	IT FELT KIND OF HARD BECAUSE NOBODY HAD THE EXACT RIGHT WAY TO MEASURE SOMEBODY'S HEIGHT
Line_6417	WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIGURED OUT THE CLOSEST GUESS WE COULD GET TO WITH OUR FRIEND
Line_6418	WE NEEDED TO USE THE CORRECT TECHNIQUES THAT NIQUES THAT THE TEACHER RECOMMENDED
Line_6419	T'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN IF THE ANSWER'S THE SAME ANSWER TWICE THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT CORRECT ANSWER
Line_6420	IT WAS A LITTLE HARD BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE SAME RESULTS BUT IT CAME OUT A LOT DIFFERENTLY
Line_6421	A METER TAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY CAUSE YOU'D PROBABLY BREAK THE METER STICK OR AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO MOVE
Line_6422	BIG THE OBJECT WAS BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING RE
Line_6423	THE FINGER IS THE SAME SIZE AS ONE KILOMETER
Line_6424	IT GIVES US A REFERENCE TO DO STUFF BECAUSE RENFRECES ARE IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL
Line_6425	THERE WEREN'T REALLY ANY BODY PART MEASUREMENTS THAT WERE THE SAME CAUSE WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH MEASURING BEFORE WE LEFT FOR THUS
Line_6426	THE FOOT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FOREARM
Line_6427	PARTS ARE THE SES BUT OTHERS AREN'T NO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BODY PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME SIZE EVERY BODY PARTS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT T
Line_6428	YOU PROBABLY USE THE REFERENCE FOR THE PINKIE AS TWO INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_6429	YOU USE THE SMALLEST YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED
Line_6430	I GUESS I THINK IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING I'M NOT SURE
Line_6431	YOU'D USE THEM WHEN YOU WERE USING A METER STICK OR WHEN YOU NEEDED TO MEASURE SOMETHING
Line_6432	WE JUST STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MASS TODAY IN MISSES STRINE'S CLASS
Line_6433	UM WE MEASURED THE MASS AND ESTIMATED THEN WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND WITH A SCALE TWICE
Line_6434	USE A SCALE TO FIGURE OUT THE WEIGHT
Line_6435	THAT IT MAKES IT
Line_6436	WELL YOU COULD USE DIFFERENT REFERENCES TO MEASURE THEM
Line_6437	IT'S A PAPER CLIP
Line_6438	GROUP TWO HAS A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND GROUP ONE HAS A SMALLER PAPER CLIP
Line_6439	YOU COULD HAVE THEM WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD HAVE THEM USE THE SAME SIZE INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT SIZE
Line_6440	GROUP TWO HAS SMALLER RESULTS GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER RESULTS
Line_6441	THAT'S ONE GRAM WE USED THOSE FOR MEASURING HOW MUCH STUFF WEIGHED
Line_6442	WE MEASURED THE THINGS WE USED IN SCIENCE
Line_6443	GIVES YOU A MORE EXACT ANSWER
Line_6444	I KNOW THAT IT WEIGHS MORE THAN THE SMALL ONE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND MASS
Line_6445	THE LARGE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_6446	WELL THE WEIGHT OF THE METAL DISK IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY GRAMS THERE ARE IN THE
Line_6447	IT'S IN A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINE
Line_6448	WELL I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT
Line_6449	BECAUSE WE'RE MEASURING WITH GRAMS
Line_6450	ONE GRAM FIVE ONE GRAM FIVE IT MA IT TELLS YOU
Line_6451	THEY'RE BEING USED TO MEASURE THE MASS OF THE PIECE OF WOOD
Line_6452	AN SAY ALRIGHT THE PENCIL IS TWO NICKELS THAT MUST MEAN IT'S TEN GRAMS
Line_6453	A METAL DISK WEIGHS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6454	THE TOY CAR WEIGHS SEVENTY GRAMS
Line_6455	UM S ONE YELLOW PIECE EQUALS FIVE BLUE ONE RED PIECE EQUALS FIVE EQUALS TEN BLUE ONE GRAM PIECE EQUALS
Line_6456	IT'S GONNA TO BE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE SIDES SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE
Line_6457	THE ORANGE WEIGHS MORE THAN ALL THE GRAM PIECES IN THE CUP
Line_6458	GRAVEL AND PUT IT IN A PLASTIC BAG THEN WE MEASURED IT OUT WITH SOME OF THE LITTLE PIECES TO MAKE FIFTY GRAMS AND WE DID IT TWICE SO WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND WE MADE A BAG OF KILOMETERS
Line_6459	THE ORANGE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_6460	IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS TOO
Line_6461	A KILOGRAM IS TEN OF ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6462	YO YOU NEED TO USE A SCALE
Line_6463	TWO THREE AND EIGHT
Line_6464	WELL WE'VE BEEN TODAY WE WORKED WITH A SPONGE AND WATER
Line_6465	SPONGE ON THE LEFT IS DRY THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND THE SPONGE ON THE RIGHT IS SOAKED AND THEY GREW AS THEY GOT WET AND DREW DRY
Line_6466	WELL IT'S A SPONGE THAT IS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET
Line_6467	IT'S A WET SPONGE WHICH MEANS IT HASN'T GONE ALL THE WAY TO SOAK A SOAKED SPONGE BUT IT IS STILL GETTING BIG IT'S STILL BIGGER THAN
Line_6468	IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOTALLY WET AND IT'S YOU IT'S DRIPPING REALLY WET
Line_6469	WHEN IT'S ALL THE WAY WHEN IT'S THE LARGEST IT CAN GET
Line_6470	YOU CAN TAKE THE WET SPONGE YOU CAN USE A SPONGE AND USE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6471	BECAUSE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE SPONGE GET
Line_6472	YOU USE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6473	SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS LONG
Line_6474	A SPONGE WEIGHS THREE GRAMS
Line_6475	IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_6476	IT'S UM SIXTEEN GRAMS LONG IT'S SIXTEEN GRAMS IN WEIGHT
Line_6477	YOU CAN UM IF YOU CAN MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE
Line_6478	SO YOU MEASURED THEM BOTH OUT AND THE ANSWER IS THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER CAUSE YOU TOOK THREE AWAY
Line_6479	IT CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_6480	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE
Line_6481	I WOULD PROBABLY DO ONE PART AT A TIME
Line_6482	SHE'S NOT TALKING YES
Line_6483	IT MAINLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT IN THE CUP
Line_6484	YOU GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME ARE CAUSE THE GROUP ONE IS BIGGER AND GROUP TWO IS SMALL
Line_6485	IT'S A PICTURE OF A LITER
Line_6486	WELL WE CAN MEASURE DIFFERENT WATERS AMOUNTS OF WATERS OW
Line_6487	WE'RE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE CUP
Line_6488	USE IT I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT UM SO WE CAN USE IT TO MEASURE OUT THE AMOUNT
Line_6489	THE LITTLE SPIN IS ONE MILLIMETER AND SO THE THING IS ONE HUNDRED MILLIMETERS
Line_6490	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6491	I'VE USED THEM IN COOKING
Line_6492	IT'S FOR VALUES WHICH IS EIGHTY EIGHT AND GROUP ONE'S IS FOUR WHICH IS EIGHTY EIGHT MILLIMETERS UM
Line_6493	MORE WATER
Line_6494	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6495	YOU CAN USE UM
Line_6496	IT'S P PUSHING THE WATER INSIDE THROUGHOUT THE FRONT
Line_6497	YOU WOULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND READ HOW MANY IT WAS
Line_6498	THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT TYNPES OF MILLIMETERS
Line_6499	MEASURED WATER
Line_6500	THAT WAS ABOUT CUP S OKAY
Line_6501	WATER A B C AND D THROUGH THAT A THROUGH D
Line_6502	WELL
Line_6503	A SPONGRENG OR WHATEVER LITTLE SQUIRTY THING'S CALLED
Line_6504	THEY TELL YOU TO THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS AND DO YOU CALL THIS A CONVERSATION
Line_6505	ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN SO EACH ONE S WA
Line_6506	EACH LINE REPRESENTED TWO IT DIDN'T HAVE THE DARKER LINES THAT THEY
Line_6507	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6508	FIFTY'S THE MAXIMUM THAT'S HALF OF ONE HUNDRED
Line_6509	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6510	ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GALLONS
Line_6511	LOOK ON THE BACK AND SEE WHAT THE VOLUME SAYS
Line_6512	HOW MUCH THERE WAS FROM THE BOTTOM OF B
Line_6513	EACH ONE IS FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_6514	THE VOLUME OF WHAT'S IN THE CUP
Line_6515	YOU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_6516	TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER ARE FILLED WITH VESSELS
Line_6517	THEY'RE CONTAINERS
Line_6518	TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_6519	THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES BUT THEY'RE THE SAME OTHERWISE
Line_6520	IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER TO IT DO IT
Line_6521	THAT THE SHAPE AND THE VOLUME AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME THE VOLUME AND IT DON'T MATTER BUT THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER DOES
Line_6522	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT UM MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_6523	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A SURFACE UM BLOCKING IT THEY STILL CAN STICK
Line_6524	I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN
Line_6525	WELL ON THE TH THICKER PAPER IT WON'T STICK CAUSE IT'S TOO THICK BUT ON THE THINNER PAPER IT'S THIN SO IT CAN STICK
Line_6526	I DON'T KNOW REALLY
Line_6527	WELL THE LONG SILVER OBJECT IS A NAIL AND SO UM WHEN THE MAGNET'S ON THE NAIL IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6528	I'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6529	WE WERE UM WE WERE DOING MEASURING AND YEAH THAT STUFF
Line_6530	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6531	YES UM MAINLY IT WAS THE WASHER
Line_6532	WHAT HOW TIGHT THE MOLECULES ARE MOLECULES ARE SORRY
Line_6533	NO WE USED A SCALE
Line_6534	COUNTER WEIGHTS ARE THINGS THAT MAKE OTHER THINGS ON A SCALE EVEN LIKE LIKE STRAIGHT SIDE TO SIDE
Line_6535	I DON'T KNOW YOU WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6536	CAUSE METAL WEIGHS MORE THAN PLASTIC
Line_6537	IT WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_6538	BALANCE BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT RIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_6539	YES IF IT'S ON A SCALE
Line_6540	A PLASTIC CHIP AND PAPERCLIPS ARE ON A SCALE AND CUPS AND THEY'RE EQUAL
Line_6541	WE'VE BEEN DOING THE VISION AND WEIGHING
Line_6542	THE PLASTIC CHIP THEN THE WOODEN CUBE THEN THE METAL RING
Line_6543	WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
Line_6544	THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_6545	A THAT'S ALL I THINK
Line_6546	UM YOU COULD UM GET IT WRONG OR RIGHT AND UM YOU MIGHT ESTIMATE
Line_6547	TWENTY AND THAT'S IT I THINK THAT'S IT
Line_6548	UM IT'S HOW MUCH THEY ARE IN CELSIUS
Line_6549	UM CAUSE ONE IF YOU DO IT WHILE IT'S STILL MOVING YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
Line_6550	YOU PLACE IT UNDER WATER CAUSE AND THEN THE UM ALCOHOL COULD GO UP GOES UP OR DOWN
Line_6551	HOW UM HOW MUCH HOW HOT OR COLD THEY HOW HOT THEY OR COLD THEY ARE IN CELSIUS
Line_6552	UM WE HAVE BEEN UM MEASURING VOLUME UM AND WEIGHT YEAH
Line_6553	MARNIE I DON'T GET THAT
Line_6554	AND THE AND THE GRAMS WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SPONGE WOULD
Line_6555	BYE THANKS THANKS FOR LETTING ME TEACH YOU BYE MARNIE
Line_6556	OH YEAH TODAY WE MEASURED HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE CAN TAKE UP
Line_6557	WE USED GRAMS BECAUSE
Line_6558	I THINK THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT
Line_6559	THE METAL DISC WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6560	UM YEAH THAT'S BASICALLY YEAH
Line_6561	YEAH WE HAD THAT IN OUR CLASS THAT AND THEN WE USED THERMO
Line_6562	WELL THERE'S LITTLE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND YOU READ THE TEMPERATURE THERE
Line_6563	I THINK IT'S THE DEGREE THAT WATER BOILS AT
Line_6564	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER AND UM STUFF LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6565	GRAMS ARE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND
Line_6566	YOU CA YOU COMPARE IT WITH THE NICKEL
Line_6567	UM WHAT WHAT STUFF WHAT STUFF EQUAL
Line_6568	AND TWO AND TEN GRAMS EQUALS ONE TEN BIG GRAM
Line_6569	YOU FIRST PUT IN THE ORANGE AND THEN YOU
Line_6570	THE ORANGE WEIGHS A LOT MORE THAN THOSE GRAMS
Line_6571	FIVE TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6572	UM WHICH ONE WAS HOTTER AND WHICH ONE WAS COLDER
Line_6573	THE ROBOT IS STICKING HIS FINGER IN CUP B TO SEE IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_6574	IT MEANS THAT A IS UM IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM C AND C IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM B
Line_6575	WHICH ONE IS HOTTER
Line_6576	UM YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE UM THE TEMPERATURE OR YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR FINGER
Line_6577	YOU STICK A THERMOMETER IN AND THEN IF THEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS
Line_6578	WE WANT TO USE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_6579	UM I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_6580	YOU WOULD LOOK UM CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT TEMPERATURE IT WAS
Line_6581	ON SOME IT'S REALLY HOT AND ON SOME IT'S REALLY COLD
Line_6582	THE THERMOMETER IS
Line_6583	THE UM
Line_6584	IT'S THE ALCOHOL
Line_6585	THE THE ICE WATER I MEAN THE ICE IT MELTS IN THE WATER AND THEN IT MAKES IT AND THEN THE ICE MAKES IT COLDER
Line_6586	UM THE ICE IS DROPPING INTO CUP THE B CUP AND
Line_6587	AND TODAY
Line_6588	T WE PUT IN ONE SIDE OF THE SCALE AND THEN WE WEIGHED IT TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS BY PUTTING GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER SIDE
Line_6589	WELL THERE'S ONE GRAMS FIVE GRAMS TEN GRAMS AND TWENTY GRAMS
Line_6590	WELL IT TAKES LIKE THE DISK THE METAL DISK IS BALANCED WITH THE GRAM WEIGHTS
Line_6591	WELL YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF DIFFERENT WELL Y YOU CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LOT OF DIFF
Line_6592	THINGS YOU CAN WATER AND THEY ARE TH PRETTY MUCH THE EASIEST ONES AND THE ONLY ONES THAT WE'VE DONE
Line_6593	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS HOTTEST AND WHICH WAS COLDEST AND WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6594	HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_6595	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THEM SOME OF THE CUPS ARE GOING TO BE COLDER THAN OTHERS
Line_6596	IT WANTS TO EXPAND SO WHAT GOES UP THE LITTLE TUBE THAT IT'S IN
Line_6597	WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT WANTS TO EXPAND IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS HOTTER
Line_6598	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
Line_6599	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURES LENGTH CAPACITY AND MASSES
Line_6600	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT IT IS OR HOW COLD IT
Line_6601	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS THE COLDEST AND WHICH WAS THE MEDIUM AND WHICH WAS THE HOTTEST I MEAN WARMEST
Line_6602	ROBERT IS INSERTING ONE OF HIS FINGERS INTO THE CUP B
Line_6603	WELL FIRST IT WAS AT TWENTY DEGREES THEN IT DROPPED TO FIVE DEGREES THEN IT EVENTUALLY WENT UP
Line_6604	WELL OBSERVATIONS ARE
Line_6605	WELL OBSERVATIONS ARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS AND MAKE GRAPHS AND CHARTS ABOUT THE THINGS AND YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT
Line_6606	I LIKE SCIENCE VERY MUCH AND SCIENCE IS MY FAVORITE LEARNING SUBJECT
Line_6607	HUNDRED UH ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IS BOILING POINT SO THE WATER WILL BE BOILING
Line_6608	BOILING IS VERY VERY HOT
Line_6609	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPONGES CAN ABSORB
Line_6610	THE LE THE LEFT ONE IS DRY THE MIDDLE ONE IS WET AND THE RIGHT ONE IS SOAKED
Line_6611	IT ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER
Line_6612	IT'S SORT OF CRACKLES
Line_6613	IT'S WET SO IT MOVES IT'S WET SO IT MOVES MORE EASILY AND IT'S ABSORBED SOME WATER
Line_6614	SPONGE HAS GOTTEN BIGGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS HARD
Line_6615	THE WATER DRIPS OUT AND IT GETS AN IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
Line_6616	WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITHOUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET
Line_6617	THE SPONGE HAS ABSORBED WATER AND SO IT'S TIPPING THE BALANCE SCALE
Line_6618	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE
Line_6619	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE IT'S ABSORBING WATER
Line_6620	GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONGE AND IT WAS EQUAL
Line_6621	WE HAVE MEASURED TEMPERATURE
Line_6622	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT OR HOW COLD THINGS ARE AND YOU CAN USE THERMOMETERS TO TELL
Line_6623	WHICH WAS THE COLDEST AND WHICH WAS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6624	WAS AND IF IT WAS THE COLDEST OR THE WARMEST
Line_6625	THE ROBOT IS TESTING CUP B WITH HIS FINGER
Line_6626	IT MEANS THAT SOME HAVE HIGHER DEGREES THAN OTHERS AND THIS ROBOT IS TRYING TO TELL
Line_6627	WHICH ONE IS COLDEST WARMEST AND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6628	WATER AIR US AND
Line_6629	MEASURED THE EXACT DEGREES AND HOW DIFFERENT ALL THE CLASS'S MEASUREMENTS WERE
Line_6630	IT SHOWS HOW MANY DEGREES THAT THE THING IT'S IN ARE
Line_6631	THEY SHOW HOW MANY DEGREES THE THING THAT THEY'RE IN IS
Line_6632	WE CAN DO CELSIUS OR FAHRENHEIT THESE THERMOMETER SHOW CELSIUS
Line_6633	WE WERE CHECKING THE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE EVERY MINUTE
Line_6634	WE NOTICED SORT A SAME THE SAME DEGREES AND IT SORT OF ROSE AFTER A FEW MINUTES SLOWLY
Line_6635	THE ICE CUBES WILL MELT AND THE WATER WILL GET WARMER
Line_6636	IT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE ICE CUBE IS FROZEN WATER SO IT'S COLD
Line_6637	I SEE FIFTEEN DEGREES DIFFERENCE
Line_6638	CAN WRITE IT DOWN OF COURSE OR
Line_6639	I SEE THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN A LOT A LOT A LOT AND THEN SLOWLY GOING UPWARD
Line_6640	UM KIND OF JUST SOAKED UP ALL THE WATER THAT IT CAN HOLD
Line_6641	N IT'S KIND OF BEEN JUST SOAKING UP WATER
Line_6642	UM THE UM
Line_6643	S I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A SOAP SPONGE IS
Line_6644	THANKS MY DEAR BYE
Line_6645	UM MA UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6646	WE MEASURED HOW WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND SAW HOW COLD IT WAS
Line_6647	UM WE MEASURED HOW COLD IT WAS A WITH A THERMOMETER AND UM THE B WAS COLDEST
Line_6648	HOW COLD AND HOW HOT IT WAS
Line_6649	OKAY WE WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD WITH A WEIGHT WITH A WEIGHT LAST WEEK
Line_6650	WE COULD USE A RULER AND MEASURE HOW HIGH IT WENT UP TO
Line_6651	IT COULD TELL US HOW HIGH THE CUP CO THE CUP COULD HOLD WATER
Line_6652	OKAY THE VOLUME OF LIQUID AND THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN
Line_6653	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_6654	THE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND THE CAPACITY NO THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD THE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT'S HOLDING NOW
Line_6655	I COULD FILL IT UP TO THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6656	WE COULD USE A SY SYRINGE AND MEASURE HOW MUCH
Line_6657	WE COULD USE A SYRINGE TO MEASURE IT
Line_6658	I DID THANKS

Line_0	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND ABOUT THE URBODS A SYSTEM A SUCACES SYSTEM AND THE EARTH IS A S
Line_1	A CAUSE SUCASE THE RTH A HUMAN BODY
Line_2	IT CARS A SISTOM WITH THE MANY PARTS LIKE THE WEASEL
Line_3	THE CAR HAS MAD PARTS LIKE THE U
Line_4	TE MANY PARTS IT HAS
Line_5	EL HE HELPS IT ROLL
Line_6	HUMAN BODY IS ALSO IS
Line_7	IT SHOWED ME PART OF PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND WHAT MAKES IT A
Line_8	H W ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE HEART CONNECTS TO AND THE BLOOD VESSEL
Line_9	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKES IT A SYSTEM
Line_10	THE EARTH IS ALSO A
Line_11	IT IT HAS LAND IT ALSO HAS WATER AND IT HAS E FOR STEEL'S

Line_16	THIS PICTURE SHOWS ME A MAYBE A SHOW SLAPS AND LIFE
Line_17	WHAT ANIMALS EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS GET EATEN BY ANIMALS ARE PART OF THE B
Line_18	A PINE TREE AND PRODUCES IT'S FOODS
Line_19	ABOUT D COMPOSERS CONSUMERS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE PIC DIE PRODUCE
Line_20	THIS SHOWS US CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSERS
Line_21	DECOMPOSERS CONSUNARS AND PRODUCERS
Line_22	WHEN THEY EAT THE FRUDS THE ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_23	COSUMARS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND CONSUMERS CAN GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_24	IT CONSUMER THAT EAT ANOTHER ANIMAL OR A CONSUMER THAT THE ANIMAL GOT TO EAT A BYE MAYBE
Line_25	THE RAT WELL THEY BOTH KIND OF EAT LIKE PLANTS AND THEY BOTH GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS

Line_33	RED WORMS EAT DECAYED METAL
Line_34	THEY ARE CHOMPING THE PAPER AND LEAVES AND TURNING IT INTO THE THAT MEANS THEY ARE COMPOSTING
Line_35	IT TURNS INTO DIRT OR SO
Line_36	THE TWICE IS THE WORMS FOOD
Line_37	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT UP THE GROWTH OF PLANTS
Line_38	SOMETHING WITH GIRL
Line_39	WELL IT'S ONLY I DON'T THE MOONS ACID
Line_40	ON THE END SO E
Line_41	IT'S ONE THING THAT IS TO YE

Line_51	THE THAT COULD BE A PUMP BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GET IT'S FOOD IT COULD PROBABLY MAKE DIE
Line_52	H HOW MANY
Line_53	IT NEEDS A A SAFE PLACE TO REST
Line_54	NO BECAUSE PLANTS ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WILL NOT HAVE SHELTER BUT THEY MOSTLY DO MEAN THIS
Line_55	PLEASE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_56	MY THEIR BLOOD CELLS AND THERE ARE LEAVES
Line_57	THE FOOD THEY THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH THE LIGHT'S FROM THE SUN AND THE ENERGY
Line_58	IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY OF THIS STUFF THEN IT A GARANTEEED AND A DOG
Line_59	PRODUCING THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_60	IT'S DURING IT'S
Line_61	IT'S NOT GETTING THE RIGHT MATERIALS THAT IT NEARDS TO LIVE
Line_62	IT MEANS IT'S GETTING TO FOOD AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY FOOD IT'S NOT GOING TO LIVE

Line_64	IT'S ALSO NOT GETTING WHEN I LIKE IT ALSO MEANS
Line_65	HAS NOT ONE OF THEM GUESS OF MATERIALS THAT IT S AND IF IT DOESN'T GET THAT IT'S NOT GO IN UH RECEED AND LIVE IT'S LIFE
Line_66	IT DOESN'T NEED AS MUCH AS IT NEEDS WITH WATERS
Line_67	IT DIDN'T HAVE WHEN OR SOME BRIGHT
Line_68	THEN THAT MEANS IT'S GETTING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT IT MEANS
Line_69	THAT FUEL WEBS ARE IMPORTANT TO LIFE
Line_70	THAT FLAMS ARE IN
Line_71	IT STARTS WITH THE DECOMPOSERS THEN TO THE PRODUCER THEN TO THE CONSUMERS
Line_72	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WE PLANTS LIVING THINGS AND HOW PLANTS NEED AIR SUN AND WATER
Line_73	THAT'S IS MOOSE
Line_74	WEIGHED A SECOND IT THE RIGHT TO SOME SUPPOSED TO BE GOING INTO
Line_75	GOOD HOW ARE YOU I
Line_76	HE'S ALL AND CISTLES

Line_87	THEY ARE BULBS
Line_88	IT THEY BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT BLOOD CELLS S
Line_89	LILLS
Line_90	BUT THEY'RE JUST LIKE THAT THEY ARE JUST LIKE ANIMALS
Line_91	THEY ARE ALL LIVING ISTOMS
Line_92	PLANS BECAUSE THE WHEN HER THAT BLOOD S
Line_93	A BUTT OF SIDE IS A LIVING

Line_101	IT IS LIKE A TWO O
Line_102	THAT THEY ARE LIKE THE SAME
Line_103	WARN JUST AND A S SMALL AND TEST
Line_104	WE RUN OVER OF THE HUMAN BODY WHEN OVER BLOOD CELLS THE ANT OVER TO JUDGE JUST A CISTM
Line_105	WHAT'S YOUR NAME
Line_106	LEAFS THIS IS A LEAF WITH BUT VAN YOU COULD SEE
Line_107	LIKE UM THOSE DIFFERENT TIMES O LEAVES THAT BUT I'VE FORGOT TEN WELL

Line_133	COW IT USES THE RATTLE AND THE TAIL
Line_134	ANIMALS AND A STEEL CHING S
Line_135	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING ISTMS
Line_136	MY BODY AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE SO CASE MEANING ONE BECAUSE THE SO CASE HAD A TON OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MADE UP THE SO CASES
Line_137	I THINK THERE IS BURNING VERY MANY PARTS OF THE END THAT'S MOVING AND MAKING THE ENTIRE CARD WORK
Line_138	I THINK IT'S LIKE A SUBSISTM AND SISTOM IS A LITTLE SISTOM THAT MAKES UP A BIG SISTOM
Line_139	I THINK IT'S A SISTOM BECAUSE THERE IS TURNS OF DIFFERENT THING WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MOVE AND STOP

Line_152	WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE A LIVING THING AND IF THEY'RE LIVING THEY EAT AND STUFF BUT THEY'RE DORMENT
Line_153	I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE USE IS A LIVING THING
Line_154	MAYBE IT'S THE CAUSE IS FINALLY WAKING UP
Line_155	DIRT WATER AND THE SUNLIGHT
Line_156	ANE TRENDS FROM THE SOIL
Line_157	I THINK PLANTS NEED THE SUN
Line_158	NO I DON'T THINK IT REALLY WOULD
Line_159	PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD SO WE DON'T HAVE TO NEED THEM
Line_160	I THINK THAT'S TOMATO WES
Line_161	THE I DON'T THINK THEY NEEDED BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_162	YES THEY DO INEAN THAT
Line_163	THE SUN MAKES IT LOOK GREEN AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY SUN IT WON'T BE GREEN
Line_164	IT'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH AIR SO IT'S GOING TO SHRIVEL UP AND DIE
Line_165	THEY HAS ALL THE CEFINNIESE TO GROW
Line_166	S MICE AND HEALTHY AND IT GEES FREE TO GROW
Line_167	IT'S WHAT EATS WHO AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_168	PRODUCERS ARE USUALLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD WEB WHICH MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT EATS ITS
Line_169	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE VASCULAR SISTOM AND PLANTS AND VASCULAR MEANS SPINS
Line_170	SOME LEAVES ARE DIFFERENT PLANTS AND SOME AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THEIR RANGE A TO BE GOING
Line_171	PEN PALMATE HAND PARALLEL
Line_172	WELL WE HAVE MAIN ON ANIMALS
Line_173	THE VASCULAR SISTM IT IT CARRIES ALL THE FOOD AND NEW TRANS AND WE
Line_174	I THINK IT COMES FROM THE LEAF BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES
Line_175	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_176	IT WARNS ANIMALS TO STAY AWAY OR THEY CAN BE SPRAYED D
Line_177	THE CARRY DOESN'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE SCALES IT'S TAIL IS UP AND THAT MEANS IT MINDS RIGHT
Line_178	WHEN IT AS A TAIL IT CAN SPRAY PEOPLE THAT MAKES THEM STICK FOR DA

Line_183	THIS IS A NOMEN BEHAVIOR
Line_184	A CAT IS PULLING OUT OF A TREE
Line_185	IT HAS MANY SUBSISTOMS AND SISTOMS IN IT
Line_186	IT COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF A SISTOM AND IT RELATES TO MY SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SISTOMS
Line_187	ALL OF ITS SUBSISTOUMS THE SISTUM
Line_188	SISTM IT'S A SISTM
Line_189	IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND MAYBE HARD TO UNDERSTAND
Line_190	THEY ALL COVER ALMOST ALL OF THE BODY AND THAT PROBABLY MEANS THEY ALL HELPS THE BODY IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_191	THESE WORDS ARE A LITTLE HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND COULD YOU PLEASE TALK IN A LESS COMPLICATED WAYS

Line_427	THAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR FOOD GOES DOWN TO YOUR STUMMICK
Line_428	IT HELPS YOU SWALLOW DOWN THE FOOD AND UH
Line_429	THAT'S WHERE ALRNIA FOOD GOES
Line_430	THEY ALSO HELP YOU DIGEST YOUR FOOD
Line_431	ABOUT LIKE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEAVES AND LIKE THE DIFFERENT NAMES AND ABOUT THE ROUTS IN THE LEAVES
Line_432	THAT THERE IS A PINE A PALMAY AND A PARALLEL
Line_433	ALL THE GROUTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEIR SHAPE IS DIFFERENT
Line_434	THERE IS THREE KINDS OF VAN THERE IS PALM PIONNET AND PARALLEL
Line_435	ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW YOUR FOOD DIGESTS AND HOW YOU BREETH
Line_436	YOU'RE A SOFFIGIIS IN YOUR MOUTH
Line_437	THEY ALL HELP YOU LIKE DO JUST YOUR FOODS
Line_438	THE LINE SNOWS NOW THE BRONCHI DIEFRAM
Line_439	BECAUSE IF YOU COULDN'T BREATHE YOU WOULDN'T BE ALIVE AND A
Line_440	WHAT THIS IS LIKE HOW IT GOES THROUGH
Line_441	IT GETS THE BREATHING FOR IN HUMANS
Line_442	THEY HELP YOU LIKE PUMP AIR OUT OF YOUR SISTOM- AND THEN BACK AGAIN
Line_443	THAT LIKE IT'S LIKE THAT LONG BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING YOU PUMP AIR AND PUMPS IT OUT
Line_444	BRO ONE CUT BRUNCLES
Line_445	UM HELPING PUMP THE AIR AND YOUR LUNGS AND OUT TOO
Line_446	THE IT GETS RID OF ALL THE BAD AIR
Line_447	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_448	ABOUT LIKE UM LIKE THE LUNGS AND HOW WE BREETH
Line_449	IT WELL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW ANIMALS LIKE USE ATTRACTIONS TO CALL MATES OR SENSES DANGER
Line_450	THAT THEY ALL CALL FOR MATES AND HENCE DANGER AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW AND THEY TRY TO GET AWAY FROM PADDLARS AND YEAH
Line_451	WELL THE SONG WILL USE ITS SMELL BECAUSE IT STINKS LIKE REALLY THAT IT WILL USE IT SMELL TO MAKE PREDATORS GO AWAY
Line_452	IT IS LIKE ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS THAT IT BLUES IN WITH THE SAND SO IF ONE OF ITS PLEARS COME BY IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
Line_453	WELL IT LIKE COULD BLEND IN TO THE CORAL
Line_454	THE THAT ITS FEET THIS LITTLE TINY LITTLE CUTE LITTLE FEET
Line_455	BECAUSE IS LIKE THE RIGHT KIND OF WEB KIND OF AND LIKE IT IT'S REALLY LIKE IT HELPS IT PUSH
Line_456	NUMBER TWO DOES BECAUSE THEY'RE CANINE TEETH AND THEY REALLY SHARP AND HELPS THEM LIKE CHOO IT UP
Line_457	I THINK THAT IT'S UM WINDS TOO SO IT COULD FLY AWAY
Line_458	BECAUSE LIKE THERE SHOW BRIGHT AND THEY THEIR WINGS IT CAN HELP IT FLIES AWAY FROM PRELARS
Line_459	WELL SHE'S LIKE LIKE THE SNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL WITH HIS RATTLE
Line_460	WELL SO THE HUMAN DOESN'T GET HURT HE IS JUST GIVING HER A SIMPLE WARM
Line_461	WELL THE SNAKE IS THE STIMMUES AND THE GIRL IS THE REACTION
Line_462	WELL THE THE SKUNC IS LIKE MAKING HIS SMELL SO THE CIOTY WILL GO AWAY FROM
Line_463	THAT HIS SMELL IS LIKE SONG SMELL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY
Line_464	IT COULD HAVE A REALLY WEARED REACTION
Line_465	'S ABOUT STIMULAS AND IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ACTUALLY LIKE REACTIONS AND STUFF
Line_466	THAT WILL SHOW A STIMULUS AND AND REACTION I RE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_467	THEY ARE LIKE MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET COLD ON WHERE THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE
Line_468	IN STINK COAL BEHAVIOR
Line_469	WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE SEEING LIKE TO WAY CAL I JUST GOT THAT ON SPEAKER OH MAKE A
Line_470	NO IT ISN'T A LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A REACTION
Line_471	YES YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO RIGHT BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT INSTINCTIVE IT'S A LEARNING THING
Line_472	WE'VE BEEN DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
Line_473	SALAD IS MIXED WITH VECHETABLES
Line_474	THEY ARE MIXED WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_475	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT
Line_476	IT TAKES BETTER WHEN IT'S MIXED
Line_477	THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURES ANYMORE
Line_478	THE MARBLES ARE STUCK IN THE THING YOU HAD THE WATER WET AND THE BULB
Line_479	FOR THE SCREEN THE SAND FALLS ON THE SCREEN SO THEN THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
Line_480	THE SAND NOT GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_481	UM I CAN'T FORGOT I'M SORRY Y
Line_482	THE SALT EVAPORATES OR OR DISSOLVES
Line_483	UM MAYBE I YE I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_484	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT EVAPORATES THE WATER STILL IT STAYS A SALT WATER
Line_485	IT'S TURNING INTO A MIXTURE BUT SALT DISSOLVES AND IF IT WAS HAD SAND IN IT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO THE WATER AND THE SCREE
Line_486	S SALT OR THE SOLUTION
Line_487	YES YOU COULD PUT THE GRAPE USE BACK IN THE CAN BUT UM THE WATER WOULD JUST THE GREAT WOULD BE PURIFIED WITH WATER
Line_488	UM UH
Line_489	THERE IS MUD MADE FROM A SAND AND WATER
Line_490	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU SAID YOU N KNOW THE SOME COMING T
Line_491	IT DISSOLVES
Line_492	I LIKE TALKS
Line_493	WELL IT IS A SIUTE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER SITE IS SO PLEASE THEM WITH A SIGHT OKAY
Line_494	WHAT IS A DILUTE
Line_495	WHAT IS A SIUTE
Line_496	SALT SALT SALT INTERMELIKE
Line_497	TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU A REAL PERSON OR IT'S THAT'S JUST LIKE AN ANIMATED ROBI
Line_498	UM THE SOLUTION
Line_499	CAN YOU PLEAASE ANSWER ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_500	REPEAT THAT
Line_501	IT IS A PERFECTLY BALANCED
Line_502	WE HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THE UNIT
Line_503	OF A MIXTURE IN SOLUTION PRET
Line_504	WE HAVE NOT LEARNED A SITE MEANS YET SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT A SITE MEANS YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT T FOR ME PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A SITE IS
Line_505	IT MEANS THAT IT CREATES A SOLUTION AT THE END BECAUSE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SALTS INTO THE CUP
Line_506	A SOLUTION B
Line_507	A A MIXTURE A MIXTURE A MIXTURE
Line_508	IT'S A MIXTURE NOW BUT THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH SO DOESN'T IT CREATE A SOLUTIONS
Line_509	ITS CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_510	A A SOLUTION
Line_511	A A MIXTURE
Line_512	B I DON'T MILK
Line_513	ITS IS CREATING A MIXTURE
Line_514	THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
Line_515	IT IS THEY TURN TO CRYSTALS LIKE SALT CRYSTALS I THINK SO THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_516	CREATE A MIXTURE
Line_517	UH THE PERSON WAS MIXING IT UP
Line_518	UM I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
Line_519	M I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TIME IT TAKES TIME FOR TO EVAPORATE
Line_520	UM TODAY WE TOOK SALT CRYSTALS MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_521	BYE I
Line_522	MIXTURE'S
Line_523	SOLUTIONS ALL
Line_524	USING A SCREEN AND OR A MAGNETS OR A FUNNEL
Line_525	WHAT DID YOU SAY MARNIE
Line_526	WHAT DID YOU SAY MALE
Line_527	WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT THE MIXTURES MARNEY
Line_528	I THINK A LITTLE IMPORTIMPROPERTY OF THIS PICTURE IS MASS
Line_529	USE IT IS A MAGNET IT LOOKS LIKE A
Line_530	I WON'T ASK MEA QUESTION MARNEY
Line_531	LOOKS LIKE THE SAME EXAMPLE TO ME THE SO IT SEEMS LIKE NATIVES
Line_532	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES ARE TYPE OF GAS SIS SOME ARE SOLID AND SOME ARE LIQUIDS
Line_533	UM I THINK IT'S THE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE HE'S HAVE METAL IN IT AND MAGNET'S ATTRACTING METAL
Line_534	MARNEY WOOD IS UM LIKE WHEELS
Line_535	UM I THINK IT COULD BE SALT
Line_536	UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS PLEASE ONLY WITH THE ME
Line_537	A A SOLUTION
Line_538	UM BYE HIKING TOO
Line_539	NOT GOOD NOT GOOD AMOUNT DOING CIRWALTER DAY
Line_540	WE UM WHEAT ARE WE DO IN SCIENCE
Line_541	THERE IS THAT MOLD ON THE RIGHT CUP I DON'T KNOW THAT IT LECTUALLY GROWS
Line_542	I'M JUST JUST SAYING IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE RAIN
Line_543	THE ROCK WEIGHS EITY TWO MORE NO OH I MEAN TO USING THE ROCK WEIGHS UM EITY EIGHT MORE GRAMS THAN THE FATHER
Line_544	WHAT IS IT WHAT IS A SOLUTE
Line_545	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHS HEAVIER
Line_546	M THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_547	UM MOST CONCENTRATED IS SOLUTION TWO
Line_548	UH THAT WON'T BOOK SLIGHTLY ONE NOT
Line_549	THE MOST DILUTED LOOKS LIKES A SOLUTION THREE
Line_550	UH GOOD BYE WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN
Line_551	NOT WOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TODAY
Line_552	I DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WAS MONDAY AND LAST TIME WE DON SCIENCE WAS EITHER ON FRIDAY OR THIRSDAY SO I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_553	IT LOOKS LIKE A CORK SLOWLY ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND THE PENNY HAS SUNK TO THE BOTTOM THE WATER
Line_554	THEY FLOW AND SOME DON'T FLOW
Line_555	DON'T LAID CUTLLYDIED
Line_556	A SOLUTION B HAS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS IT UP LIKE SALT BECAUSE SALT CAN KEEP THINGS CUP
Line_557	UM YEAH I SAID I AGREE
Line_558	IT'S IT'S A
Line_559	IT COMES FIFTY YEAH IT BECOMES A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND
Line_560	UH THE BLUE ONE IS MORE DENSE SO IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE YELLOW LIQUID
Line_561	UM IT'S A VERY CONCENTRATE
Line_562	IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS OF A SALT
Line_563	THE BLUE ONE HAS THE MOST GRAMS AND THAT MAKES IT MORE D
Line_564	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE DENSE AND ONE IS WESS DENSE THE LESS DENSE ONES IS THE GREEN AND THE MORE DENSE ONE IS
Line_565	I HOW YOU'RE DOING TWO DAY
Line_566	HUH IT'S ABOUT SALT AND WATER
Line_567	Y YEAH BYE
Line_568	I NOTICED THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIN
Line_569	UM SO IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED NOW BECAUSE IT'S THREE SCOOPS OF
Line_570	IS SO THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE
Line_571	IT'S NOW CONCENTRATED EVERY TIME
Line_572	I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS
Line_573	RE YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER ME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING AND I HARD TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SO
Line_574	I CAME UP A CERIMOAM CONDUCT WATERS
Line_575	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WOULD BE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS IN THE WASHER
Line_576	A THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE WOULD BE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_577	UH THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE MOST THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS INSIDE OF THE CA
Line_578	UH BELIEVE IT WOULD BE WELLDAMUSCON
Line_579	UM IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CONSTANT
Line_580	THE ONE ON THE MIDDLE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CO
Line_581	UH IT TALKS LIKE SUBS
Line_582	UH UP SINCE THREE
Line_583	UM THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES AND DIFFERENT UM UH DIFFERENCES LIKE LIKE UM YOU CAN DESCRIBE THEM DIFFEREN
Line_584	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THE
Line_585	IT WOULD BE AN EPSOM SALT
Line_586	WAS A EPSOM SALT IT MUST BE
Line_587	WE DID A SCIENCE UH A COUPLE DAYS AGO SO I FOR I FORGOT UM
Line_588	THEY'RE MAKING CAL REACTION AND MAKING IT EXPLODE XPLOWED
Line_589	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_590	OH IT'S THE PRODUCE
Line_591	M REPEATED
Line_592	UM I THINK THE BEST ONE WOULD BE THE CALCIUM CORN BEAR
Line_593	NEMBERE
Line_594	UH IT BECOMES THE PRODUCT
Line_595	ITS LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN IT
Line_596	UM THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT UM
Line_597	THE MOUNT MOLECULS ARE DIFFERENT
Line_598	H I DON'T KNOW
Line_599	THEY AS LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_600	MIX PRODUCT OR A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_601	UM THERE ARE CHEMICALS CALLED BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLOR
Line_602	ONLY IT BUBBLES UP A
Line_603	THE PRICIPITAPE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_604	THE SODIUM IT DROPS SIDE IT DISSOLVES
Line_605	THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLECULES AND TALL
Line_606	UM IT JUST DISSOLVES
Line_607	M IT DISSOLVES LIKE OUR HELPS
Line_608	UM I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME UM AFTER THE CHEMICALS ARE PUT IN SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN
Line_609	UH IT'S MADE BUBBLY
Line_610	UH UH I DON'T THINK THE CHEMICALS WATER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WOULD BE WATER ON THE OUTSID
Line_611	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A MA UM A NEW CAM
Line_612	HEY SOMEONE IS DUMPING WATER INTO A GLASS
Line_613	UM IT'S THINGS
Line_614	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION A CURRENT
Line_615	CAUSE IS RUSTY
Line_616	THE TWO WITH GREEN LIQUID MADE THE WATER TURN GRAY
Line_617	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE BENDING A GLOW STICK THAT'S ALL
Line_618	UM THERE'S A REACTION TAKING PA
Line_619	HUH YEAH TOTALLY
Line_620	UH I WANNA SEE THAT BYE
Line_621	UH YOU'RE ADDING THE GRAPE TASTIC INTO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT BE A DIFFERENT C
Line_622	YES THERE IS I THINK
Line_623	TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS HOW THEY MIX TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_624	I'M DOING WELL TODAY MARRYGOOD
Line_625	UH IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SAY IMPORTANT DO MEAN PORTION TO THE EARTH OR LIKE TO THE EXPERIMENT
Line_626	I NOTICE THAT IT UM BLUE UP SO I THINK IT MADE ORIGIN
Line_627	I THINK THOSE CHEMICALS ARE CREATING CREATING OCCIGIN HIDRGEN BUT WE WOULDN'T PLEASE G
Line_628	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_629	IT LOOKS LIKE UM IT GETS HEAVIER WHEN YOU UM ADD MORE CHEMICALS
Line_630	WELL TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE BEES SIXTY AND SIXTY GRAMS S
Line_631	UM I THINK WEIGHT A I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_632	THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO EACH OTHER
Line_633	I THERE'S MORE NEED TO SAY I AGREE WITH YOU OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I'M DOING GOOD
Line_635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_636	THEY ARE ALL TWO OR MORE THINGS THAT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_637	SOME ARE FOOD AND SOME ARE OTHER ITEMS
Line_638	H HALF OF THEM ARE FOOD AND HALF OF THEM ARE OTHER MIXTURES
Line_639	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THEN ONE ON RIGHT OR A BUNCH OF SEPARATE ITEMS
Line_640	IT IS A MIXTURE AND WHEN WE DO IT IT WILL MAKES TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
Line_641	I WOULD CALL THESE MIXTURES
Line_642	IT GETS SORTED IT OUT INTO THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS AND THEN IT IS NOT A MIXTURE
Line_643	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED AND NOW ARE NOT A MIXTURE THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT IT'S
Line_644	THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED
Line_645	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND CREATED A SOLUTION
Line_646	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_647	A A SOLUTION
Line_648	MARNEY I CAN SEE THE PICTURE
Line_649	MARIA CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO
Line_650	NO MARNEY I DON'T KNOW THEY
Line_651	MARNEY I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE
Line_652	A A SOLUTE
Line_653	THAT NOTHING EVAPORATES OR DISAPPEARS S
Line_654	THAT NOTHING DISAPPEARS OR EVAPORATES INTO THE AIR W
Line_655	BY EVAPORATING THE LIQUIDS AND JUST LEAVING THE SOLID
Line_656	ONLY IN A MIXTURE MA NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_657	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER ALL THE WAY SO IT WAS ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
Line_658	THIS MEANS THAT THOUGH THE WATER AND THE SALT ARE THE SOLUTE OR ARE A SOLUTION
Line_659	THAT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE NOT A SOLUTION
Line_660	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ASIDE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER MEANING THAT IT WAS A SOLUTION
Line_661	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE LIQUID TO TO SEPARATE A SOLUTIONS
Line_662	IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE AND LEAVE THE SALT BE
Line_663	GOOD BYE BUT MARNEY
Line_664	I'M DOING EXLLENT AND THAT GREAT SLEEP LAST NIGHT
Line_665	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_666	YOU CAN SORT IT OUT WITH YOUR HAND
Line_667	YOU CAN USE A FUNNEL OR A SCREEN
Line_668	THERE IS A DRY MIXTURE AND A MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF ITS
Line_669	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE ROCK AND THE WATER
Line_670	WHAT'S A SEND
Line_671	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND I THINK THE SAND
Line_672	THE MAGNET PULLED THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_673	A SEE'VE AND A MAGNET
Line_674	BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS AND THE WATER SO A S CATCH THE ROCKS ON TOP WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE HOLES
Line_675	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE METAL IN THEM AND SOME MIXTURES HAVE BIG OBJECTS AND SMALL OBJECTS ON THEM
Line_676	BECAUSE THE MAGNET WOULD GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT AND LEAVE THE REST ON THERE
Line_677	I NOTICE THAT ONLY THE ROCKS WENT THROUGH THE SEE NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SMALL
Line_678	UN CLEANED FILTER BECAUSE IT'S HOLDS ARE BIG ENOUGH THAT WATER CAN GO THROUGH BUT SMALL ENOUGH THAT SAND CAN NOT
Line_679	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU WHENEVER I SEE YOU AS OF LIKE THE NEXT TIME WE DO AN EX SCIENCE EXPERIMENT TOGETHER
Line_680	A SOLUTE CHAINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_681	I THINK IT'S CALLED SOMETHING LIKE A SOLUTE TATION OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_682	CAUSE IT WILL EITHER BE DARKER OR LIGHTER
Line_683	ONE ONLY HAS TWO PURPLE CRYSTAL SHEDS AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTAL SHARKS
Line_684	ONE OF THEM HAS TWO CRYSTALS OF POWDER AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTALS OF POWDER
Line_685	I THINK THAT THIS IS TRYING TO SHOW THAT I THE MORE DILUTE THE LIGHTER AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED THE DARKER
Line_686	THERE IS MORE GRAPE DRINK POWDER AND THE DARKER ONE AND LESS GRAPE DRINK POWDER AND THE LE
Line_687	E CAN ALSO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY ADDING WATER TO IT
Line_688	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER OR NOT PUT AS MUCH WATER INTO S
Line_689	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER
Line_690	YOU CAN WEIGH EACH OF THEM IF YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AND SEE WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE AND THAT ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_691	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT WEIGHED MORE THAN TWO AND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE TWO WEIGHED MORE THAN ONE
Line_692	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME WE DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
Line_693	IT WILL FLOW
Line_694	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOAT BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE ALSO
Line_695	THE ONE THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW AND THE ONE THAT IS MORE DENSE WILL SINKS
Line_696	THE ONE THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED WILL SINKS AND THE ONE THAT IS LESS CONCENTRATED WILL FLOW
Line_697	IT WILL FLOAT INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_698	MEN
Line_699	BECAUSE THE DENSER ONE KEPT THE LIGHTER ONE WEIGHED DOWN AND ENDED UP MIXING WITH IT
Line_700	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION S ARE FLOATING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_701	BUY MARNEY I CAN WAIT TO DO MY NEXT EXPERIMENT WITH YOU
Line_702	OK GREY HOW ARE YOU
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT IS A SATURATED SOLUT
Line_704	WE NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN DISSOLVE IN A WATER OF COURSE WATER AND SOMETHING TO PUT THIS SOLID INTO THE WATER WITH
Line_705	WE PUT IN SEVERAL SCOOPS OF SALT UNTIL THE WIRE COULDN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT SO IT WAS SATURATED
Line_706	UH THERE IS SO MUCH SALT AND THE WATER THAT THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_707	AFTER THREE SCOOPS IT IT THE WATER BECAME SATURATED AND THE EPSOM SALT WENT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_708	IT'S TAKING A LOT T LONGER TO BECOME SATURATED
Line_709	IT LETS THE REST OF IT STICK TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE SHIGER IS ADDING YOU CAN A
Line_710	THE I TOOK LONGER TO BE TO SATURATE THE THAN CITRIC ACID
Line_711	THE WATER IS RISING AS WE PUT IN MORE SALTS
Line_712	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_713	UM DOING THE READY FOR SCIENCE HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_714	WHEN YOU MIXED THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT STARTED FLING UP
Line_715	WE ARE GOING TO MIX MORE ONE OF- MORE THAN ONE OF THESE WITH WATER
Line_716	REACTIONS AND PRODUCTS S
Line_717	VINEGAR OR UH WATER
Line_718	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT SO THEY CHEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_719	THE REACTING MOLECULES WHEN MIXED CHEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_720	BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER
Line_721	THERE UM TWO PURPLE MOLECULES AND A LOT OF STEEL WATERS MOLECULES
Line_722	NO BECAUSE THEY HAVE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND BASICALLY CREATED ONE UM SUBSTANCE
Line_723	THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FLING UP
Line_724	THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FILLING UP WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO THE CUPS
Line_725	THE GREEN SUBSTANCE WENT INTO THE WATER AND TURNED ALL THE WATER GREW
Line_726	I MEAN A CHEMICAL REACTION IS CURRENT BECAUSE THE WATER IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE RING SUBSTANCES
Line_727	THE SUBSTANCE ON THE INCE THEIR GLOW STICKS TIL
Line_728	THE WATER CHEMICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THE GRAPES THAT IT THE CA STICK IS MIXED WITH IT
Line_729	NO BECAUSE THE GRAPES THE TA STICK IS JUST GOING INTO THE WATER NOT REALLY CHEMICAL CHANGE IT
Line_730	BYE I HOPE TO SEE YOU LATER WHEN I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MORE SCIENCE
Line_731	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_732	I SEE IT'S CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER FOR THE REACTANT TO CREATE A NEW SUBSTITUTE
Line_733	I SAW A NEW PRODUCT AT THE BOTTOM I
Line_734	THEY MADE IT FILL UP AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
Line_735	EN THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL CHANGE
Line_736	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOOSE
Line_737	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOSS
Line_738	THE BAG THAT WAS OPEN LET OUT THE GAS THAT IS CREATED AND THE BAG THAT IS CLOSED KEPT THE GAS AND MAKING IT WEIGH MORE
Line_739	THE OPEN BAG IS LOWER OR IT'S WEIGHS LESS THAN THE CLOSED BAG
Line_740	BECAUSE THE OPEN BAG LEFT OUT LET THE GAS GO OUT AND THE CAUSE BACK DIDN'T
Line_741	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_742	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES OR DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_743	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS IN THEM
Line_744	THES- HAS THE SALAD
Line_745	IT HAS EVERYTHING IN IT THAT MAKES IT A MAKES
Line_746	IT IS CALLED A MIXTURE WHEN ONE OR MORE TWO OR MORE THINGS ARE COMPARED T
Line_747	A MIXTURE
Line_748	IT IS NOT COMPARED AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IT IS COOLER
Line_749	THEY WERE TAKING OUT OF THEIR M
Line_750	THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURE AND NOT KEPT TOGETHER ANY
Line_751	THEY WERE TAKING OUT OF THEIR MIXTURES AND NOT KEPT TOGETH-
Line_752	WHEN TRYING TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE SCREEN THEY WERE NOT PUT IN BECAUSE THEY ARE TO BIG
Line_753	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THEM FROM THE WATER
Line_754	SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE SAND AND WATER
Line_755	THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER INTO A MIXTURE AND THEN SEPARATED
Line_756	IT BECAME A A MIXTURE AND THEN WAS SEPARATED
Line_757	WHEN IT DISSOLVES IT BECOMES PARTS OF THE OTHER MIXTURE IT CREATES ONE BIG SOLID
Line_758	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_759	MORE ROLES THAT THEY HAVE IN CREATING THE SOLUTION IS WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE DISSOLVES
Line_760	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_761	THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WAS DISSOLVED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THE SALT WAS TOOKEN BY THE WATER AND SAL
Line_762	A DISSOLVATION
Line_763	NO I DO NOT THINK SO BECAUSE IF AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND S
Line_764	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SALT AND WATER BEING MIXTURES AND D
Line_765	THAT WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER TOGETHER IT JUST MIXES BROWN MUD WATER AND WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER TOGETHER IT MAKES A CLEAR SOLID AND A LIQUID
Line_766	WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SALT IS THAT WHEN THE SAND AND WATER WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A A MIXTURE IT WAS DISSOLVED
Line_767	I THINK THAT THE WATER AND THE SOLUTION IS PLAYING THE LIQUID BECAUSE THE GRAPE TASTIC IS SOLID
Line_768	I THINK THAT IT IS CALLED DISSOLVENT
Line_769	I THINK THE SOLUTE IS THE SALTS IN THIS MIXTURE AND ITS POSITION IS THE SOLID IN THIS P
Line_770	WE CALL THE THING THAT IS THE DISSOLVING DISSOLVENT
Line_771	THE MASS OF THE STUFF GOING ON D GRAM
Line_772	THE MASS IS CREATING A LARGER AMOUNT BECAUSE OF MORE MIXTURE IS BEING BROUGHT INTO
Line_773	MARNEY THIS DOESN'T MAKE S
Line_774	WHAT IS THE TERM ARMY
Line_775	MARNE I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_776	WHAT'S UP AT THIS REPEAT
Line_777	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND IT BECAME A MIXTURE SOLUTION
Line_778	WHEAT IS THIS OBJECT MORNING
Line_779	MARNIE I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_780	WELL MARNEY THE WATER IS DISAPPEARING FROM EACH DISH BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING THE SALT IS SHRINKING INTO THE WATER
Line_781	MARNEY WHAT IS DICIPRATING MEAN
Line_782	MORNEY CAN USE SUMAN ON THE PICTURE PLEASED
Line_783	MARNEY CAN WE GO OVER THIS HOLE CHEST AGAIN
Line_784	YOU TOO MARNEY HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU'RE MY BEST FORE
Line_785	ONE WAY WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE IS USING A SCREEN ANOTHER IS MAKING A FUNNEL
Line_786	A MIXTURE IS A MIX SOMETHING OF TWO OR MORE OBJECTS MIX TOGETHER MAKING A COMBONATI
Line_787	THE OBJECT AND WATER IS BEING SEPARATED FROM WITH FROM THE SCREW
Line_788	MARNE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MISS
Line_789	MONEY WHEAT IS A PROPERTY
Line_790	WE WANT ABOUT USING A MAGNET IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAGNET USES MAGNETISM TO GET THE MAGNETS
Line_791	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_792	MARNE I CAN NOT SEE THE PICTURE
Line_793	WHAT IS A THEE VE
Line_794	BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM WOULDN'T BE AS STRONG
Line_795	I THINK WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FROM DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE IT HELPS FOR DIFFERENT PROP
Line_796	I THINK WE USED A MAGNET BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAN ONE WON'T BE ABLE TO ST
Line_797	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL SEPARATED FROM FROM THE SAND BECAUSE IT IS A BIGGER OBJECT OBJECT AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE WHOLE
Line_798	I I THINK WE USED A FILTER SO THAT THE WATER COULD GO THROUGH AND THE SAND DID NOT
Line_799	YEARS YEAH
Line_800	I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WENT ON AND SEPARATING THEM THROUGH THE MIX
Line_801	I MY BEST FRIEND BY MARNEY MARNEY CAN YOU KEEP TALKING TO ME
Line_802	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DILUTE AND CONCITRATE LIQUIDS THAT HAVE BEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_803	WELL TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MIXTURE AND THEN SOMEHOW SEPARATE THE MIXTURES
Line_804	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_805	THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_806	BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS THE CONCENTRATED ONES
Line_807	IT WOULD TASTE NOT AS STRONG IT A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND
Line_808	B ADDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
Line_809	BY ADDING MORE WATER TO A A DIFFERENT CUP
Line_810	BECAUSE YOU COULD ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF WATER AND THEN DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_811	THE AND THE PURPLE AND THE BLUE ONES CUP IS CONCENTRATED AND ONE IS DILUTED
Line_812	I CAN SEE THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO CUPS OF SALT WATER SOLUTION THAT ONE HAS TEN GRAMS SOLUTE AND THE OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SALT
Line_813	THE ONE OF TWENTY GRAMS SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE THING GRAMS BECAUSE IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS
Line_814	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_815	BECAUSE OF THE TWENTY GRAMS AND THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE BEING COMPARED WILL BE THE TWENTY GRAMS BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IS TEN MORE GRAMS SO T
Line_816	I THINK WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE AMOUNT THE MASS AND SOLUTE IS THAT THE MASS IS GREATER IN EXPERIMENT THAN THIS
Line_817	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_818	SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED SOLUTION ONE
Line_819	SOLUTION ONE IS SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATING SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTR
Line_820	SOLUTION THREE SOLUTION ONE IS THAT MOST COME STRATINTO THE SOLUTION THREE THE LEAST CONFORT
Line_821	SOLUTION A FIRST SOLUTION
Line_822	IF SOMETHING IS MORE DENSE WE DROP INTO THE CHUNK IT WILL FLOW ALL THE WEIGH TO THE BOTTOM
Line_823	I THINK THIS MEANS SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT SOLUTION A DOES NOT
Line_824	WELL IT WOULD DEPEND ON IF IT HAS SALT OR NO
Line_825	THEY DID NOT BLAH THEY DID NOT BLAH AND THEY DO NOT LUNG
Line_826	I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT SINCE THEY'RE NOT BLENDING IT'S CAUSING A FORM OF CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION
Line_827	IT WOULD NOT BENT AND IT WOULD LOOK CON FROM CONCENTRATED TO DILUTION
Line_828	NOT BENDING
Line_829	SOME ONE EITHER ADDED TO MA PRESSURE OR YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EACH
Line_830	IT IS A DIFFERENCE OR TEN GRAMS OF SALT
Line_831	I NOTICED THAT BLUE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IT AND THEN RED IS A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND THEN GREEN
Line_832	THAT THE BLUE HAS TELEGRAM SO THIS THE HEAVIEST SO THIS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS THE SECOND CONCENTRATED AND THEN GREEN IS THE MOST DILUTE
Line_833	BECAUSE THE BLUE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND GREEN ITS THE LIGHT
Line_834	YELLOW CORNDL
Line_835	IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE FOR SCOOPS IS MORE AND THE THREE SCOOPS MAKES IT MORE
Line_836	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN DILU
Line_837	WELL IT DID NOT DISSOLVE ALL THE WEIGHTS
Line_838	WE I THINK EAGLES AND TWO THIRTY SIX FORTY EIGHT TWELVE SPIN SPAN THREE IS THE TWENTIES ONE AND THEN UM THIRTY SIX I MEAN SOME THAT'S ONE AND AND SO
Line_839	TH SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST LEADING AND
Line_840	TE CRYSTALS GO AWAY
Line_841	WELL THE CRYSTALS WOULD NOT MAKES CLEAR
Line_842	WELL THEY GO CLEARLY TO THE DITCH AND DON'T COME OUT
Line_843	CULT CRYSTALS WOULD BE THE MOST UM DENSITY
Line_844	HE WED THE HAND
Line_845	WELL EVAPORATED TOGETHER AND MAKING IT ALL MIXTURES THE REAL PRODUCTION
Line_846	IT IS A PRODUCT CAN BYE TEGREE
Line_847	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_848	IT MAKES IT A SALT CRYSTAL WEIGH THERE'S A STARTED OUT OF
Line_849	PRECIPITATION IS HAPPENING AND IT MAKES ITS MOIING AND A SATURATE THE SOLVENTS IN TO PRICIPIT
Line_850	AND THEN YOU MAKE THE PACIPITATION GO
Line_851	ORAN SCIENDS WELL IT HANDS OVER AND IT MAKES PARTICIPITATION
Line_852	WELL AS YOU SHAKE IN MOISING THE BAG THE PERSON'S HAND IT'S MAKING FORCIPITATE MORE
Line_853	THE CHEMICAL ACTION CURVED BECAUSE THE PROTIPITATION HAPPENED AND IT WENT DOWN THE CHAN
Line_854	THE MAGNET IS BRINGING THE PAPER CLIP A RIVER GO
Line_855	THE MAGNET IS MOVING AROUND AND THE THE PAPER CLIP IS STICKING
Line_856	IT'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_857	MAGNETS
Line_858	WHEN IT WENT UP TO NINETEEN IT STOPPED T IT WENT DOWN
Line_859	THE WHEN I WENT UP TO NINETEEN AGAIN THE THE MAGNETS WERE ATTRACTING AT FIRST BUT THEN IT STOOD OF REPELLING TO
Line_860	IT GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER BECAUSE THE IS MORE WASHERS THAN THE MAGNET
Line_861	IT GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER EACH TIME YOU ADD SOMETHING
Line_862	WHEN I ADDED THE WASHER IT GOT SEPARATE MAGNETS SEPARATED FROM ME
Line_863	I'S JUST ONE ADDING AND ADDING AND ADDIN
Line_864	NORTH AND SOUTH CAN CAN BE TOGETHER AND SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH OR
Line_865	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRIC
Line_866	WELL YOU D YOU PUT THE BATTERY TO THE WITH THE BATTERY
Line_867	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_868	THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_869	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND COMING BACK AROUND AND AROUND
Line_870	MOTOR IS MOVING IT'S TO MAKE THE ENERGY IS COMING BACK AGAIN
Line_871	BECAUSE MEAN METAL TO TOUCH TO FOR ENERGY TO TO WORK FOR ANY OTHERS ENERGY
Line_872	IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE THE ENERGY IS TRAPPED
Line_873	FOR THE SWITCH TO A CLOSED
Line_874	NO THINGS AT BEAN
Line_875	FOR THE FOR THE SWITCHER TO TURN TO CLOSE D
Line_876	IT DOESN'T WORK THEN ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_877	THE SUN LIGHT IS MAKING IT'S LIKE A CALCULATOR MAKING IT WORK BY THE SUN
Line_878	WE HAVE FOR THE MOMENT TO RUN IT'S TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN WORK
Line_879	F FOR THE SUNLIGHT TO SHINE ON THE THING
Line_880	OR THE SUN FOR HIS SON FOR THE MOTOR TO WORK SO HE CAN WORK
Line_881	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK SO- IT WON'T WORK
Line_882	NO MEAN NOT
Line_883	IT TURNS THE MOTOR ON
Line_884	IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT FOR THE ENERGY TO WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_885	THE SUN MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_886	THAT'S NOT MOVING ANY MORE
Line_887	THE ENERGY ITS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR ANYMORE
Line_888	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING IS THE BATTERY MAKEING THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE D CELL IS FROM THE WIRE
Line_889	THINK YOU- A LOT
Line_890	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_891	WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IT'S ENERGY
Line_892	THE SNAIL IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_893	UM
Line_894	AN CONDUCTOR MAKES ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_895	IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POPSICLE STICK
Line_896	NDATIVE IS PLASTIC SO
Line_897	THAT ELECTRICITY IS E ENERGY
Line_898	UM BECAUSE A CONDUCTING IS NOT FLOWING
Line_899	IT'S NOT SPINNING I STILL
Line_900	I NOTICE ABOUT THE PAPER CLIP THAT IS MAKING THE ENERGY FLOWS
Line_901	I I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_902	WE WERE WE'VE BEEN DOING MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS TO WORK AT SAME T
Line_903	YE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRODUCES LIGHT
Line_904	I SEE A CANDLE PRODUCING A HEAT ENERGY
Line_905	IT GETS IT COMES WAX OFF WAX IT COMES OFF AND THE IT HAS TO HEAT FOR HEAT IT
Line_906	IT MAKES IT'S BECAUSE IT THE HEAT
Line_907	THE WAX
Line_908	NO END OF
Line_909	IT'S SOUNDED LIKE NOTHING
Line_910	I SEE THE WAX MELTING AND THE FIRE BURNING
Line_911	IT IN IT HAS A COLOR THAT WE CAN SEE
Line_912	BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_913	IT PRODUCES A SOUND ENERGY
Line_914	YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND WHEN THE STICK IS BANGING ON THE RUB
Line_915	A GIRL IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_916	HI REPEAT THAT
Line_917	BY EATING THE HEALTHY SNACK LIKE AN APPLE OR BANANOS OR GRAPE
Line_918	I SEE A FELT BLOCKS A BRANCH CANDLE APPLES AND A CABINET
Line_919	IT'S HEATING UP TO TURNS TO FIRE
Line_920	IT IS MAKING IT MOVE S
Line_921	ITS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_922	UHM IT IT'S MAKING IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_923	I DON'T KNOW
Line_924	IS THE SOLAR PANEL CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE AND THE ONE THING YOU CAN MAKE STUFF MOVE TO
Line_925	THAT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_926	ENERGY UH
Line_927	IMPORTANT BYE MAKES STUFF IN THE MOVEMENT
Line_928	BUILDING CIRCUITS CARS UH NO I DON'T KNOW
Line_929	IT MAKES WELL HOW IT THING TODAY
Line_930	VE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_931	CIRCUIT IS ABOUT CHANGED THE FIND
Line_932	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_933	S SO THEY CAN ALL LIGHT UP SO IT CAN MAKE ALL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_934	UM IT'S MAKING IT LIGHT UP BY A LIGHT BULB I MEAN THATTERY EXPAND
Line_935	THE D CELLS ARE GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS TO WORK
Line_936	THOSE ARE D CELLS THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_937	BY E MAKING THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_938	IT'S TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_939	BY CONNECTING TO THE-
Line_940	I GOT THAT T
Line_941	THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS IN THE M
Line_942	SAY WELL NOT WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ONE BATTERY AND THERE'S LIKE FIFTEEN OF THEM LIKE BULB'S
Line_943	UM THAT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTER
Line_944	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_945	UM BECAUSE THERE'S THE TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER OH NO
Line_946	UM THE BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK TO CREA ENERGY
Line_947	THAT THEY ARE NOT WORKING AS
Line_948	A ENERGY
Line_949	IT HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_950	THE BOTH LIGHT BULB ARE LIGHTING
Line_951	THE BATTERY IS MAKING TWO BULBS WORKS
Line_952	THE BULBS ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_953	UM IT'LL GET MORE BRIGHTER
Line_954	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_955	ELECTRICITY COMES FROM A BATTERY
Line_956	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY GOING AROUND AND AROUND IT FROM THE LIGHT BULB'S
Line_957	THE MINE OF THEM IN THIS PICTURE IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_958	THAT THEY ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_959	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_960	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SIDES
Line_961	IT'S FLOWING BY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_962	CUT THE ENERGY BY THE BLUE LIGHT BULBS AND THE WOULD THE WIRES
Line_963	I NOTICE THAT LIGHT BULBS WON'T LIGHT ENO IT THE WIRE
Line_964	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I FORGOT
Line_965	M WITH TWO BATTERIES IT CAN MAKE IT BRIGHTER
Line_966	YES
Line_967	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MORE BRIGHTER
Line_968	BYE MAKE IT JU LIGHT BUT WORK
Line_969	THE SECONDS ONE
Line_970	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_971	NOT SO MUCH H
Line_972	IT SHOWS THE LIGHT YUP
Line_973	IT HAS MAGNETS FORCE IN THEM
Line_974	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_975	BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL
Line_976	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_977	BECAUSE IT IS A METAL IRON OR STEEL
Line_978	YES BECAUSE IT IS METAL I TOLD YOU THAT
Line_979	I DON'T LIKE DO
Line_980	BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE IRON IN THEM
Line_981	MORE I MORE METAL STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_982	OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR POR FORCE FOR IT SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_983	SOME METALS OR MAGNETS CAN STICK SO IT CAN WORK
Line_984	I IRON
Line_985	IRON CAN STICK TO METAL BECAUSE IT HAS NO MAGNETS AND THE
Line_986	THE ONE THAT'S NOT ALUMINIUM BECAUSE THAT HAS MORE FORCE THAN IN AND THAT WON'T THINK IT'S METAL
Line_987	SO THE ROCK THE RING AND THE ALUMIN- NAIL CAN'T STICK
Line_988	UH IT WON'T WORK BUT IT HAS NO METAL OR IT IN IT
Line_989	THAT THE GREY ROCKS DOESN'T STICK
Line_990	THAT IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO METAL IN IT OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_991	STICK CAUSE IT HAS MEAT IT'S METAL
Line_992	IT'S WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT SO LIKE LITTLE STUFF AND THE
Line_993	B BECAUSE IT HAS METAL INSIDE IT
Line_994	I IRON METAL STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_995	TALKING ABOUT STUFF THAT CAN STICK TO METAL AND STUFF THAT CAN'T STICK TO METAL
Line_996	ONE IS WIRES TWO WIRES A BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_997	THEY GIVE OUT ENERGY FOR ST
Line_998	SOURCES IS ANOTHER WAY FOR SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU YES
Line_999	UM WHAT THEY THEY DO IS WE GIVE MORE ENERGY KIND OF
Line_1000	I THINK IT'S A PATHWAY BECAUSE IT'S GOING LIKE A PATH BECAUSE IT'S SO LIKE THIN A PATH THEN
Line_1001	LIGHT BULBS ARE ER SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU LIGHT
Line_1002	THEY HELP YOU SEE AND MAINLY PLACES
Line_1003	A RECEIVER IS ANOTHER WORD FOR LIGHT BULB
Line_1004	THAT MEANS THAT HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER THAT THEY DID VERY GOOD AND THAT THEY MADE LIGHT
Line_1005	ROLE I ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE IS ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1006	IT KIND OF DEPENDS
Line_1007	UM WHERE THERE IS A MINE SINCE
Line_1008	WELL THERE IS A RED ON THAT SIDE AND THERE IS A FLAT SIDE ON THAT SIDE
Line_1009	THAT THE BATTERY TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S DOING THE UPPER THING
Line_1010	NO IT IS THE MINUS SCIENCE IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE BATTERY YOU GET
Line_1011	I AM SORRY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1012	E ARE NOT CONNECTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND MAKE LIGHT WITH THAT
Line_1013	IT WILL NOT CARRY ENERGY NOR BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1014	WELL KAY BYE YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO ME I HOPE I SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1015	A LITTLE FLAG IS SHORT MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1016	IF THE FLAG IS MADE THING THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1017	IT NEEDS ENERGY FOR IT TO RUN OUR GASOLINE
Line_1018	THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY AND ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT ONTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1019	IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT TURNS T
Line_1020	IT TURNS ON ONCE YOU TURN ON THE SWITCH
Line_1021	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1022	RESTS SLOWLY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1023	IT'S THE F LIE COLDN'T MOVE
Line_1024	NO BECAUSE IF THE TOY DAY IS BLOCKING THE SUN
Line_1025	IT'S HOWDY THE B FLAG STOPS
Line_1026	HE IS MOVING AND WORKING
Line_1027	WHEN THE SUN GETS TO THE MOTOR IT'S THRIFT'S TO MA
Line_1028	A NEVA A FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1029	BE CAUSE IT'S METAL AND METAL I THINK HAS ENERGY
Line_1030	WELL USUALLY MAKES THE MOTOR WORK IS NOT ALL NO NOTHING ELSE TO MAJOR
Line_1031	TH USUALLY A NAIL
Line_1032	NO THINGS REALLY HAPPENING AND SIDE AND A
Line_1033	USUALLY AN INSULATOR IS METAL AND THE CONDUCTOR IS USUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
Line_1034	IN THE LITERS ARE DIRLY NOT METAL YEAH SO GEAH
Line_1035	O IT STAIRS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1036	THEY UM THEY DON'T PART COLLECT THE
Line_1037	WELL CONDUCTORS ARE UM SOMETHING METAL USUALLY
Line_1038	A
Line_1039	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TWICE AND ONE CIRCUIT
Line_1040	BECAUSE BOUT WITHOUT ENERGY WE COULDN'T BE MOVING
Line_1041	YOU IF THEY FIELD WHEAT
Line_1042	THE SHEET IS PROBABLY GLOWING AND GIVING US ENERGY
Line_1043	YES I HEAR FLAMES BURNING
Line_1044	IT SOUND THAT KIND OF LIKE AH SOUND
Line_1045	FIRE OR THE FLAME IS MAREN SUCH SIDE
Line_1046	IT TAKES THE BIG THUMB
Line_1047	BECAUSE ENERGY IS YOU'RE LIGHTER WHEN YOU MOVE
Line_1048	IT MAKES ALLOWED SOUND AND YOU'RE WASTING OUR ENERGY
Line_1049	WE HEAR A LOUD SOUND
Line_1050	THE GIRL IS USING HER ENERGY TO WALK
Line_1051	BY FIELD AND APPLES FRIELDS SWETCHED THE BOLTS
Line_1052	HERE IT WOULD CAUSE A FLAME
Line_1053	YOU SEE KIND OF LIKE A GREY SEA AND LIKE A GREY CLOUD GOING UP
Line_1054	I WENT T
Line_1055	THE YOU GET ENERGY BY THE SAME THING
Line_1056	ITTHEY'RE ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1057	BEAM IT WOULD CURRENT IF SHOE EXCLAMED
Line_1058	BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH DIFFERENT AND ENERGY THEY GET ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1059	YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH THE WET
Line_1060	EVEN TRYING TO LIGHT UP TOO LIGHT BULB
Line_1061	THE CIRCUIT MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT HELPS MORE INSTEAD OF USING OUR HANDS
Line_1062	TO GET HELPS IT B UH HELPS THE LIGHT B LIGHT UP
Line_1063	THAT THE SAME THING JUST TO TWIST IT IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE UM MATERIALS THE CIRCUIT HOLD
Line_1064	PAS SWAY
Line_1065	THE BLUE DULITS ARE THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_1066	WE THINK OF A LITTLE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND TO COME OUT LIKE A CAVE
Line_1067	WELL YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEY START TO LIGHT UP MORE AND MORE
Line_1068	MAYBE MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO BE CIRCLE WEIGHT TO FOR IT TO LIGHT UP
Line_1069	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD HOW ARE DO
Line_1070	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH THE BATTERIES
Line_1071	THEY ARE ALL KINDS OF MAGNETS FIRST IT'S A DON MAGNET THEN IT'S A HORSCHO MAGNET AND THEN IT'S JUST A REGULAR MAGNET
Line_1072	WELL THEY CARRIE ENERGY INSIDE OF IT AND STICK TO ANYTHING STEEL AND THEY
Line_1073	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1074	YES BECAUSE THE WHOLE ENTIRE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL SO THE STEEL STICKS TO ANYTHING MAGNETIC
Line_1075	IT'S LIKE PROBABLY LIKE LITTLE TINY MAGNETS BECAUSE SHE MAGNETS TICK TOGETHER
Line_1076	THE NAIL STICKS ILL MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL THE OTHER ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL SO IT WON'T BE ABLE TO STICK
Line_1077	ONLY GOOD TICKS I NEVER KNEW THAT WEILL I JUST LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TO NEW
Line_1078	UM STEEL THAT'S FOR HER A STEEL
Line_1079	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1080	THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1081	WHEN THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BATTERY AND ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB THEY MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1082	THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE ENERGY THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB GO ON AND THE WIRES THAT HITS IT
Line_1083	IT HELPS ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S KIND LIKE THE BATTERY FOR THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1084	IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE
Line_1085	THEY ARE A PATH WAY FROM THE BATTERY WHICH IS THE SOURCE ENERGY SOURCE AND TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_1086	ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
Line_1087	THEY CARRY ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY SO THAT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1088	THE LIGHT BULB THERE UM IS FOR THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY SO THEY WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1089	IN THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE FILAMENT AND THE FILAMENT M HELPS IT LIGHT UP
Line_1090	IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY
Line_1091	THEN IT DOES THIS I THINK THERE IS ELECTRICITY SO THEN WE CAN HAVE LIGHT
Line_1092	THE A ELECTRICITY
Line_1093	THE NEGATIVE OR THE THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_1094	IT COMES TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES TOWARDS THE WIRES AND COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE BATTERY
Line_1095	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1096	THE ELECT LITTLE ELECTRICITY BLUE DOTS ARE GOING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_1097	IS TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY STARTED FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1098	IT GOES BACK THE WAY THAT IT STARTED
Line_1099	IT MIGHT GO FASTER OR THEY WOULD BOTH HIT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT MIGHT LIGHT UP OR IT MIGHT NOT T
Line_1100	WHEN THEY'RE ON ONES ON THE SIDE AND ONES ON THE BOTTOM IT WORKS BUT WHEN THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1101	THE MOTOR A FLAT THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1102	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1103	IT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND IT'S THE ENERGY IS MAKING IT MOVED
Line_1104	IT IS THE ENERGY AND IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CAR YOU MEAN THE BATTERY OR THE CAR FOR IT TO WORK
Line_1105	IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE ONE SIDE WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND THAT'S WHY THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING
Line_1106	THE FIVE NO THE MOTOR STARTS WORKING SO THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING IT WON'T WORK
Line_1107	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING WHAT IS LIKES CLOSED
Line_1108	SOLAR THING IS MAKES SOME THINGS WORK
Line_1109	IF THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEN THERE IS NO ENERGY COMING DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO MAKE FIRE
Line_1110	IT WOULDN'T WORK WE WERE GONNA DO THAT TO DAY ALSO BUT IT WAS LADY DAYS SO IT DIDN'T WORK IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK
Line_1111	IT MAKES THE SOLAR PANEL HAVE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR YOU SHOWED ME THIS BEFORE IN THE CA
Line_1112	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1113	YOU TO BYE MARNIE
Line_1114	GOOD HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU M MARNEY
Line_1115	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND IN CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_1116	I SEE THAT THE GENERATOR FLAG ISN'T MOVING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TURNED LIKE TO WHERE IT IT WOULD BE A
Line_1117	I MAKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT IT WORKS BRIGHT
Line_1118	OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DON'T WORK
Line_1119	BYE MARNEY THANKS FOR THE TUTORING BE
Line_1120	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY
Line_1121	THIS IS THE CANDLE AND IT'S LIKE THE WARM FLAMATED A HANDROWBANK
Line_1122	THE HEAT IS MAKING THE IT'S SO HOT IT MAKES THE WAX MELT IT'S LIKE THE CURRENT WHEN YOU GO IT BURNS OFF THE GASSY
Line_1123	I FLING WHEN I WENT BY IT OR LIKE CAN SEE IT'S IT'S LIKE HOT
Line_1124	THAT THE GRASS OR THE WAX IS LIKE GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE HEAT IS LIKE MAKING IT SO HOT THAT THE WAX
Line_1125	M LIGHT
Line_1126	THERE WAS NO SOUND THE- THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AT ALL
Line_1127	A PERSON IS BANGING ON DRUMS
Line_1128	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE IS EATING FOOD HE IS EATING THE APPLE
Line_1129	IT IS MAKING SOUNDS
Line_1130	I SEE WOOD FOUL LIKE GRASS A LAND I SEE A CANDLE AND THREE APPLES
Line_1131	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP BOTH LIKE THE WIRE AND THE BATTERY
Line_1132	IT'S ALL CONNECTED
Line_1133	ALL UM THE ELECTRICITY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1134	THE WHAT'S WHY DO YOU SAY
Line_1135	O M ONE THE CIRCUIT IS THE WHOLE THING CONNECTED AND THE PATHWAYS ARE THE WIRES
Line_1136	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE
Line_1137	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS IN LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING IN THE LA
Line_1138	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE A LITTLE ENERGY AND THE ENERGY
Line_1139	OKAY I DID THAT MARNEY NO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME A
Line_1140	USUALLY ONCE OR TWO OR MORE
Line_1141	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND LIGHT
Line_1142	WHEN YOU TAKE BATTERY AWAY IT'S THEN LIGHT BULBS AREN'T AS BRIGHT
Line_1143	IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
Line_1144	YOU ON THE ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS AREN'T BRIGHT AT ALL BUT ON THE TWO D CELL THE BRIGHT THE LIGHTS ARE REALLY REALLY GREAT
Line_1145	YES AND WELL IT LIKE WHEN YOU ADD IN ANOTHER D CELL THE LIGHTS THE BULBS OR LIGHTS GOT VERY
Line_1146	WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1147	IT HAS A LIKE IT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_1148	I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THE WIRES
Line_1149	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE
Line_1150	THE PATHWAYS IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1151	THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND IT MOVES LIKE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1152	EH THE PATHWAY OR THE WIRES OR BOTH THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
Line_1153	BLOW DOTS ARE THE LITTLE DOT OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1154	ELECTRICITY IS GOING LIKE THROUGH THE LIKE LITTLE PIECES OF ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING
Line_1155	E WILL HAVE TO ADD MORE COMPONENTS LIKE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE WIRES
Line_1156	IF WE HAD MORE THAN ONE D CELL THE BULBS WILL LIGHT THEM BRIGHTER
Line_1157	I SEE THAT SOME OTHER TIME THE BULB GETS TAKEN AWAY IT'S DIFFERENT
Line_1158	WITH TWO D CELLS IT GOES BRIGHTER BUT ONCE THE ONE LIGHT BULB GETS TAKING AWAY THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS DOESN'T WORK
Line_1159	BECAUSE IT'S THEN BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND OUT THE POSITIVE
Line_1160	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1161	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY
Line_1163	I I SEE TWO TWO BULBS AND ONE D CELL
Line_1164	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1165	THE LIGHTS WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE L A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT OR NOT BRIGHT
Line_1166	I JUST TOLD YOU
Line_1167	MAYBE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT'S
Line_1168	REPEAT PLEASE
Line_1169	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1170	THERE ARE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND WIRE
Line_1171	A D CELL BATTERY
Line_1172	THEY'RE ALL ABOUT HOW THEY THEY POWDER EVERYTHING I DON'T I THINK
Line_1173	IT MEAN THAT IT POWERS MOSTLY EVERYTHING
Line_1174	POWER ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SOURCE
Line_1175	LIGHT BULBS UM HELP LIGHT COME INTO THE RUMITIC
Line_1176	IT MEANS THAT IT POWERS A LIGHT BULB FOR THE R UM TO GET LIGHTER
Line_1177	IT'S GOING UP AND DOWN AND UNDER
Line_1178	THE BOTTOM ONE WHICH IS PRRINGING THE POWER AGAIN THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_1179	THE- PREVENT THE POWER ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1180	I NOTICED IT SWITCHED AROUND SO IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW
Line_1181	IT GOES BACKWARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT WAS GOING BEFORE
Line_1182	IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY ROUNDS
Line_1183	THAT IT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERY THING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED A DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1184	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1185	I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TWO BREAK THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1186	LEARNING HOW TO POWER MOTO POWERS A MOTOR
Line_1187	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO POWER THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG SIT
Line_1188	FOR ELECTRICITY OR POWER TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR FOR THE FLAG TO T
Line_1189	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1190	THE WIRES ARE COMING OUT A D CELL TO THE MOTOR AND THERE IS ALSO A SWITCH
Line_1191	IT IT GETS THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE BAT THE MOTOR WORK
Line_1192	THE FLAT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO D CELL IT TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1193	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE MIDDLE
Line_1194	WHEN THE SWITCH IS ITS NOT ON THE METAL IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S ON THE METAL THE FLAG STARTS SPIN
Line_1195	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING
Line_1196	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THAT TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING FLAGS SPIN
Line_1197	FORM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO TO FROM THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_1198	POWER GOT TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE POWER AND THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG

Line_1201	THE HEAT FROM THE CANDLE IS MELTING THE CANDLE
Line_1202	ITS SPURNING THE CAN
Line_1203	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED UM TO HAVE LIGHTS IN EVERYTHING
Line_1204	CHEANCHEAN I
Line_1205	I CAN SEE SHEET THE ENERGY FIRE AND THE CANDLE WAS MELT TO
Line_1206	A SOUND ENERGY
Line_1207	I CAN TELL BECAUSE KEEP ON NEEDS ENERGY TO WALK RUN AND SIT
Line_1208	ENERGY MAKES YOU WALK AND RUN IN SLEEP AND YOU CAN TELL SHE HAS ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_1209	BY EATING AND DRINKING SO WA
Line_1210	THE MOTOR AND THE FLAG WILL T
Line_1211	AH I DON'T KNOW
Line_1212	I I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME
Line_1213	I I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW YEAH CAN YOU LEAST TELL ME PLEASE MARNEY
Line_1214	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT MUCH SCIENCE
Line_1215	IT'S A CANDLE AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING SCIENCE RIGHT
Line_1216	IT'S THE MELTING I YEAH IT'S MELTING
Line_1217	NO BECAUSE I NEVER TOUCHED FIRE NOT WOULD BE VERY STUPID AND YEAH YOU'RE QUITE IN ER CREEP
Line_1218	IT HAS ENERGY
Line_1219	IT'S HOW LIKE THE
Line_1220	IT'S FLAMING
Line_1221	SOUND ENERGY FROM THE PERSON A'S BULKY THE BUN GOES AND MAKE THEM STOP
Line_1222	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME
Line_1223	THERE IS ALL FOUL THERE IS A GIRL WALKING AN APPLE WITH A STICK THAT AC PAT SHE LOOKS VERY CREEP

Line_1237	USING MAGNETIC YOU AS A MAGNET A NOISE
Line_1238	IT CIRCUITS ABOUT A FULL C
Line_1239	UP
Line_1240	ELECTRICITY DOES INVOLVES CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY MAKES A CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1241	FOR ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE CIRCU-
Line_1242	IT FLOWS BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ON THE WIRES NEGATIVE SIDE MAKE IN IT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1243	THE BLUE DOTS IS ELECTRIC
Line_1244	THEY WERE TO BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND THE ELECTRICITY WON'T
Line_1245	THEY WON'T GLOW POSSIBLY
Line_1246	IT'S AFFECT IT BY IT WILL GET MAYBE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THE MORE D CELLS YOU GET FIT AND THE

Line_1255	MARNEY KITTY REA CHEAT THAT PLEASE WA
Line_1256	I HAVE NO GLAD A CHICK YOU TELL ME AND WE
Line_1257	WITH TWO BATTERIES AND ONE LIGHT BULB IT'LL NOT WORK BUT WITH TWO BATTERIES TWO LIGHT BULBS THE TO WORK
Line_1258	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
Line_1259	I THINK NUMBER ONE WHICH IT ON THE TOP
Line_1260	I THINK A CIRCUIT NUMBER TWO AND A CCD CIRCUIT IN EVERY THI
Line_1261	WE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND EVERY
Line_1262	CAN YOU REPEAT UH THESE SLOWLY
Line_1263	EN YOU DON'T HAVE A CIRCUIT NO
Line_1264	A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1265	UM I KNOW
Line_1266	I HI THAT'S CARRY UM CAN YOU REPEAT THAT SLOWLY OR CAN YOU SAY LIKE A CHIPMUNK K
Line_1267	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW HAVE A FUEL CIRCUIT
Line_1268	CAN YOU REPEAT E THAT SLOWLY
Line_1269	UM I CAN NOT I DON'T KNOW
Line_1270	B BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CRACK
Line_1271	I TOLD YOU THE LIGHT BULB FILLMENT IS NOT LARGE
Line_1272	CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME MY KNOWING FRIEND YONARE WAS BUGGING ME
Line_1273	ING NOISE THAT MYNOYING FANCHIONA WAS BEING E
Line_1274	N CAN S THE LIGHT BUBBLE
Line_1275	KEE ON LIVE SHE FE HE ON A THAT MADNEWAS BUGGING H
Line_1276	RAN WA THE THING IS UP THERE'S TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS TWO MORE WIRE
Line_1277	THE FILAMENT BROKE
Line_1278	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT'S PLACED
Line_1279	BY AND BESIDE CAN YOU GOT A PET THE HEN'T GET ME A P
Line_1280	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGMISM
Line_1281	T SOUTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL STICK BUT IF SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL REPEL
Line_1282	UM I CAN'T CAREERS GET TO LESS IMP
Line_1283	IT'S METAL SO IT WILL ATTRACT A MAGNET
Line_1284	A NAIL IS STICKING TO A DON SHAPED MAGNE
Line_1285	IT STICKS BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL
Line_1286	THE METAL DOES NOT ATTRACT TO THE CLOCK BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
Line_1287	BECAUSE ONES CAN ATTRACT TO A MAGNET BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_1288	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL HAS ONE NAIL HAS IRON AND METAL AND THE OTHERS DOESN'T
Line_1289	IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_1290	I I THINK IT HAS METAL OR STEEL OR IRON IN IT BECAUSE IT'S STICKING
Line_1291	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1292	IT STICK BECAUSE IT HAS IRON METAL OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1293	BECAUSE IT'S STEEL WON'T METAL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1294	I'M GOOD I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1295	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1296	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
Line_1297	THE D CELL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN IT GIVES OFF ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1298	IT MEANS LIKE A PAS WEIGHT TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ENERGY AND THE WIRES
Line_1299	I SEE TRAVELS MEANS LIKE IT GOES LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB TO SEND OFF ELECTRICITY
Line_1300	THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY
Line_1301	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ABOUT LIKE CAN END THE LIGHT SO THEN YOU COULD SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IT'S NOT JUST A ITCH BLACK PLATE
Line_1302	IT MEANS LIKE IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE WIRES
Line_1303	I I SEE THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT AND GOING IN THE CIRCLE SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1304	IT IS FLOWING THE LEFT WAY LIKE IT GOES RIGHT AND THEN IT GOES DOWN IN A IT'S GOT AROUND
Line_1305	HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_1306	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE WIRES I SEE IN THE PICTURE IS GOING THROUGH AND AND GOING OUT THAT'S HOW IT WORK
Line_1307	THE END OF THE D CELL WITH THE MINE IS ONE
Line_1308	S FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1309	THE BUDS REPRESENT THAT THE THE BUDS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FROM
Line_1310	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING I'M SORRY I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHNI
Line_1311	IT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY IT IS GOING NOW IT'S GOING THE LEFT WAY NOT THE RIG
Line_1312	IT GOES THE WAY IT WAS FOLLING
Line_1313	THE MINE'S
Line_1314	WHAT'S SIT UP I DON'T SEE ANY SIT UP
Line_1315	S I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HINTS ABOUT IT
Line_1316	UP THE D CELL TO MAKE IT WORK IF IF THERE WASN'T A D CELL THEN HOW WOULD THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1317	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING AND I IT WON'T WORK
Line_1318	I NOTICE THAT WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH THE FLAG STOPS TO MOVE AND THEN WHEN I STICK IT AGAIN THEN IT STOPS MOVING
Line_1319	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR HAS WIRES HE TO WEIGH AND THE WIRES ARE UP TO THE SOLAR POWER
Line_1320	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN IT MEANS THAT IT'S COLLECTING ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR POWER TO MAKE IT WORKS
Line_1321	IT WON'T WORK AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN HOW WILL YOU MAKE THIS A MOTOR WORK
Line_1322	THE FLAG ITS THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_1323	WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT FLAG IS NOT MOVING
Line_1324	IF THE WAG IS T MOVING THEN IT MEANS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER IT
Line_1325	WELL NO HOW IS YOUR D
Line_1326	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1327	CAN YOU PLEAASE US THE QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1328	I NOTICED THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BY THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1329	UH ANYTHING THAT'S METAL CAN MINE MOTOR
Line_1330	I NOTICE THAT IF THE STICK IS WARD AND IT DOESN'T COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY AND THE MOTOR'S NOT RUNNING
Line_1331	TO IT'S HAVE PENNOLES THAT
Line_1332	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1333	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1334	WHAT CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT IT OF ANNOYING LITTLE ATE RIGHT RIGHT NOW AROUND MA THING YOU STOCK AND SMACK SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1335	THE MOTOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTOR IS IT DOESN'T RUN
Line_1336	PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1337	THEY ARE MAKING THE MOTORS RUN
Line_1338	WE RIGHT NOW SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT LET
Line_1339	THE BRASS ROOM THE PAPER CLIP THE HOLD ON THE MACHINE R CLIP
Line_1340	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1341	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1342	WE'VE BEEN DOING HOW SHE WOOD WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1343	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FIOUL
Line_1344	IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT
Line_1345	YE I DON'T SHARE ANYTHING WHEN THE CANDLE BURNS S
Line_1346	IF A CANDLE DIDN'T MAKE SOUND THEN IT WOULD MAKE LIKE P NOISE I
Line_1347	I CAN SEE THAT THE FLAME IS MOVING BACK AND FORWARDS FORTH SLOWLY
Line_1348	I SEE THAT THERE IS A FEOUWE WOOD AND THE CANDLE AND THE THREE APPLES
Line_1349	LINKING AROUND
Line_1350	ITS TURNED INTO SMOKE
Line_1351	REPEAT PLEASED
Line_1352	THE MOTOR THE MOTORS WE STARTED SPINNING IN A CIRCLE B
Line_1353	WE TAKE THE FROM EH
Line_1354	NA I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_1355	THEY BOTH COLLECT D
Line_1356	AND COAL AND GASES WILL MAKE A FIRE
Line_1357	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1358	REPEAT
Line_1359	I DO NOT COMPLETELY KNOW
Line_1360	UM REA PEA PLUBEAE
Line_1361	WE PLACED POLLICE
Line_1362	I THINK THE BATTERY WOULD RUN OUT ENERGY BECAUSE YOU MORE LIGHT BULBS AND THE IT WON'T BE THAT BRIGHT
Line_1363	RE BE SCHLEESE CHEESE D
Line_1364	IF YOU ADD ONE MORE MORE D CELLS THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1365	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1366	WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN DOING SOCIAL STUDIES ON THAT SCIENCE
Line_1367	WHAT I'VE OBSERVED ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT IS THAT PICKS STICK TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1368	WHAT IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH SHAKING TO A MAGNET IS THAT A MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS IRON AND STEEL
Line_1369	WHAT'S IN THE METAL IS IT IS LIKE TINY BITS OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT HELPS IT STICK
Line_1370	VOUVORY PEAKED PILIECE
Line_1371	IT IS TRUE THAT PAPER CLIPS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1372	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1373	I'M GOOD TODAY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1374	WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT THE
Line_1375	I THINK THAT BECAUSE I I LEARNED IT
Line_1376	THEY'RE FACING THE SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER AND THOSE DOTS ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO WITH L
Line_1377	THE SUMMARABOUTUM IS THAT SOUTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THE FACT BECAUSE THEY'RE FACING THEY'RE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO WITH THE ATTRACT
Line_1378	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1379	WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS THAT T TO LEARN ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_1380	HE ONE EAT
Line_1381	WHAT MAKES ME SAY THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED IT WITH A MAGNET AND A PAPER CLIP AND I I USED IT UP TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WHICH IS LIKE ATTRACT
Line_1382	OKIE WHAT'S DO MAGNET IS SENDING I LI UHM MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO PICK UP OTHER STOVKIE
Line_1383	THREAPIE PLEASED
Line_1384	THAT AS YOUR MOM WAS PAYING YOUR PINE
Line_1385	REPEAT THE
Line_1386	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MINE CECIALS ARE IN LEARNING TALL
Line_1387	WHAT'S IT ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT MAGNET WILL ATTRACT
Line_1388	WHAT MAKES ME SEE THAT IS BECAUSE I TESTED IT OUT
Line_1389	WHAT'S ABOUT THAT IS I HATE YOU AND A
Line_1390	NOT REALISED HOW ARE YOU
Line_1391	SKIN ME LEN THE PIE
Line_1392	YOU HAVE TO PUT OUR PAINTS
Line_1393	RUPET IT'S I D I CIFITY
Line_1394	WILL IN WE LEARNED HE WHEN TO BE DONE
Line_1395	IF COLLECTED FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_1396	THERE IS A BEAD ONE
Line_1397	LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1398	A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1399	THEY POWER STUFF LIKE COMPUTORES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_1400	IT STORES ENERGY AND THEN IT GIVES OTHER THINGS ENERGY TO USE
Line_1401	I DON'T KNOW DON'T
Line_1402	ELECTRICITY OR POWER
Line_1403	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT THEY RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES OR THE BATTERY
Line_1404	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1405	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH WARS THE POSITIVE END
Line_1406	IT GOES TOWARDS THE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEG
Line_1407	IT GOES BACK TO WHAT IT WAS NO THE WE A THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS BACK TO THE SIDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO US IN THE FIRST
Line_1408	ITS IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE TOUCH
Line_1409	IT WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T F FLOW LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_1410	THE SIDES THE SIDES WORKS
Line_1411	WE'VE BEEN LOVING LEARNING HOW A MOTOR WORK
Line_1412	BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWER BY THE D CELLS AND THE MOTOR IS POWERING THE FLAG
Line_1413	THAT THERE IS POWERING THE MOTOR IT HAS EN
Line_1414	THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D CELLS
Line_1415	IT MI I DON'T KNOW HOW SO I DON'T
Line_1416	IT IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER SO THE FLAGS CAN RUN
Line_1417	THIS IS UM MOTOR WITH A SWITCH A CIRCUIT WITH A SWI-
Line_1418	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_1419	BECAUSE THE SWITCH WAS IS TOUCHING THE WIRE
Line_1420	IT STOPS BECAUSE IT CAN'T FLOW THROUGH THE PUFF TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1421	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1422	W WHEN IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE THE MOTOR SPINS WHEN IT'S NOT THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_1423	I I WAS ABSENT THAT DAY
Line_1424	THAT THE SUNS IS THERE TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_1425	IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1426	TH THE FLAG STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1427	IT PRODUCES ENERGY SO THAT SOLAR SOIL OR PANEL CAN GET ENERGY FOR THE MOUNT
Line_1428	IT IS A CIRCUIT WITH THE MOTOR
Line_1429	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING OF WHAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH
Line_1430	HOW ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SOMETHING BUT NOT OTHERS
Line_1431	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH EVERY FINAL PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1432	THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1433	SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE LIST WORKS BUT OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE SPUNGES AND THE ROCKS
Line_1434	THAT WITH STICKS THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_1435	IT IS A OPEN
Line_1436	IT DOES AN IT STOPS SPINNING
Line_1437	UH I COULDN'T MOVE MY IT UM I SO
Line_1438	THEY ARE METAL
Line_1439	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS ATTRACT AND REPEL EACH OTH
Line_1440	PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1441	THEY'RE MAKING THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
Line_1442	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_1443	IT ISN'T JUST TWO WIRES IT'S FORT WIRES
Line_1444	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_1445	E EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
Line_1446	THEY ARE LIGHTING UP CLEARLY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE I THINK THEY EACH HAS THEIR OWN H WHAT DO YOU PATHWAY
Line_1447	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL S SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1448	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1449	REPEAT THAT SLEET
Line_1450	IT IS SHOWING WHAT PATHWAY IT'S GOING
Line_1451	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS BUT ONE D CELL
Line_1452	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOP ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE LIGHT BULBS ON THE BOTH
Line_1453	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_1454	NEED THEY NEED A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_1455	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN CONNECTED IT'S NOT T
Line_1456	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT DOESN'T
Line_1457	YOU HACTUAL REPLACE THE LIGHT BULB OR D CELL
Line_1458	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WORKS BETTER THAN A NORMAL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATH
Line_1459	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY OF ENERGY
Line_1460	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_1461	YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1462	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND NOT THE THERE IS NO PATHWAY
Line_1463	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY
Line_1464	THE LIGHT BULB BURN OUT
Line_1465	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1466	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1467	A SERIES I MEAN AN PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1468	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS KEEPS SLIGHTING
Line_1469	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS HOLE HEEPS GIVING WE
Line_1470	ONE FILL BROKE BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS ARE STILL WORKING
Line_1471	THE FILAMENT IT BURNS OUT BUT THE LIGHT BULB THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UP
Line_1472	THEY ALL CONNECT TO THE D CELL
Line_1473	HERE IS A BURN OUT FILAMENT
Line_1474	BECAUSE THE FILM BROKE AND THERE IS NO OTHER PATHWAY TO GET THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1476	THE SIDE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1477	I LEARNED THAT IN CLASS THAT IRON OR STEEL ATTRACT MAGNETS
Line_1478	THE THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1479	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_1480	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET THE MATE YEAH
Line_1481	WHERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1482	S YES THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE IT
Line_1483	WORK DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1484	IRONS THAT MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_1485	THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF IT
Line_1486	THEY STICK TO STUFF THAT ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1487	ONE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN
Line_1488	THE ONE THAT IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_1489	THE STUFF THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT STICKS BUT THE STUFF DOMES THAT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1490	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN
Line_1491	BIT STICKS
Line_1492	ALL I'M I HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT AND THAT'S WAY
Line_1493	SOME METALS HAVE IRON IN THEM OR STEEL AND THOSE WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1494	BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL AND SAY INSIDE OF IT
Line_1495	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1496	NORTH AND SOUTH NORTH AND SOUTH STICK TOGETHER BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH WERE
Line_1497	THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE MAGNET ARE STICKING
Line_1498	BECAUSE SIDES NORTH AND NORTH WE FELL BUT SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1499	SIDE NORTH AND NORTH SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL BUT NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1500	UH THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING OR SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ATTRACTING
Line_1501	A GIRL HIKING A NORTH
Line_1502	I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S POINTING NORTH B
Line_1503	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACTS BUT NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1504	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH THE TRAY
Line_1505	SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1506	THERE IS A MAGNET A MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUT THE TABLE IS STOPPING IT FROM GETTING ALL THE WAY THERE
Line_1507	UH THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FORCE TO REACH THE PAPER CLIP SO IT CAN'T MOVE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1508	THE MAGNET IS TRAVELING THE MAG NEGATIVE FLOOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1509	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING INTO THE NAIL AND IT'S MAKING IT ACT LIKE A T
Line_1510	THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL STICKS LIKE A MAGNET SO THE PAPER CLIP CAN STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_1511	THE MAGNET IT'S TO BE REALLY STRONG E
Line_1512	AT THE TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_1513	BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORCE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRAVELS THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICKS UP THE PAPER
Line_1514	IT HELPS THE NAIL WILL GET A MAGNETIC FORCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1515	THE NAIL WOULD LUSE IT'S FORCE
Line_1516	IT WON'T BECOME A MAGNET FOR A MAGNET IS N'T TOUCHING IT
Line_1517	THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET WHICH IS PICKING UP THE PAPER
Line_1518	IT'S BECOMING A TEMPORARAL A RE YOU MAGNET
Line_1519	IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET IS TOUCHING IT AND THEN IT HAS A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1520	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1521	THE NAIL IS BECOMING A TEMPORARY TEMPORARARLY A MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1522	BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1523	IT'S SHOWING IF A MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1524	THAT IF IT'S TOUCHING IF A MAGNET IS TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT THING CAN BECOME A TEMPORARY MAG
Line_1525	THE MAGNET IS GIVING THE PA THE NAIL MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER C
Line_1526	WIPE
Line_1527	IT'S CHECKING HOW MANY WASHERS IT CAN TAKE IN THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS IS BROKEN UP
Line_1528	ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE IS TWO MAGNETS AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS A BUNCH OF WASHERS S
Line_1529	WHEN I ADD MORE WASHERS THE LIT
Line_1530	IT TROP IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT
Line_1531	THE DISTANCE IS GOING
Line_1532	IT BREAKS IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE E
Line_1533	THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_1534	THE FORCE IS A STRONG ENOUGH SO EVEN ONE WASHER COULD BREAK UP THE WHOLE THE WHOLE FLOOR BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_1535	YOU PUT MORE SPACERS
Line_1536	THE MAGNETIC FORCE GETS UM IT GETS EASIER TO BREAK EVERY TIME YOU HAD A SPACER
Line_1537	IT BREAKS UP THE FORCE A LITTLE
Line_1538	WEARING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1539	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACT SIDES NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH W
Line_1540	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1541	GETTING THOSE ITS TO ACT LIKE A MAGNET
Line_1542	YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE RIVET AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN
Line_1543	IT MAKES THE RIVETRENT BECOME A MAGNET
Line_1544	IT BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1545	WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S THE RIVET BECOMES A MAGNET BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT STOPS
Line_1546	ITS STOPS BECOMING A MAGNET
Line_1547	HERE IS A ELECTRONIC FORCE AROUND THE WRAPPED WIRES
Line_1548	WE HAVE TO WRAP IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_1549	UH YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1550	THE RIFIT BECOMES A MAGNET
Line_1551	IT OPENS OR CLOSES THE B
Line_1552	IT HAS TO BE NEXT TO THE RIVET
Line_1553	WHEN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPENED THEN THE STEEL RIVET ISN'T A MAGNET ANY MORE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S A MAGNET
Line_1554	ENERGY IN
Line_1555	WIRE WIRES BATTERY AND IT
Line_1556	A BATTERY A PARA WIRES AND NOT A FUMES
Line_1557	THERE'S THE WIRES UM IF YOU PUT THEM INTO THE BETTER THEY WILL UM YOU'LL MAKE THE TRANSVEARN
Line_1558	THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB RUNS
Line_1559	THE BATTERY IS A UM LIKE A ENERGY
Line_1560	A LIGHT BULB NEEDS POWER
Line_1561	THE SOURCE OF ENERGY MEANS THAT UM IT STORES ENERGY
Line_1562	BIT PROVIDES ENERGY
Line_1563	TO TO TO TO PROVIDE AND Y
Line_1564	THEY MAKE THE FLOW THE ENERGY COULD TRAVEL THROUGH THEM TO POWER AN
Line_1565	HAVE A SULAMENT AND IT DOES HELP THE
Line_1566	THEN IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY
Line_1567	THEN WE FLEW HEAT AND IT MAKES LIGHT
Line_1568	THE TRI ELECTRICITY THAT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB IS TO POWER IN THE FILAMENT
Line_1569	BE CAUSE THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1570	THE ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB GOING ON TO THE LIGHT B
Line_1571	TITTY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1572	THE ELECTRICITY FROWS ITS STORED AND THEN PULL AND IT ONE SOMETHING HITS IT IT GOES OUT OF IT AND IT
Line_1573	ITS THE POSITIVE NO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1574	THE LITTLE DOTS IN CLIP THOSE PICTURES THE ENERGY FLOWING A TRAVEL THROUGH IT DIDN'T COME
Line_1575	FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1576	BLUE DOTS REPRESENT IS IN IT
Line_1577	IT FLIPPED AROUND THEN THE ENERGY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING OUT TO OTHER ENDS
Line_1578	IT UM THE LIGHT BULB GOES OFF THEN IT TURNS AROUND THEN ENERGY COMES OUT TO WHERE THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1579	ITS THE ENERGY FLOWS A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1580	IT IS FLOWING BEHIND THE IS FLOWING FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT'S FLOWING BACK INTO THE MIN UH NO
Line_1581	IT'S THAT THE PART MINE SIDE IS THROWING OUT ENERGY TO ING UP THE MINE SIDE AND THE ENERGY'S COMING BACK IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1582	THERE WOULD BE NO ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1583	I NOTICE THAT ON THIS SIDE IF ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE BOTTOM IT'LL AND THE ONES ON THE SIDE IT WILL LIGHT UP BUT IF THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM THEY WON
Line_1584	WE UM WERE JUST EXPERIENCE WITH A MOTOR
Line_1585	MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS POWERING
Line_1586	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE IT
Line_1587	R MEANS THAT UM IT RECEIVES THE
Line_1588	ENERGY MUST FLOW WITH THREE WIRES TO THE END TO THERE IS
Line_1589	BE UM IN THE MORTORS IT'S THERE IS A CIRCUIT CENTURY SMOVEING
Line_1590	BATTERY HAS ENERGY SO THE WIRE IS TAKING THE ENERGY AND P
Line_1591	THERE'S A SWITCH THERE'S A SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_1592	IS TO THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE BATTERY THE METAL SO THAT'S WHERE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL THEN GOING TO
Line_1593	YEAH I GOT WHOLE N NIMELMENT IS TO S
Line_1594	TO WITCH CAME ON CARRYING IT ON AND
Line_1595	BURNS IT TURNS HIS BATTERY THE MOTOR ON
Line_1596	IT'S ENERGY FLOW WILL STOPPING RETREAT
Line_1597	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ON TO THE
Line_1598	NOTICE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE METAL IT'S A TRAIN WHEN YOU TAKE IT ALL
Line_1599	IT DIDN'T THE BED CLOSED
Line_1600	THE ELECTRICITY THE SWITCH HAS TO BE COME TO METAL BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT
Line_1601	THE PANEL IS LIKE UM IT'S A RECEIVER BUT IT'S LIKE A BATTER
Line_1602	THE RECEIVER AND A BATTERI AT THE SAME TIME ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO POWER THEM
Line_1603	THE FOR THE SOLAR POWER TO RUN TO MAKE ENERGY THE SUN HAS TO BE OUT
Line_1604	THE SAUCE CANNOT MAKE AN ENERGY SWERCHE THAT BUT THE ENERGY COMES DOWN AND AND HITS THE SOIL PAIN
Line_1605	ITS DI SOLAR CELL WOULD STOP BROWNING
Line_1606	WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN UM IT DOESN'T CALLED THE MOTOR
Line_1607	THEY'RE RUNNING AND ONE IS THE THE MORE STOPS WERE IT
Line_1608	IT STARTS WORKING IT STOPS WORK
Line_1609	THE MORTORS THE MOTORS THE DRAIN
Line_1610	BEFORE IT DOESN'T HIT THE BATTERY THE CONAL POWER ABOUT IT HITS THE WHAT YOU CALL IT
Line_1611	IS UN THE PICK DO MOTORS RAIN
Line_1612	R AND THE PANEL IS MOVING
Line_1613	FIRE IS LIKE THAT FILL
Line_1614	IT GIVES US HEAT AND IT
Line_1615	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU NEED ENERGY TO POWER EVERYTHING ON YOUR HOUSE
Line_1616	UH THE ENERGY IS LIKE A FLU FEEL FOR THE L
Line_1617	HIT HURT HIT HIT
Line_1618	IT'S YOU WALK
Line_1619	IT IS MOLTEN
Line_1620	THERE WAS NO SOUND THE
Line_1621	IT IS BURNING IT ON FIRE AND IT'S GOING TO MELT AND FIVE THOUSAND METERS
Line_1622	THERE IS SOUND ENERGY
Line_1623	SHE IS EATING A APPLE SHE'S WALKING
Line_1624	I CAN HEAR A SOUND
Line_1625	I SEE A APPLES A CANDLE WOOD AND A FEUWELE CAN
Line_1626	IT IT'S UH B HE NEDE
Line_1627	P D I AND APPLES
Line_1628	BECAUSE THEY POINT BOTH NO ENERGY
Line_1629	CANNON REPEAT THAT BECAUSE DEVLE WAS TALKING
Line_1630	BECAUSE THE GAS COAL BURN AND THEY MAKE FIRES
Line_1631	AND THE SOLAR AND THE WHEN METAL DON'T THEY PRODUCE IT
Line_1632	IT WILL PULL IT DE
Line_1633	HOW YOU MARRICIED
Line_1634	UM IT WILL POLLUTE DOOR AND NOT YOU MARRIED
Line_1635	BECAUSE THAT GIRLS ENERAGE I AND ARE YOU MARRIED
Line_1636	MARNEY ARE YOU MARIO SOMERIEN MY SCHOOL
Line_1637	OH MAN I DA I JUST HAD TO TWIST
Line_1638	IT IS A IT FELT A CURRENT OF ENERGY E IN A CIRCUIT
Line_1639	ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE L
Line_1640	ENERGY HAS TO BE FALLING THROUGH ITS
Line_1641	UM DON'T KNOW
Line_1642	IT'S THROWING THROUGH THE TWO LIGHTBULBS
Line_1643	ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THIS ONE IN THE WIRES TAKES THE ENERGY GOES TO THE THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BING COMES TO THE OTHER ONE
Line_1644	THAT IS THE ENERGY S
Line_1645	IT HAS TO BE FLOWED THROUGH MANY TOILET RECEIVERS
Line_1646	MOTABULE AND CON ENERGY FLOWS THERE COMES YOU OUT TO THE LIGHT BULBS ONE LIGHT BULB GET ANOTHER AND THEN COME BACK
Line_1647	THREES THREE THREE
Line_1648	YOU NEED MORE POWER SOURCE
Line_1649	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GAIN
Line_1650	THAT THEY GET DIMMER
Line_1651	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_1652	IT GOVES IN MORE ENERGY
Line_1653	UM IF IT ONCE IT THEN BOTH OF THEM GOES OUT ONE OF THEM GOES OUT THEN YOU HAVE TO REPLACE ANOTHER ON
Line_1654	BECAUSE THEY THEN PRESS AND PRESS WERE TOUCHING TOGETHER
Line_1655	UM WHEN YOU TURN ONE OF THE S D CELLS AROUND IT WILL START WORKING AGAIN
Line_1656	IF IF TWO OF THE SAME SIDE TOGETHER IT WON'T WORK
Line_1657	DON'T WELL PUT TWO BATTERIES TOGETHER ON THE SAME SIDE
Line_1658	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS TO IT REALLY BRIGHT
Line_1659	UM THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT HAS ONE BATTERY BUT FOUR WIRES
Line_1660	H I DON'T KNOW
Line_1661	EACH HAD THE OVER AND T I CHE THE LONG PATHWAY
Line_1662	A WAI SLOW POLES FALL WARD
Line_1663	IT IT'S GAIN FAR THE NEGATIVE TO THE TO LIGHT BULB B
Line_1664	I SEE UH I SEE IT'S GOING NORTH
Line_1665	THAT IS REALLY C
Line_1666	IT FLOWS UM WHEN A STONE FLOWING THROUGH THE AIR ONE'S IT IT FLOWS THROUGH THE POSIT
Line_1667	UH ABCIRVEDY GOES FROM ONE TO AN
Line_1668	IT IS BURNING NOT IT'S NOT BURNING AS LONG IT'S BURNING RU QUICK
Line_1669	THERE IS TWO OPAL SOURCES
Line_1670	UM IT'S SHARING THE SAME POWER SOURCE IT NO NEVER MIND
Line_1671	THEY'RE SHARING THE SAME FLOWER OF THE NUZEAH
Line_1672	YES THERE IS TWO BUT THE IT IS MORE ENERGY SO THAT'S WHY IT'S YOUR RIGHT
Line_1673	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1674	ARRELEL CIRCUIT ON THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1675	THE TOP R PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1676	BECAUSE EXPERIMENT WITH AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1677	THERE IS A BAR MAGNET GOING A MAGNET AND A HARSH
Line_1678	MAGNETS MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_1679	MAGNETS ONLY COULD STICK TO ANYTHING MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1680	MADDY CAN YOU REPEET THAT
Line_1681	ER STICKING CLUPULI FIGURE EATER
Line_1682	THERE THE JURITOUR IS MADE OF IRON FROM STEEL
Line_1683	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL AND I DON'T HAVE A MAGNET
Line_1684	FINE REPEAT THAT
Line_1685	CAN ARE PIE THAT
Line_1686	WOOD AND ALUMINIUM CHEESED
Line_1687	REASON THAT IS BECAUSE ONLY CERTAIN ITEMS IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IR-
Line_1688	THEN THE WOODEN BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1689	THE IT'S DE IRON ANYTHING THAT MADE THOSE TWO MATERIALS WILL STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1690	B BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL
Line_1691	OH ANY OTHER MIXTURES
Line_1692	THAT THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING AND ALUMINNAIL IS NOT BECAUSE THE STEEL WILL IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND THE ALUMINIUM NOT
Line_1693	GELUINIUM ALUNIMUM S AND ALUMINIUM IS NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1694	BECAUSE NOT ALL METALS IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL BUT THE STEEL NAILS ARE MADE OF IRON
Line_1695	IRON AND THE STEEL NAIL
Line_1696	UM A I DON'T KNOW
Line_1697	THE STEEL IN NO YOU HAS IRON IN
Line_1698	THIS DEAR NAIL IS TO THE KING TO ME
Line_1699	THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT HAS IRON IT OVER IT
Line_1700	THE GREY WA ROCK WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO IRON
Line_1701	ITIT HAS STEEL IN IT
Line_1702	IT HAS IRONRON AND STEEL IN IT
Line_1703	BECAUSE IT HAS STE
Line_1704	UH A STEEL
Line_1705	I THINK WE LEARN TODAY IT HAS TO STICK TO MAGNETS IT HAS TO BE UM MADE OF STEEL OR
Line_1706	HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1707	A BATTERY WIRES AND THEN LIGHT BUL
Line_1708	THAT YOU GIVE THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1709	IT'S THE SOURCE THAT GIVES THE UM LIGHT BULB ENERGY
Line_1710	IF THOUGH CONNECTED TO THE D CELL THEY TRANSFER THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1711	THEY THEY LIGHT UP IF IT HAS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1712	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE NOT IT RECEIVES THAT ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1713	THE D CELL IS GIVING THE THE LIGHT BULB UM AND D THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1714	THEM THE POWER COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND COMES TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1715	IT GIVES IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1716	IT LIGHTS UP
Line_1717	IT MOVES THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_1718	THE NEGATIVE
Line_1719	PUT BOTH OF THE WIRE THERE'S ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S ONE WIRE GOING FROM THIS SIDE
Line_1720	IT WOULDN'T GIVE IT ANY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE COULDN'T BE ANY GOING OUT IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_1721	THE LIGHT BULB NOT LIT UP WHEN I CHANGED IT TO A SIDES
Line_1722	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING LEARNING ABOUT MOTALES AND WILES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTAL MOMENT IF THE THING
Line_1723	THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND ITS MAKING THE MOTALE MOVE
Line_1724	THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTALE IS WALKING AND IT'S MOVING
Line_1725	THE A MOTOR IS WALKING
Line_1726	WHERE'S ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT
Line_1727	THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1728	THAT IT'S THAT THE THE IT'S THAT'S IT'S OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S OFF
Line_1729	THE MOTABLE STOPS MOVING
Line_1730	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1731	S IT'S IN THE CLOSED POSITION
Line_1732	NOT ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTAL BECAUSE NOT TRAVELING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THE MOTAL RUN
Line_1733	THEY UH THE SUN COMES IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON IT IT GIVES ELECTRICITY D TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1734	IT'S SANIEAW AND THE SOLAR PANEL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTALE
Line_1735	THE HOLE PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
Line_1736	THE DOLL PANELS UM GIVING IT ELECTRICITY CELLS CAN MOVE
Line_1737	THAT IT TORN S THE SUN SHINE INTO ELECTRICITY AND GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO OTHERS THINGS
Line_1738	I NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NO SUNK ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO ELECTRICITY
Line_1739	THE MOTALE S STOPS RUNNING
Line_1740	IT GIVES A SOL PANEL'S ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTAL SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTAL RUNS AND MOVE S
Line_1741	IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY TO GET IT TO IT DOESN'T GIVES IT ELECTRICITY
Line_1742	MAKES THE MOTALS MOVE
Line_1743	T IT'S NOT GIVING IT ELECTRICITY TO MOVE
Line_1744	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTNAL ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTAL MOVES
Line_1745	WE HAVE BEEN LONING ABOUT CILLIES' CIRCUITS
Line_1746	THERE'S A CANDLE IN IT'S LIGHT AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GIVING OFF H ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1747	THE WAX IS BURNING BECAUSE IT'S THE CANDLE IS GIVING OFF YOU ENERGY FROM THE PILE
Line_1748	HEAT ENERGY LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1749	LIGHT HAND AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1750	NO YOU NO YOU DO NOT YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING THERE'S NO SOUND ENERGY TOO IT
Line_1751	GIVING OFF GIVING OFF LIGHT AND HEAT
Line_1752	THE SETTLE ENERGY AND DOES ALSO FOOD ENERGY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE FOOD ENERGY TO MAKE YOUR HANDS MOVE TO TO DO THAT
Line_1753	IT'S MAKING A SOUND AND THAT SOUND IS SOUND ENERGY SOUND ENERGY
Line_1754	SIUDRENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY
Line_1755	I SEE IT I GUESS CAN I SEE WOOD I SEE APPLES I SEE MODE AND I SEE A CANDLE
Line_1756	IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_1757	IT'S TURNED INTO EXHAUST AND EXHAUST ALL POLLUTE L
Line_1758	ONE IS ONE IS LIKE A LIQUID AND ONE IS JUST LIKE LIKE A BLOCK IT'S JUST SOLID
Line_1759	IT WILL POLLUTE STEEL
Line_1760	THE GAS COAL WILL POLLUTE THE LFS AND THE SOL PANELS AND THE WIND BINES WON'T
Line_1761	I IT WOULD POLLUTE IT WOULD POLLUTE IT
Line_1762	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING CILLIERS CIRCUITS
Line_1763	THE D CELL IS GIVING POWER FROM THE NEGATIVE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDES INTO THE WIRES TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1764	THAT ONE D CELL CAN BE USED TO POW THE MANY THINGS THAT IT AT ONE TIME
Line_1765	THAT THEY ALL ALL IN THE CIRCUIT AND THEY ALL DO PULL A JUMP AND THE CIRCUIT
Line_1766	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE D CELL AND THEN MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES TO WHATEVELLS HOOKED UP TO THE WIRES
Line_1767	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND BOTH THE LIGHT BULB'S
Line_1768	THAT IT'S GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN COMING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1769	THAT REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FLOWING
Line_1770	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE BATTERIES TO MAKE THEM LIGHT I MEANT INTO THE LIGHT BULBS TO MAKE THEM LIGHT
Line_1771	FLOWS FROM IT FLOWS FROM A D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND BACK
Line_1772	ONE PATHWAY GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULB'S
Line_1773	TAKES MORE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1774	IT GETS IT GETS LESS LIGHT
Line_1775	BECAUSE ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS YEAH SQUAT AND THE ELECTRO LIGHT IN EVERY THING SO YEAH
Line_1776	IT HAS IT'S OWN PA LAY
Line_1777	SO WE S THEY BOTH ALL USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1778	THEY BOTH ARE THEY BOTH ARE USING THE SAME PATHWAYS
Line_1779	THE LIGHT BULBS BECOME BRIGHT AL
Line_1780	WELL THE CILLIES CIRCUIT IT WOULD THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE DIM BUT IN A PILL PILLLEVE CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE THE LIGHT
Line_1781	THERE IS CILLIES CIRCUITS AND PILL PILL WELL LEVEL CIRCUIT'S
Line_1782	SOME HILL D ON HALFWAY OF ELECTRICITY AND SOME HAVE THO OWN PALE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1783	WELL THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ENERGY AND THEY WON'T BE AS BRIGHT THAT AWAY
Line_1784	WELL SOME SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY AND SOME DON'T BUT IF THEY SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY THEY WON'T BE AS LIGHT
Line_1785	WELL THE FLOW WOULD THEY SHOULD THE SAME FLOW SO THE LIGHT BULBS ONTO BE AS LIGHT
Line_1786	THAT SHOWING THE SAME A FLOW
Line_1787	WELL IT SO IT'S CHILLING ENERGY FROM A LIGHT BULB FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1788	IT'S FLOWING IN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE M LIGHT BULB
Line_1789	WELL IT'S COMING OUT OF THE SIDE AND GOING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1790	WELL THE TOP ONES LIGHT THE BOTTOM ONE IS NOT SO LIGHT AND BUT LIKE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SHOWING A PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY THE HELP ONE'S ALVE
Line_1791	THE TOP ONES CAN'T SHINING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1792	WELL IT'S SHOWING THE SAME IT'S SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY SO THEIR NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH AS ELECTRICITY INTO THEM
Line_1793	WELL UM THEY BOTH HAVE TWO BATTERIES NOW INSTEAD OF ONE AND THE PUNY LIKE
Line_1794	UM THE THE TOP TOP THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
Line_1795	UP ONES BECAUSE THE MORE BRITELE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE BETTAL
Line_1796	UM SOLAR DOING A UHM AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1797	CITY A CIRCUIT HAS TO HAVE POWER SO YOU COULD BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1798	A CIRCUIT HELPS TO HELP TO ENERGY
Line_1799	IT ISN'T A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONNECT A A BATTERY AND ALL THE WIRES
Line_1800	S AND THIS IT BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1801	THIS CIRCUIT HAS A PATHWAY WITH THE W
Line_1802	IT HAS IT BECAUSE THAT ELECTRICITY FALLS FROM THE POSITIVE SLIGHT AND UNTO UM THEN IT COMES AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1803	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY
Line_1804	THEY REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_1805	THE I THINK THEY ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY LITTLE R
Line_1806	E POSITIVE SIDES INTO THE NEGATIVE SAME
Line_1807	POSITIVE SIDES
Line_1808	WE HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_1809	IS LESS ELECTRICITY
Line_1810	YEAH MORE THAN ONE D CELL IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTIL IT A CLIP BURNS OUT
Line_1811	BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1812	IT IT DOESN'T GO WITH NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE AND TEN GOES POSITOR POSITIVE GOES NEGATIVE AND POSITIVES
Line_1813	THE MIX IT TURNED OFF IS THAT THE BOTH D CELLS ARE THE POSITIVE AND THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE WITH THE NEGATIVE AND THAT'S MAKING IT TURN OUT
Line_1814	I FLIP THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1815	E ENERGY COULD TRAVEL FOR MILES
Line_1816	LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL ABOUT LIKE IT GIVES YOU WHITE SO Y
Line_1817	WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING A CIANCITING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1818	A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_1819	I IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
Line_1820	TH BOLLYGQUIRES LEAD TO WE PRETHETICLY
Line_1821	UM IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASING WIRE AND IT CASING WIRE
Line_1822	THERE IS NEEDED THREE TWO OR ONE PATHWAY A
Line_1823	WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER
Line_1824	IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT BECAUSE IT WON'T GET THE L
Line_1825	UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIKE POLLUTION BEFORE WE IM OR LIKE TAKE THE LIGHT AND BURN IT OUT
Line_1826	WE HAPPENED WHEN WE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BATTERY
Line_1827	I THINK THEY'D BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1828	WHAT I DISCOVER IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING HO IN THE LIGHT BULB AND CAN WELL SHINING RAIN
Line_1829	I FREEZE LET'S GO
Line_1830	N NOT SO GREAT
Line_1831	ORDER IN ALL ABOUT THE AND QUASIES DIFFICULT THAT'S LIKE THAT AND IT'S MIXED SORT
Line_1832	THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARNEY IT'S BECAUSE THAT AS FINALLY CIRCLING THE WIRE LIKE IT'S PLOSED UP
Line_1833	WAPPIN SAY THE WEATHER REPEATED AND THE FILAMENT WILL L DOWN DOWN DOWN AND AND FLUTTURE
Line_1834	CAUSE ILECDILLILYIRON I CHEESE READ A D
Line_1835	CIRCUIT A CYCLE WHY THE SERIES SO THAT THE AT LEAST HAVE TO BE ONE MORE CONNECTED
Line_1836	THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS CIRCUIT WORKS HIS VI HAS STUFF AND GOINT STUFF OR STOP NING WE YOU HAVE ONE WIRE AND THEN THE CAMOUCATE ON
Line_1837	WE'RE HAVING THE THE ENERGY IS JUST BLASTING OUT INTO THERE BECAUSE IT WAS NUMBERED BY ELECTRICITY INTO
Line_1838	WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE IS NO LIGHT
Line_1839	THEY'RE ALL COM MIX IN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT'S
Line_1840	IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT IT'LL LIGHT UP IT WON'T RE THAT T
Line_1841	WHY DO I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE FILAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN COLLECTOR TO TA
Line_1842	L YE IS THE FILLAMETARY AND YOU BURN OUT
Line_1843	WE'RE THE ELECTRICITY FOUND THAT ONE OTHER CIRCUIT AND WHEN THEY BURN IT OUT UM IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1844	WHAT IS BEING CHALLNEE AS THEY REPLACE BETTER WITH A DIFFERENT NEW ONE
Line_1845	THAT I NOTICE THE H OR RULE ONE IS A LITER LAND WORK THE OIL MAN IS TURNED OUT AND YEAH
Line_1846	WOULD I NOTICE THAT THE ONE LIGHT WHILE BEING UP TO THE ER HAS SPURNT OUT AND IT'S NOT WORKING FAULT
Line_1847	ELL AND HOW AND EVERY FROM STUFF JUST TO LIGHT OR AND
Line_1848	THEY ARE CONNECTED IN A PARA SINCE MORE THE ONE SIDE OR CAN IT
Line_1849	ES WHAT THAT I BELIEVE YEAH IS UM A CRATHETIC AND FILL
Line_1850	THINK IT WILL IN A MIX
Line_1851	THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICITY FLOW STOPS SCORING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BUMP BURNS OUT
Line_1852	UP SIDES
Line_1853	IT'S OR MAGNETISM
Line_1854	MAGNETS TO USE MAGNETISMS
Line_1855	IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
Line_1856	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO METAL
Line_1857	THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM
Line_1858	IT HAS A A CERTAIN KIND OF METAL IN IT
Line_1859	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS A MAGNETS STICKING TO A NAIL
Line_1860	IT IS STICKING BECAUSE IT CERTAIN KINDA METAL
Line_1861	THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT
Line_1862	THE PAPER CLIP AND I GUESS THAT'S ALL
Line_1863	ONE IS STEEL AND ON THE OTHER ONE IS IRON
Line_1864	THE PAPER FACT STICKS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK ROCK
Line_1865	IF I TRY TO GET THAT STICK IT WILL STAY L
Line_1866	IT CONNECTED AND IT STED
Line_1867	BE CAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN METAL IN IT
Line_1868	IT MAY HAVE THE SAME THING AS BLACK ROCKS DOES
Line_1869	RE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1870	I THINK IT WOULD NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME QUODRE
Line_1871	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETISM IS NOT WON'T LET IT STICK TOGETHER
Line_1872	I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE IS CERTAIN PARTS OF IT
Line_1873	IF IT'S AN AN ANSWER CONNECTS IF IT'S ESTES IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S NET IT DOESN'T EITHER
Line_1874	WHAT IS SIMILAR IS THESE SIGNS TO TO CONNECT
Line_1875	WELL ECINIENT ATTRACT NINIS ATTRACT AND AN END AND ASHTON DON'T
Line_1876	WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS DOESN'T WANT LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S NEAR IT'S THE SAME QUART AND THAT THE P
Line_1877	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUADRONS AND THE ERTH
Line_1878	I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER WAY AGAINST THE NORTH OR SOUTH
Line_1879	IT ACTIONS BY IF YOU PUT A MAGNET UNDER IT AND YOU SPIN IT IT'S THE POINTY THING WILL KEEP SPINNING AND SPINNING
Line_1880	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1881	BUT THE DIFFERENT FORCES AND WHEN THEY PUSH BACK
Line_1882	WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
Line_1883	THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CAN NOT REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_1884	ONE ON THE MEGNET DROP WELL UNDER THE TABLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICKED THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET CONDUCTOR A N HOLE
Line_1885	THE HOURCE IS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
Line_1886	UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPER CLIP PAPER ANY THING REALLY
Line_1887	RE NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAT ONE'S LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN LIKE NET CAN HOLD THE PAPER C
Line_1888	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH PEN PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH THE GRATE PAPER CLIP THAT'S
Line_1889	WHAT IT'S GOING ON A THICK PIECE OF PAPER IS THE FORCE THAT THE L CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK AND THAT THEN IT BEGINS IT SO E
Line_1890	WHAT IT'S ALL THE IS TO HOW THE MADE IS HOLDING TO PICK THE CUP AND THAT
Line_1891	OR IT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THAT AS SIGN THINGS TO S
Line_1892	THE MAGNET IS REP FROM THE NAIL AND THERE'S THE NAIL USES IT'S MAGNET
Line_1893	R CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S ANY TIME THE MAGNETS ON IT IT IT REACTS LIKE
Line_1894	GOING ON WHERE JU SEE THE SOMETHING I A DREAMED LAST NIGHT
Line_1895	WHAT DO YOU MEAN SEE THE SAME PICTURE
Line_1896	MORE RING THE AND MOVE BECAUSE ALL SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN NA ON THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1897	I SEE IS A MAGNET AND THEN NAIL AND IT'S FORCE KEPT GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
Line_1898	WHEN IT'S TO MAKE IT ON IT IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN IT'S NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1899	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE MAGNETISM PRESSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAKING IT ST
Line_1900	IT CAN BECAUSE THE MAGNIC CAM FOR
Line_1901	I THINK WHAT ASURING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_1902	MORTALSHOPAN IS IT STICKING TO A NAIL AND IT'S CONNECTED PAPER IT
Line_1903	THE MAGNET IS PAPER AND OTHER CLIP IS ON TOP AND IT GLOWS IT ROUTE
Line_1904	THE FORCE WASN'T TH STRONG ENOUGH
Line_1905	ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
Line_1906	WHAT RAIN IS LIKE PRESSING THE WASHERS GO IN
Line_1907	AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE IT THE FALL
Line_1908	IT'S GOING ON HERE FOR WHEN IT PUTS SPACERS WHEN THE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNET SAYS TO TOUCHING EACH OTHERS
Line_1909	THAT'S ALL THE GOOD IS TO USE THE MAGNET TO SOME OF THE PULL IS FORCED NOW
Line_1910	OR WATER IT DOESN'T MAKES THE AMOUNT IT MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
Line_1911	THERE IS SPREADING A POWDER
Line_1912	WHEN THEY JUST ENTER WHEN WASHED IT BROKE GETS FALL BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE SPACER S
Line_1913	THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS BIORNESS WAS TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WON'T PICK IN IT
Line_1914	BUT IT DOESN'T MIX FRIES WEAKER
Line_1915	THE OR THE SPACERS MADE THE FORCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
Line_1916	UH THAT THE ONES BE HERE IT NIGHTS NO WASHERS TO BREAK IT
Line_1917	BY IT'S FORCE
Line_1918	I NEEDED THREES
Line_1919	OT CAUSE BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER
Line_1920	WHAT IT DOESN'T MIX CAN IT WEAKER W CARE WE CON RING STRONG IT AND USUALLY THE FOUR SEEN
Line_1921	SIENTE
Line_1922	UH IT'S ALL ABOUT A CIRCUIT AND
Line_1923	WE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE UM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CUPS UP THE
Line_1924	WHAT'S IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK COULD GO THROUGH THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WEIGHT BACK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET TRIP TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_1925	THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS A MAGNEGATIE FORCE
Line_1926	IT ACTS A MAGNET I CALECCAT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S IRE STICK
Line_1927	WHAT HAPPEN THESE TO SO THE ENERGY IT GOES S
Line_1928	WHAT THAT RELATES HIS MIXTURES AND
Line_1929	WE LEARNED ABOUT H IT DON'T BE UM YOU'RE GET AFFECTED AND I DON'T WEIGH
Line_1930	THIS WHEN IT'S OPEN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE UM AND CONNECT TO IT THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT IT HAS NO COMPLETE TO THE WIRES
Line_1931	GENERAL AND ELECTRO MAGNETS THE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SOLLUTE
Line_1932	THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S UM AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
Line_1933	UH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1934	MAKES ME THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH UM TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MIX TO GET IT THE MAGNETIC FOR
Line_1935	WE THEY HAVE BEEN THAT THE RIVER AND THE WIRES IT HAS TO LEAST CONNECT SOME TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING IT
Line_1936	THE WIRE'S WRAPPED AROUND A RIVET
Line_1937	UH WHAT THE PANT IS THERE IS NAIL TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUIT UH L IT HAS TO BE CLOSER CUT EVERY
Line_1938	WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
Line_1939	WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY WRAPPING THE WIRE MORE ABOUT THE B
Line_1940	WELL THE MORE YOU HA IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS OR
Line_1941	WHAT I JUST DISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT MORE RAPPING MORE OF THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE WASHERS STICK TO IT
Line_1942	WHEN WHEN IT'LL CREATE MORE THE LIGHT HAS MORE THERE IS UP OR
Line_1943	THE MORE UM WELL IT YOU HAVE WHAT'S HANDY IS THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING THE MORE FORCE INTO IT
Line_1944	DO RELATES THI I
Line_1945	WHEN YOU INCREASE MOR AL BATTERIES UM LIKE LIKE THE LIKE WHEN I WRAPPED AROUND ON OUR VEINS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHERS CATS TWO BATTER
Line_1946	TH IT'S ATTACHED TO THIRTY
Line_1947	WHEN I MINE THE LINE TO SEVEN A MAJOR TEN ONCE UM I'VE SAY BEFORE IT ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP FIVE
Line_1948	WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE WARN TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRO MAGNET TROMMETS ADMARE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVES
Line_1949	THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE REVERSE WHEN D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES LATER GOES UP TO
Line_1950	BUT IT SE AND ABOUT A MELAGRAFF IS NUMBER'S
Line_1951	THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BULB UM CONVERTS TO HUMAN
Line_1952	BY HOW THEY DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS THERE ARE THE WERTHER AH BULBS TO SEE THE SHI PRINTER
Line_1953	H IT SOMETIMES CAN HURT
Line_1954	THE PAD HE CLICKED A SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF THE LAMP
Line_1955	BY THEY REFLECTI'VE HOW IT REACTS
Line_1956	LIKE A METRIC SOMETIMES REFLECTING GO TO THE CENTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_1957	WHAT I KNOW IS THE CERTAIN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT DER AND SOME FOCUS IN ONE SPOT
Line_1958	Y AND I CAN PUT SOME THING ON THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CA
Line_1959	THEY BAGS OFF AND RE COLLECT TO OTHER STUFF
Line_1960	IT BOUNCES OFF AND REFLEX TRIMETORS THINK
Line_1961	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTING ALL THE MAN WHICH GIVES HIM SO HE COULD SEE HIMSELF ON HIS REFLECTION
Line_1962	THE STICK IS REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TIME AND WAVING THE WALL AND IT SHOWS IT ON THE WATER
Line_1963	IT WILL EVENTUALLY HIT THE STAR EAR
Line_1964	A PANOLUTION AND CUP OF THE WATER
Line_1965	HM THE REFLECTION
Line_1966	SOLITLES AND CIRCUITS AND THE D
Line_1967	USTRAINING COLOR
Line_1968	GIVES OFF LIGHT GREEN AND OR INCH A BECAUSE YOU COULD ONLY USE THE LIGHT
Line_1969	IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE LIGHT FOR TWO PERSON
Line_1970	ITCH THE PERSON IS CHUGGING IT COLORED
Line_1971	WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS ON IT REFLECTS OFF
Line_1972	THE COLORS REFLECT OFTEN IT HAD JUST A COLOR
Line_1973	SEVEN IT LOOKS
Line_1974	THE LIGHT IS RIFTED LIKE A WRALING BULB
Line_1975	TURNING IT TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_1976	THE LIGHT KEEPS ON PASHING OF OBJECTS BUT THE COLOR BLUE
Line_1977	UM IT'S RECECTING OH IS A BLUE OR ASOLTIER
Line_1978	NA HAVE THE THE OBSTRUCTION OF THE LINE
Line_1979	IT IT TURNS INTO THE BULB
Line_1980	IT'S SHARING SOME LONG YA THE LAND
Line_1981	ALSO THE LIGHT IS HERE BECAUSE OUR THE L
Line_1982	IT'S BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING INTO YEAH INSTEAD OF BLUE
Line_1983	IT WAS AND AND CANDSOLIN THERE HAD TO TO BE RED
Line_1984	WE WELL HAVE A REFLECTION THAT THE THAT'S SO
Line_1985	THAT CHANGED THE SCALE THE FIL TURN
Line_1986	YES THE REFLECTION IT'S A COLORS
Line_1987	THE REFLECTION WAS USED TO A MIXING THE COLOR
Line_1988	UHM IT WILL TEN DER
Line_1989	UM IT'S NOT USED TO THE COLOR BECAUSE IT HAS GREEN LIME AND IT'S POSTGREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
Line_1990	BECAUSE IT STOPS THE COLORS IT'S USED TO
Line_1991	IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS BRAT OR IT MUST BE RED
Line_1992	LAND THE RED
Line_1993	I AM DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU U
Line_1994	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS WITH WIRE AND BATTERY
Line_1995	T TWO GREEN WIRES ONE D CELL BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1996	BATTERIES ARE A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT IT STORES ELECTRICITY
Line_1997	WIRES MAKES A CIRCUIT CLOSED
Line_1998	THE GERM AN OPEN CIRCUIT IN TO A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1999	THAT THEY CONDUCT SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY TO THE TO THE BATTERY
Line_2000	I THINK ELECTRICITY TRAVELS AND WE
Line_2001	WIRES CARRY OPEN CIRCUITS
Line_2002	LIGHT BULBS HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_2003	A LIGHT BULB HAS EIGHT DIM
Line_2004	I THINK IT MEANS TO FOR A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER THAT IT MEANS LIKE A RECEIVES ELECTRICITY TO LIGHT UP THE
Line_2005	THAT THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE THE CASING WIRE THE LIGHT BULB
Line_2006	LIKE I SEE I SEE ELECTRICITY THAT
Line_2007	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE
Line_2008	THE ELECTRICITY IS BLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2009	THE END OF THE BATTERY IS FLOWING TO THE CIRCUIT WIRE THE
Line_2010	THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB GOING TOWARDS THE BATTERY DI D CELL BATTERY
Line_2011	THE BLUE DOESN'T PRESENT THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_2012	THE D CELL BATTERY SLIPPED OVER
Line_2013	FIRE BULBS
Line_2014	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_2015	THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRE SO THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP IN TO THE FIL
Line_2016	I THINK THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT IF YOU TOUCHED THE BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE BASE
Line_2017	THAT WHEN EVERY TIME THE WIRE TOUCHES THE CASING WIRE THE BULB LIGHTS AND WHEN BOTH OF THE WIRES TOUCH THE BASE IT DOESN'T L
Line_2018	IT'S LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT
Line_2019	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2020	THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE B
Line_2021	THE BATTERY GIVES THE MOTOR ENERGY AND MAKES THE MOTOR STICKY
Line_2022	IT HAS A SWITCH MAKING THE MOTORS STOP
Line_2023	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED IS
Line_2024	IT CONNECT TO THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_2025	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_2026	THE MOTOR IS ON IT MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2027	THE WHOLE CIRCUIT BECOMES
Line_2028	THE SWITCH HAS TO TOUCH THE WIRES
Line_2029	THE MOTOR STOPS AND I MOVE
Line_2030	THE SWITCH IS IN IT NOT CLOSER
Line_2031	THE ELECTRICITY HAS STICK ROSE TO WIRE TO THE BATTERY AND THEN TO THE MOTE
Line_2032	WHEN THEY GET SOLAR ENERGY THEY POWER ST
Line_2033	SUNLIGHT IS TRAVELING TO THE TO THE SOLAR PANEL INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG S SPIN
Line_2034	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKES IT SPIN
Line_2035	THE SOLAR PANEL IS RECEIVING SUNLIGHT
Line_2036	THE FLAG WOULD STOP SPIN
Line_2037	WHEN THEY CLICK ON THE SUN THE LA STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_2038	THE SOLAR FUEL IS NOT RECEIVING ENTER A ANY ENERGY AND THE STOPPING THE MOTOR SPA
Line_2039	IT IS SHOWING ENERGY TRANSFORMING FROM THE WIRE TO THE SMALLER
Line_2040	THEY'RE DOING FINE PINK
Line_2041	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO BUILD PARALLEL AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2042	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2043	THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH POWER BY ONE D CELL BATTERY
Line_2044	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_2045	THE LIGHT BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_2046	I
Line_2047	COMES IT COMES T
Line_2048	DCODCODRODS OVER TO CONE
Line_2049	WA
Line_2050	E ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2051	I NOTICED THAT THERE IS TWO PATHWAY
Line_2052	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS GOING IT'S GOING
Line_2053	BODY THE WINGS HAD TO PULCHUTD AND TU CLAIRIS A CLING
Line_2054	BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE LIGHT BULB HAS TO STOP AND GO WHEN IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT WET DIMMER
Line_2055	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO ENERGY HAS TO TRAVEL LONGER THEN IT WILL SUPPORT
Line_2056	BATTERIES
Line_2057	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT DON'T HAVE TO CALL THAT
Line_2058	I AM DOING F
Line_2059	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING TO SOLVE THE STREAM OF LIGHT PROB
Line_2060	IT HAD A CAR STREET TO LIGHTS O STRENGS OF WIT
Line_2061	THE BULB IS NOT LIGHTING BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2062	ON SHI MEAN
Line_2063	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB TURN OFF
Line_2064	THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_2065	BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE MORE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEY BOTH DON
Line_2066	OP
Line_2067	THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BRIGHTS OUT AND NO MORE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER
Line_2068	THEN ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOW
Line_2069	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2070	THE OTHER BULB STAYS SLIGHT LIT BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IS CONNECTED TO TH
Line_2071	THE OTHER BULB AND LIT
Line_2072	WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE TURNS T
Line_2073	BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT AND WHEN THE OTHER BULB LU BURNS OUT THE OTHER MULT
Line_2074	AND LABLE BLAH BUBBLOWE
Line_2075	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW MAGNETS INTRRACT WITH EACH OTHER
Line_2076	THE TWO BRIM MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2077	I THINK THE MAGNETS WOULDN'T REPEL INCE THE OF ATTRACT
Line_2078	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_2079	OPPOSITE FOILS ATTRACT AND AND MATCHING PARTS DON'T E
Line_2080	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS HAVE SOUTH SIDE THEY ARE CONNECTING TO THE D
Line_2081	THE OPPOSITE PULLEYS
Line_2082	THE COMPACT IS WAITING MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS MOVING
Line_2083	I AM DOING FINE THANK
Line_2084	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS AND HOW THEY WORKS
Line_2085	MAGNETIC FIELD IS SOMETHING THAT'S A NAIL AND WE CAN
Line_2086	MAGMEIZ AND ROPS B OR A BUT AND THEY DON'T ONLY ONE OF SALT
Line_2087	THE MAGNET IS IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_2088	THE MAGNET ONLY GOES THROUGH THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND NOT THROUGH THE
Line_2089	THOUGH IT'S OWN
Line_2090	THE MEN IS TACTIC WITH THE NAIL AND ALLOWING THE PAPER CLIP TO STICK TO THE NA
Line_2091	THE MAGNET IS INTERACTING WITH THE NAIL ALLOWING MAGNETISM TO RUN THROUGH THE NAIL AND S STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2092	COAL WARNS
Line_2093	MAG THE MAGNETISM DOESN'T RUN THROUGH THE NAIL IT
Line_2094	PROBABLY A F WE SECONDS
Line_2095	THE NAIL IS GETTING MAGNETIC OR LETTING THE CLIP STICKS TO IT
Line_2096	BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCES REMOVED FROM THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP FALLS
Line_2097	IT'S SHOWING ME HOW THE MAGNETISM RUNS TO THE NAILS
Line_2098	WE HAVE TO
Line_2099	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2100	YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT ON THE
Line_2101	WHEN YOU HA AND IT ALSO WORKS BY RAPPING AROUND THE M
Line_2102	THE RIVET IS CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE SWITCH IS MAKING IT A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO IT IS AN ELECTRO MAG

Line_2110	WHEN IT CUPS IT WON'T BE
Line_2111	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW THEY TRAVEL
Line_2112	THE LIGHT BULB IS TURNING ON AND THE BO IS
Line_2113	BUT I REFLEX LIGHT AND IT Y
Line_2114	UH LIGHT SHALL DISSOVLE THE HOW HOW FAR IT'S HEEL
Line_2115	IT BOUNCES OFTEN AS IT GOES
Line_2116	THE LIGHT ELSES OFF THE OBJECT
Line_2117	IT POUNCES OFF THE END OF
Line_2118	THE H UGLY BULLY IS SEEING THIS REFLECTION
Line_2119	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE HERE AND IT IS REFLECTING TO
Line_2120	A REFLECTION MAKES THE THE LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH THE METERS AND THEN IT EATS THE STARS AND THE LIGHT
Line_2121	THE LIGHT GETS REFLECTED OFF THE MER AND THE MER WIGS THE LIGHT
Line_2122	THE THE REFLECTION OF THE PENCIL IS GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND IT LOOKS THAT THIS TWO PENCILS
Line_2123	THE WATER REFLECTS THE PENCIL AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO ONES THAT
Line_2124	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REFLECTION AND HOW THE LIGHT CLIPS CETAL METERS S
Line_2125	I AM COLD AND WEAK TODAY THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNI I
Line_2126	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS AND HOW THEY
Line_2127	THEY ALL
Line_2128	THE LIGHT IS SHINING TO AS DIRECTION
Line_2129	I AM WEAK AND SICK THANK GIVE FOR ASKING MARNIE
Line_2130	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEEING COLORS AND THE HOW
Line_2131	I AM COLD AND WEAK THANK YOU FOR ASKING MARNIE
Line_2132	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT COLORS
Line_2133	THE LIGHT IS ALL YELLOW AND IS MAKING ENERGY OUT OF IT
Line_2134	THE WHITE LIGHT CAN COME FROM THE SUN NO
Line_2135	I COULD SEE THREE SOURCES OF WEIGHT LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_2136	THE LIGHT IS SHINING INTO THE PRISM AND THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE LIGHT THE WHIT LIGHT INTO ITS CALL
Line_2137	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE WIDE LIGHT AND TO IT'S DIFFERENT COL
Line_2138	THE PRISM IS SEPARATING THE WHIGHT LIGHT INTO IT'S ORIGINAL COLORS
Line_2139	IT'S TO THE PRISM AND THE PRISM SEPARATES THE COLORS AND IT'S REAL
Line_2140	I I SEE ALL SEVEN COLORS OF THE RAIN
Line_2141	IT MAKES ARE COLORS OF THE
Line_2142	I THINK THERE ARE SEVEN COLORS IN
Line_2143	THE WHITE LIGHT IS GETTING OBSORBED TO THE WHITE PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE WHITE LITER IS REFLECTING IT
Line_2144	BECAUSE IT FALLS DOWN
Line_2145	THE WHIT LIGHT GETS TURNED TO BLUE LIGHT AND THE WHIT PART OF THE BULB GETS OBSORBED
Line_2146	THE WHITE LIGHT IT'S GETTING OBSORBED BY THE WHITE PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE BLUE PART OF THE BULB IS GETTING WITH FLAT
Line_2147	GOOD TO B SOME MONEY GET THE BOSS
Line_2148	THE WEIGHT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE AND THEN MAKES THE BULB BLUE AND THE WEIGHT POT STICK'S WHIT
Line_2149	THE WHITE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE YELLOW BULB IT IS MAKING THE BULL YELL
Line_2150	BALLS ARE BORN TO PLAY WITH AND THE BALL IS MAKING IT YELLOW BECAUSE THE WIRE IS PACKING ON IT
Line_2151	BULL MAKES YELLOW AND THEN BULL MAKES IT WHITE BECAUSE A WHITE SPOT AND YELLOW
Line_2152	THE PLATFORM IS TURNING ON TO BLOOD AND RED IS TURNING A HI
Line_2153	THE BOMB TURNS GREEN
Line_2154	THE BULTERNED GREEN BECAUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT MAKES THE BLUE FILTER INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE YELLOW BUL
Line_2155	GHTONLY THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE THE LIGHTER
Line_2156	THE LIGHT ISN'T REFLECTING OFF IT AND THE LIGHT IS T
Line_2157	WHEN YOU SHINE THE LIGHT ON THE BRICKS IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2158	YOU WOULD SIGHT THE RED LIGHT ON THE
Line_2159	HEY WE CALLED THEM A D CELL BATTERY A BATTERY AND ENERGY WIRES
Line_2160	BATTERIES PRODUCE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS POWERS AND MOVE
Line_2161	THE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT TRAVEL ENERGY THROUGH THEM TO GIVE POWER TO AN OBJECT THAT IT IS SO
Line_2162	IN A CIRCUIT WIRES CARRY ENERGY
Line_2163	SO THE BATTERY PA GETS IT'S POWER AND IT LIGHT SO THE BATTERY IS LIKE A LIGHT
Line_2164	A RECEIVER MEANS IT IS GETTING AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING FROM ANYTHING
Line_2165	TO ME IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S TRAVELING TO THE LIGHT FROM BECAUSE OF A WIRE ELECTRICITY WIRE
Line_2166	THE NEGATIVE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2167	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ENERGY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2168	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2169	I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STARTED TO GO THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS CLOAKQUISED
Line_2170	UH DIRECTION OF FLOW TURNS THE OTHER WAY
Line_2171	THIS FACING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2172	I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS WORKING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_2173	I THINK THAT THE ENERGY WOULD GO JUST GO NOWHERE AND IT WOULD STOP AND THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD NOT LIGHT
Line_2174	I NOTICED THAT AT FIRST THE BULB DID NOT LIGHT AND WHEN WE CLICKED THE BUT AND THAT THE WITH THE WIRE MOVED THEN IT THE LIGHT BULB D
Line_2175	IN SCIENCE LATELY WE HAVE BEEN DOING CLOSED CIRCUITS AND OPEN CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORKS
Line_2176	IT'S ME IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THAT IT MEANS TO MOVE
Line_2177	IT MUST GET ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY SO THAT IT WILL MO
Line_2178	THAT IT MUST GET ENERGY SO IT MA
Line_2179	THE BATTERY IS TRANSFERRING IT'S ENERGY AND THEN IT MOVES SO THAT IT W
Line_2180	NOTICED THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER WIRES SO IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY JUST STOPS SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_2181	IS THAT THERE IS ENERGY TRAVELING FROM BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY SWITCH WAS UP STICK AND THEN A REAL
Line_2182	I I NOTICE THAT I DON'T
Line_2183	IT HAS TO HAVE LIGHT FROM THE SUN SO THAT IT WILL MOVE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO LIGHT IT HAS NO ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR MO
Line_2184	FLAG IS TURNING IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR PANEL NO SOLAR PANEL GETS ITS ENERGIES FROM THE SUN AND THEN IT JUST LIKE MOVES THOUGH THE WIRES
Line_2185	I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS SAVING
Line_2186	THINK CAN IT CAN STILL PRODUCE ENERGY ON A CLOUDY DAY I JUST THINK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS ON THE BRIGHT AND SUNNY
Line_2187	THE FLAG WILL START TO MOVE BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR CELL AND THEN I IT JUST MOVES AND IT GOES
Line_2188	MAKES THE FLAG BLUE WELL WELL WELL
Line_2189	IT'S THAT WHEN THERE IS NO SO THAT THE FLAG WILL NOT MOVE
Line_2190	THAT THERE IS NO ENERGY TRAVELING FROM THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN BUBBUBBUBBBLACK HAT
Line_2191	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT AND THERE IS JUST CAN IN SOLATORS AND THIS E THAT
Line_2192	HAVING CONDUCT THIS HELPS SEND ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR SO THEN IT'S ABLE TO SPIN THE FLAG
Line_2193	IN THE CIRCUIT A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO POWER A MOTOR
Line_2194	CONDUCTORS ARE WHAT CONDUCT THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE SO THEN AGAINST THE MOTOR POWER TO SPIN
Line_2195	OOD
Line_2196	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_2197	FOUND OUT THAT THE BRASS RING WORKS
Line_2198	IT IT'S AN INSULATOR ON IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THE AN INSULATOR WILL NOT LET ENERGY FLOW THROUGH OR TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_2199	THE THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS A CONDUCTOR AND ENERGY CAN IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH IT
Line_2200	CONDUCTORS ARE OBJECTS THAT OR ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THEM WITH AND THE MOTOR WILL STILL SPIN IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER WIRES
Line_2201	WE HAVE IS A BOUT PRESENT ENERGY
Line_2202	I BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO MAKE STUFF
Line_2203	I DON'T KNOW WHAT FIELDS OR
Line_2204	A CANDLE LIT ON FIRE AND IT RELATES TO ENERGY BECAUSE IT IS ENERGY
Line_2205	OBSERVE WHEN I SEE A CAN NOT BURN IF
Line_2206	BURNING A CANDLE GIVES OFF ENERGY
Line_2207	NO I DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING WHEN A CANDLE BURNS
Line_2208	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER BECAUSE IT IS FULL AND IT IS GETTING USED
Line_2209	YOU CAN SEE HEAT OR YOU CAN FEEL HEAT
Line_2210	ENERGY IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEY ARE USING THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR BODY TO PUT THE DRUM
Line_2211	SHE IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING ENERGY FROM HER APPLE AND THEN SHE IS USING HER ENERGY ON HER WALK
Line_2212	YES YOU CAN HEAR THE DRUMS BEING PLAYED BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INSTRUMENT AND THEY ARE MADE TO MAKES NOISE
Line_2213	WE SEE A LAW OF SOURCES OF ENERGY
Line_2214	I SEE SOLAR PANELS APPLES A BAR TREE PIECES COAL AND FEW
Line_2215	THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BAD BECAUSE WE ARE RELEASING BAD GASSES IN TO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2216	WE IT MAKES THE AIR ALL IT IT GIVES OFF BAD GASSES TO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2217	IT IS ALL DARK AND SMOKEY
Line_2218	I SEE DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES I SEE GOOD ONES AND BAD ONES
Line_2219	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT LEAVING A BAD GASSES IN THE AIR
Line_2220	THEY BOTH PRODUCE ENERGY AND THEY DO NOT AND NEITHER OF THEM PRODUCE BAD GASSES INTO THE I
Line_2221	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO LEAVE BAG GASSES IN THE AIR AND THEY THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES
Line_2222	I THINK THAT COAL AND GAS ONE DAY WILL RUN OUT AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE LEFT TO
Line_2223	THEY WILL HAVE BAD BAD EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY POLLUTE BAD GASSES INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2224	A RENEWABLE ENERGY CIRCLES ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ONE DAY THAT WE ONLY HAVE THEM NOW
Line_2225	I I AM DOING GOOD
Line_2226	WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2227	E ELECTRICITY CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_2228	OR THE BULB TO LIGHT THE THE WIRES ARE FLING ENERGY FROM THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE GO INTO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_2229	TO GET ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB THE D CELL SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_2230	IT IS GETTING ENERGY A RIVERS CO PATHWAY AND THEN IT M
Line_2231	UM NO YEAH YEAH B YEAH B
Line_2232	IN A SERIES CIRCUIT PATHWAYS THERE CAN BE AS MANY AS TO UP TO AS MANY AS A MILLION
Line_2233	AND MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET H
Line_2234	OUR D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS GET LIGHTER AND THE WE BRIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY
Line_2235	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING PARALLEL C
Line_2236	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE UM THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT B
Line_2237	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE D CELL BETTER
Line_2238	D THERE ARE FOR PATHWAYS
Line_2239	I OBSERVED ENERGY IS MOVE IN
Line_2240	COMPARED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE BRIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT
Line_2241	BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING MORE LIKE CHUMPS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL YOU'LL GET MORE D
Line_2242	WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2243	I I REMEMBER THAT IT ALWAYS GOES LIKE IN ONE SIDE AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2244	IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PATH THE OR TWO PATHWAYS OR MORE IT MATTERS HOW MANY LIKE WELL
Line_2245	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLVING C
Line_2246	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE STRING OF LIGHT
Line_2247	UM TO USE UM YOU CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS A
Line_2248	UM YOU CAN USE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WILL A ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT THAT CAN COMPLETE THIS C
Line_2249	BECAUSE THE I THINK THAT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THAT LIKE LIGHT BULB SO IT DOESN'T KEEP FLOWING
Line_2250	THE LIGHT BULB THAT IS BROKE AND THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2251	THE ENERGY STOPS RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE FILM BROKE SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE
Line_2252	SO THE FILAMENT BRAKES IT ON ONE OF NEITHER OF THE LIGHT BUL
Line_2253	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2254	WE HAVE ALSO SEEN UHM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL
Line_2255	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_2256	UM ONLY A NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE WILL STICK TOGETHER
Line_2257	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FI
Line_2258	THE NAILS ARE THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT NAIL IS IRON
Line_2259	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAG OR THE NAIL IS STEEL OR IRON SO SO THE MAGNET ATTRACTS IT
Line_2260	UMLY IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY METAL S STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2261	MAGNETS STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR ST
Line_2262	A NAIL MUST BE MADE OF ALUMINUM
Line_2263	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS CERTAIN KINDS OF METALS AND THE OTHER NAIL MUST BE ALUMINIUM SO IT IS NOT ATTRACTING TO THE MET
Line_2264	IT IS STEEL OR IRON THAT WILL ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET
Line_2265	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_2266	I THINK THAT THE STEEL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE ALUMINIUM IS LIKE NOT A STRONG MET
Line_2267	I NOTICED THAT ONLY USUALLY THE METALS ON OR OBJECTS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2268	I I THINK IT HAS STEEL OR IRON
Line_2269	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2270	T STICK
Line_2271	I THINK THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR S
Line_2272	UM WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS AND A
Line_2273	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE EITHER TWO NORTH POLES OR SOUTH POLES TRAINING EACH OTHER
Line_2274	UH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO SOUTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO NUSTPULS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER MAN
Line_2275	THEY UM LIKE RAN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2276	THE MAGNETS ARE RE REPELLING EACH OTHER THEN PUSHING AWAY FROM EACH
Line_2277	I THINK THIS MIXTURE IS BECAU-
Line_2278	SHE IS TRYING TO SEE WHICH DIRECTION SHE IS GOING
Line_2279	AND BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MAKE THE COMPASS NO WHICH WEIGH THEY'RE FACING
Line_2280	IT IS BECAUSE THE BY DICK
Line_2281	THE NAIL IS OUR TEMPORARY MAGNET T
Line_2282	OHH IT WAS RECORDING ME
Line_2283	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_2284	THE MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THERE IS A NOT A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN
Line_2285	YOU I CAN SEE THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS WEAKER
Line_2286	THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_2287	THEY DO NOT HAVE STRONG ENOUGH FORCE TO ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO FAR APART
Line_2288	THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT YOU NEED GETS SMALLER
Line_2289	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2290	AND ELECTRO MAGNET IS A MAGNET THAT HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_2291	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_2292	I NOTICED THAT IT IS A CLOSE CIRCUIT AND IT INCLUDES THE SWITCH BUT IT ALSO HAS A D CELL YOU HAVE ENERGY
Line_2293	WITH OUT THE ENERGY THEN IT WILL NOT BE AN ELECTROMAGNET MAGNET AND THE RIVET WILL NOT ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_2294	YOU NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STOPS UH AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2295	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN THE ENERGY WILL JUST STOP
Line_2296	THE ENERGY STOPS AND THE YOU MAGNET IS NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT ANY THING ANYMORE
Line_2297	UM THE FLOW THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WHERE FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_2298	M YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2299	I I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2300	IT- GOOD
Line_2301	THAT IS IT ISN'T A COMBINATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNET
Line_2302	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE MAGNET TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2303	THE THE WIRES IS DRAPED ABOUT THE RIVET AND IT ATTRACTS THE WASHERS
Line_2304	IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2305	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2306	YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS NO WASH WASHERS ATTACHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE CUP A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2307	IT DOES BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2308	YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE BOTTOM THAT IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRES AROUND STEEL RIVET
Line_2309	IF YOU ADD MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHES
Line_2310	CHANGES BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING AROUND THE RIVET AND IT IS GETTING MORE ENERGY SO IT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2311	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEI AND HOW IT TRAVELS
Line_2312	BECAUSE THIS LIGHT IS REFLECTING
Line_2313	YOU CAN IT REFLECTS IT CAN REFLECT AND KEEP IT CAN REFLECT ON TO SOMETHING
Line_2314	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON IN OFF AND IT IS REFLECTING
Line_2315	UH WITH OUT IT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DARK
Line_2316	IT UM REFLECTS OFF ON UM SOMETHINGS BUT SOME THINGS IT CAN NOT REFLECT AS WELL
Line_2317	IT REFLECTS OFF THE OBJECTS THAT IT HITS IN THE ROOM
Line_2318	YOU OBSERVED THE LIGHT REFLECT
Line_2319	AM THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING AND IT IS BOUNCING BACK AT THE STUDENT
Line_2320	IT CAN KEEP REFLECTING IF IF IT IS POSITION DRY AND THE LIGHT IT IS STRONG ENOUGH
Line_2321	I THINK THE FLASH LIGHT WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LEFT AND THE CORNER STAR BECAUSE OF HOW T
Line_2322	THE UM PENCILS REFLECTING BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENCIL IN THE WATER BUT THERE REALLY IS ONLY ONE
Line_2323	HE NOTICED THAT UH THE PENCIL REFLECTS OFF THE GLASS
Line_2324	AND THE GLASS WITH WATER IN IT IT IS REFLECTING AND THE WITH THE GLASS WITH AIR NOTHING IS HAPPENING
Line_2325	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT IS CAN EXPLAIN TWO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2326	ITS CAN COME FROM ENERGY
Line_2327	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE LIGHT LIGHT MAKES THE CANDLE GREEN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE ANY COLOR
Line_2328	YOU NOTICE THAT THE PRISM SPRITS SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE WHIGHT AND DIFFERENT FORMS
Line_2329	SEE THAT THE PRISM SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE WEIGHT
Line_2330	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT IS PUTS INTO SIX DIFFERENT COLORS AND IT IS THE COLORS OF THE RA
Line_2331	COULD NOTICE THAT UM IN A LIGHT BULB ALL THE COLORS ARE WHIGHT AND WHEN IT SWITCH INTO THE PRET PRISM IT SPLITS INTO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2332	I THINK THAT SIX DIFFERENT COLORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE WHIT LIGHT
Line_2333	YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS UM GOING TOWARDS THE BULB THAT IT IS WHIGHT LIGHT AND WHEN IT REFLECTS THE BULB THE LIGHT IS BLUE THAT REFLECT
Line_2334	UM THAT EVERY COLOR IS A WHIT IS ATTRACTING TO THE YELLOW BULB AND YELLOW IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB
Line_2335	THAT UM THE WEIGHT LIGHT IS ATTRACTING THE BULB AND UM THE YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTED OFF THE YELLOW L
Line_2336	UM YOU NOTICE THAT WHIGHT LIGHT IS HEADING THE BULB IN YELLOW LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF FROM THE B
Line_2337	THAT ON THE BLUE BALL BLUE LIGHT WOULD REFLECT LIT AND ON THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
Line_2338	YOU NOTICE THAT DIFFERENT OBJECTS CON TURNING TO DIFFERENT COLORS DEPENDING ON WHICH COLOR THE OBJECT IS
Line_2339	THE YELLOW BULB CHANGES INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE A DIFFERENT LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS
Line_2340	COLOR CHANGED AND IF IT IS A DIFFERENT OBJECT AND IT WILL NOT CHANGE INTO THAT COLOR IF IT IS A CERTAIN COLORED OBJEC
Line_2341	YOU THINK THAT ONLY SOME UHM COLORS LIGHT WILL CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE LINE
Line_2342	THE IT HAS YOU HAVE EVERY OTHER COLOR BESIDES GREEN UM TO TURN THE LIKE GREEN
Line_2343	THE COLOR RED BECAUSE UHM THE BRICK IS RED
Line_2344	UM IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UHM IT DOES NOT NEED THAT COLOR
Line_2345	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN SCIENCE ENERGY
Line_2346	A LETTER A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_2347	D CELL BY WIRES AND LIGHT BUL
Line_2348	UH THE WIRES COULD CONNECT TO A LIGHT VERY I MEAN TO LIGHT BULB AND SHINE WITH THE POWER
Line_2349	WIRE PASTHWAY
Line_2350	THE BATTERIES HAVE ENERGY AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE THINGS WORK
Line_2351	E YOU COULD LIGHT UP ANY
Line_2352	THE SOURCE UH WOULD GET ENERGY
Line_2353	THE PAST HAS I THINK
Line_2354	WIRES CARRY IN A CIRCUIT IS THEEGS THAT COULD CARRY US IN
Line_2355	IT LIGHT UPS COULD MAKE ANYTHING SHRIE
Line_2356	IT MEANS THAT WE LIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING WE
Line_2357	YOU COULD PUT SOME OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT AND THE BATTERY TO MAKE IT HIGH
Line_2358	I SEE UM THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LIGHT UP AND ABOUT THE BED TO MAKE THE LIGHT UP
Line_2359	UM ENERGY FROM A BRONDY IT'S GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO ER
Line_2360	IF YOU USE D CELL ENERGY WITH THE WIRES THE WIRES WILL GET ENERGY TO IT LIKE BULB
Line_2361	THE POSITIVE SIDE UM GETS THE ENERGY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES UM GIVE HIS ENERGY TO IT LIGHT
Line_2362	THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES SO LIKE UH AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE WIRE
Line_2363	ITS BLUE TOT REPRESENTS THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_2364	FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE TO GO TO A NEGATIVE SIDE IN
Line_2365	ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS WITH THE POSITIVE
Line_2366	S THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2367	IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE UM ONE AND ONE WIRE HAS BE CONNECTED TO THE A
Line_2368	THEY WON'T WORK IF THEY'RE ON THE BASE BUT IF THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WOULD WORK
Line_2369	I IT MEANS THAT THE YOU
Line_2370	ENERGY HAS TO METAL THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MET
Line_2371	E ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2372	IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2373	THE MOTOR WORKS
Line_2374	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2375	WHEN IT'S OPEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T MOVE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_2376	IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO OR
Line_2377	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2378	THE SUN HITS LITTLE SOLAR PANEL IS ENDED IN SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY TO WORK
Line_2379	THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING SO THERE IS A C
Line_2380	UH BECAUSE THE ENERGY GO S
Line_2381	THE FLAG WON'T MOVE BECAUSE THE SOLAR PEELS NADE SUNLIGHT
Line_2382	THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2383	THE MOTOR IS SCORKY
Line_2384	THE MORE WORTH BECAUSE OF THE SALT
Line_2385	THE SOLAR PONORS ARE ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM THE C
Line_2386	WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SPLIT
Line_2387	THERE IS IT BETTER WIRES A MOTOR A NAIL AND A SWI
Line_2388	S SWITCH AND THE NAIL
Line_2389	LISTED PAPER CLIPS MOTOR USED WORKING
Line_2390	WITH THE SPUNGENT WON'T WORK
Line_2391	SO TH ARE MADE R COPPER IRON
Line_2392	SOME OF THEM MA
Line_2393	THE MOTOR ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE S STICK IS WOOD
Line_2394	IT HAS IN CLOSED CIRCUIT IT HAS WOOD BUT NOT STEEL THE RIGHT A
Line_2395	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S A
Line_2396	I IT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS
Line_2397	BECAUSE THE STRAW IS RUBBER
Line_2398	THE BRASS SWING GREEN THAT WOOD SPILL JUST LIKE COPPER AND COPPER LIKE METAL
Line_2399	THE CIRCUIT STOPS THE MOTOR STOPS B
Line_2400	SETTLE ENERGY UM WE WON'T LIVE
Line_2401	A A CANDLE
Line_2402	UM THE CANDLE HAS ENERGY FROM THE FIRE SO
Line_2403	IT'S IT WAS HE
Line_2404	ENERGY TEN
Line_2405	THE ENERGY IS LIKE THE SOURCE
Line_2406	YES I HEAR IT LIGHT SO I
Line_2407	IT'S STARTED TO FLAME UP
Line_2408	I I COULD SEE UH
Line_2409	YOU EAT ENERGY BY HITTING THE DR
Line_2410	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE YEAH IT S
Line_2411	I SEE ENERGY THE APPLES THE CANDLES THE WOOD AND THE GASOLINE
Line_2412	THE A IS GETTING THIRTY E YEAH
Line_2413	IT IT'S YEAH
Line_2414	UH THE SORT OF POWERS ARE GETTING ENERGY AND AFTER THE DRY AS IS GOING TO THE MODE AND THE ORDOR IS MA
Line_2415	UM THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ENERGY AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ENERGY LIKE CARS YEAH OF
Line_2416	REANEWE UH I
Line_2417	CARS AND TRAINS USED GUESSES AND COAL TO WORK
Line_2418	OH IT WOULD BURN ON THE NA WE'RE GET A FI INTO
Line_2419	CAR THE SHREEDS
Line_2420	IT'S BECAUSE WITH SETTLE ENERGY WE WERE ALL D
Line_2421	IT'S IS THINGS THAT GO TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK WITH ENERGY
Line_2422	ENERGY HAS TO GO LE TO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL BUT
Line_2423	UM THE D CELL HAS ENERGY THAT GOES THE FARTHER DIE SIDES OR ON
Line_2424	IT'S GOING IN FROM THE POSITIVE SLIGHT AND COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SLIGHT AND GOING IN THE TO LIGHT BULBS
Line_2425	THOSE ARE THE ENERGY SO
Line_2426	THE BLUE BIG DUST ARE ENERGY THAT GOES IN TO LIGHT BULB AND AND TO THE WIRES UN
Line_2427	THE FROM THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN A
Line_2428	IT ALSO UH BECAUSE
Line_2429	THERE IS FROM THE WIRES IT DEPENDS ON THE WATER
Line_2430	I THINK THE BUMBS WON'T BE THAT MUCH BRIGHT
Line_2431	THE LIGHT BULBS WON U SHINE THAT MUCH ANY MORE
Line_2432	THE LIGHT BOMBS WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH LIGHT AND THEN SO THERE BE SO BRIGHT AND IT
Line_2433	OH THAT'S TWO D CELLS ABOUT THE LIGHT BULBS GET DRIGHTER AND WITH ONE THE LIGHT BUMBS ARE THAT BRIGHT
Line_2434	THERE NEEDS TO BE A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE TO ARELOFLON L
Line_2435	LITERS
Line_2436	UH WE ARE DOING A PEE BAL ON SOLAR PANELS AND HOW WORK
Line_2437	THE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2438	BIT SHARES IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_2439	THERE ARE A PEN SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2440	THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEY SHARE ENERGY AND THIS SERIES CIRCUIT DO NOTHING WE'RE NOT
Line_2441	PARONELNCIIC
Line_2442	THAT THEY CIRCUITS YEAH YEAH A MET
Line_2443	THE THE LIGHT BUMPS CORE BURN OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY
Line_2444	UM THEY ARE
Line_2445	IT IS A PARONLEL UM A
Line_2446	THEY PUT ALL ITS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE BUT NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2447	YES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS WARNING OUT BECAUSE IT HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND AND THE ONE'S OF HAVE THEM I DOUBT THAT ONE'S A
Line_2448	IT'S IT'S ONE
Line_2449	THE PARTS
Line_2450	CLUD
Line_2451	WE AM LEARNING IN SCIENCE AH WE ARE DOING UP PEA ONE SCIENCE
Line_2452	BECAUSE IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2453	IT WOULD BE CAUSE WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2454	STRINGS OR LIGHTS ARE
Line_2455	NO A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT WOULD WORK
Line_2456	THE LIGHT THE OTHER LIGHT UH WON'T WORK
Line_2457	ONE OF E
Line_2458	THE ENERGY DOESN'T UM GO IT DOESN'T FIL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB ANYMORE
Line_2459	ITS WELL
Line_2460	IT IS NOT AND IT IS A STAY CLOSE CIRCUIT
Line_2461	I NOTICE THAT THEN UP THAT IT FORMS ARE BRAKING BECAUSE OF SHARING ENERGY
Line_2462	H IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT
Line_2463	THAT UM THE FIRST ONE IT'S IT SHOWS HOW IT BRAKES AND THE SECOND ONE SHOWS HOW IT
Line_2464	IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE IF ONE OF THEM IS BROKEN THEN THE OTHER LIGHT WOULD WON'T WORK BECAUSE THE ENERGY AND UM OUR
Line_2465	BECAUSE THE LIGHT UM UM IS THE ONE THAT IS
Line_2466	E NEXT CID BARNY
Line_2467	THEY ARE MAGNETS
Line_2468	RELYGIL STICKS CHEAT ARE FIGURED LITER
Line_2469	ITS COULD
Line_2470	ARE THE MAGNETS STICKS TO THE REFRIGERATOR
Line_2471	MAGNETS COULD STICK ON TO ANYTHING THAT'S INS
Line_2472	MAKES IT CORRECT TO ANOTHER MAGNETS OR ELSE UM STEEL
Line_2473	WITHIN
Line_2474	THE BAND IT STICK TO IS TRACTING TO THE ET
Line_2475	WIDE'S STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL HOW RE I GOT HURT Y
Line_2476	THE MAGNET ORNITRICSHODON NOW BECAUSE IT IS LIKE STEEL AND THE WHAT IS
Line_2477	WOKEN WARS THROUGH SOME SIX RU MAGNETS IRON AND STEEL BUT NOT COLPER NO OTHER MAGNET
Line_2478	ALL STICK TO MAGNETS THE MAGNET AND THEN THE NAIL IS I OR STEEL AND THEN THE WHAT IS IT
Line_2479	THE BULBS HAVE IRON I'LL DE
Line_2480	MAGNET STICKS TO IRON
Line_2481	IT STICKS TO IRON NAILS AND MORE BUT NOT WOOD
Line_2482	SOME NAILS CAN BE COVERS AL YOU CAN LIFT UP THE YOU CAN LIFT IT UP WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2483	WHERE DIFFERENT ABOUT D NAILS ARE ONE OF THEM IS STEEL OR MELT IRON AND ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2484	EACH NAIL ONE OF THE NAILS IS NOT STICKING UP BUT ONE IS
Line_2485	ONE OF THE NAIL MIGHT BE STEEL OR I AN THAT ONE MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2486	POSE IT YEAH
Line_2487	UH NO
Line_2488	I THEN JUST STEEL OR SHE IS STICKING UM THROUGH THEM
Line_2489	ITS THREE OF THEM DON'T STICK BEFORE DO STICK
Line_2490	IT WON'T STICK OR
Line_2491	YEASTS
Line_2492	I THINK IT'S IS STEEL
Line_2493	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_2494	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE A TIP OF IRON THAT STICK UM TO MAGNETS
Line_2495	ITS MY HAVE IRON
Line_2496	UH WON'T GO BO OF IRON DIDN'T AND HELP THE LITS
Line_2497	THE MAGNET IS STICKING ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS NO SONG SALT
Line_2498	THE POLE IT'S GOING AWAY THE MAGNET IS GOING WAIT BECAUSE
Line_2499	EITHER FACING SOSNUMBS NOT SOUTHS
Line_2500	IT TAKE UM THAT TELLS YOU WHAT'S NORTH AND SOUTH ARE A MAGNET
Line_2501	I FUNCTION BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTING THAT OTHER MAGNETS
Line_2502	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNET FIELDS
Line_2503	MAGNETS HIS L IT IS OF MAGNET
Line_2504	THEY ARE STILL STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2505	THE PAPER IS AND BETWEEN THE MAGNET IS GOING AND THE PAPER CLIP IS TOO
Line_2506	IT HAS TO WITH FLORRALS
Line_2507	IT'S THE WALL SAY ON
Line_2508	THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING ON THE THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2509	THE NAIL ISN'T GIVING IT DON'T GETTING FAR FROM THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_2510	IT IS SHOWING YOU THE FEELED AROUND THE N
Line_2511	THAT MAGNET HAD SO FIELDS AROUND IT
Line_2512	THE MAGNET HAS A FIELD AROUND IT AND THEN IT'S GOING TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2513	MAGNETIC FIEL
Line_2514	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE YOU NEED NINETY UNTIL THE BUNDLE WILL S R
Line_2515	MY IT'S WILL SEPARATE AND THE AH GOES TO NINETEEN
Line_2516	THE MAGNETS ARE WITH THE FORCE ARE GETTING THE SPACERS
Line_2517	MAGNETS WOULD BE SEPARATE WOULD BE SEPARATE WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2518	IT'S A BATTERY SWITCH SOME WIRES A WIRE AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_2519	IT'S IT'S
Line_2520	YOUR NATURE USE A CLOTHED CIRCUIT FOR IT TO WORK
Line_2521	WHEN IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T WORK IT WILL IT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT STARTS GOOD
Line_2522	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THAT MEANS AT A FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IT WILL GO OUT TO NOWHERE
Line_2523	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T MORE BECAUSE IT'S GOING OFF TO MILTER AND THERE IS NO MAGNETS STICKING ON TO IT TO THE NE
Line_2524	IT WON'T WORKS
Line_2525	THERE ARE D CELL BATTERY WASHERS A SWITCH AND WATER AND A STEEL IT
Line_2526	IT A RUSTIC AND THE CRISCTHE CRISCTITDAL VAGADED
Line_2527	ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE BAND
Line_2528	THAT'S THE ELECTRICITY
Line_2529	BECAUSE THE RIVMETS ISN'T ELECT ISN'T A MAGNET AND SO THE ELECTRICITY IS A
Line_2530	YOU SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2531	IT'S APPORENT TO SAY THINGS BEAK
Line_2532	IT SOMETIMES IF IT HITS A METER IT REFLECTS HOW IT HITS YOUR EYE WHEN YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2533	THAT FRIGHT REFLECTS TO ANYTHING
Line_2534	THAT IT REFLEXS OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING
Line_2535	IF IT HITS ONE OF THE OPENS IN THE ROOM IT REFLECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_2536	IN THE RUB THE LIGHT REFLEXES TO S ALMOST ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WALL
Line_2537	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE LIGHT IN REFLECTION THROUGH THE MIRROR HAS BEEN GOING INTO THE PERSON'S EYE
Line_2538	WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT A PENCIL ITS IN THE WATER
Line_2539	WHEN IT IS LOWERED INTO THE WATER UM THE PENCIL MOVE
Line_2540	THAT THE LIGHT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT COULD MAKE THE PACE UM LIGHTER
Line_2541	HE THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM IS GOING FIRST IT'S WHIT
Line_2542	THE LIGHT GOES TO THE PRISM AND THEN IT'S RAMBLE CO
Line_2543	IT TURNED INTO A RAMBUE LIGHT COLOR
Line_2544	I SEE SEVEN CUNNERS
Line_2545	THEY ARE WEIGHT AND THEN THEY SPREAD ON TO OTHER S
Line_2546	EVEN
Line_2547	WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON IT REFLICTS TO THE BLUE BULB
Line_2548	WHEN IT'S BOUNCING OUT OF THE BULB THE BULB IS BLUE SO THE LIGHT IS TURNING BLUE WHEN IT HITS THE BLUE BULB
Line_2549	THIS IS REFLECT THING THROUGH THE BALL
Line_2550	INTO SHINING YET LE ONES ABOUT THROUGH THE W
Line_2551	THEY TURN RED OR A STOCK
Line_2552	YES BECAUSE IT WOULD TURN TO THE COLOR THAT OVEN IS UH DARKER
Line_2553	WHAT HAPPEN IS THAT THE LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH THE FILTER THAT IS MAKING IT BLUE WORLDS
Line_2554	IT WILL JUST THINK DIRECT
Line_2555	IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR SO THAT W
Line_2556	BECAUSE IT IS S
Line_2557	WHEN WHEN YOU HAD A SAP ON THE GREEN OR BLUE BUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE RED ONE IT
Line_2558	THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT WATER THAT IS SOLUTION
Line_2559	SOLUTE
Line_2560	THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE CAN MAKE A SALT WATER
Line_2561	A SOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIXTURES BECAUSE UM ONE ITEM HAS DISSOLVED INTO THE OTHER ITEM
Line_2562	THE SOLVED
Line_2563	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT CO SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT IT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER SO IT STILL ADDS WEIGHTS
Line_2565	IT IT'S ALL ADDED UP TO AND A NE WEIGHT
Line_2566	THE MASS IS GETTING GREATER
Line_2567	THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND IF YOU ADD THEM IT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_2568	THE WATER HAS AN FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT AND THEREFORE IT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2569	YOU CAN USE A COFFEE FILTER OR YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT
Line_2570	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2571	IT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL THE SAND CAN NOT MIX WITH THE THE WATER BECAUSE IT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_2572	ITS HAS TURNED INTO A MIXTURE
Line_2573	THIS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ASIDE HAS BLENDED INTO THE WATER
Line_2574	YOU HAVE TO DISSOLVED THE WATER
Line_2575	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT AND THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUTE
Line_2576	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_2577	IT THE WATER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2578	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE
Line_2579	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE S
Line_2580	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTE TO ITS SEPARATE
Line_2581	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES
Line_2582	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE USING A EVAPORATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT WITH A FILTER
Line_2583	THEY ARE USING A A MAGNET TO TAKE OUT THE PINS
Line_2584	THEY ARE SEPARATING GRAVEL AS ROCKS WITH A FILTER
Line_2585	GRAVEL AND WATER
Line_2586	O YOU CAN SEPARATE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_2587	TH GRAVEL IS BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER USING A SCREEN
Line_2588	THE MAGNET IS SUCKING UP THE LITTLE PENS WITH MAGNETI HE
Line_2589	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CANS CAN FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_2590	I NOTICED THAT THE WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS WERE IN THE MAGNETS PICKED THEM RIGHT UP BECAUSE THEIR MAGNETIC
Line_2591	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL GOT SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FIT THROUGH
Line_2592	BECAUSE THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH IT AND THE GRAVEL CANS
Line_2593	THIS IS THE BEST FOR USING EVAPORATION TO SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE WAT
Line_2594	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2595	TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU NEED A POWDER THAT CAN DISSOLVE INTO WATER
Line_2596	THE GREY POWDER IS GETTING PUT INTO THE WATER TO MAKES A SOLUTION
Line_2597	YOU CAN WEIGH IT WITH A SCALE OR YOU CAN SEE IT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2598	ONE SOLUTION HAS MORE GRA POWDER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2599	I SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE SCOOPS IN THE FIRST ONE AND THEN ONE SCOOP IN THE SECOND OR
Line_2600	YOU CAN WEIGH BOTH SOLUTIONS USING GRAMS AND THE ONE THAT WEIGHS MORE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2601	A SCALE
Line_2602	THE DIFFERENCE IN COLORS
Line_2603	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS USUALLY HAVE MORE POWDER
Line_2604	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THAN THE ONES WITH LIGHTER
Line_2605	THE LIGHTER COLORS SOLUTIONS ARE DILUTED
Line_2606	IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2607	I THINK IT WOULD TASTE STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE POWDER YOU HAVE THE STRONG NAIL BE
Line_2608	IT WOULD TASTE LIGHTER A AND MORE DILUTED
Line_2609	IT WOULD NOT BE AS STRONG AS THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAY POWDER
Line_2610	AT FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER TO THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2611	AD FIFTY MILLITERS OF WATER
Line_2612	YOU CAN ADD MORE POWDER OR ADDS MORE WATER
Line_2613	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2614	WE HAVE MADE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS AND COOLAIDES SOLUTIONS
Line_2615	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHTS TO THE WATER
Line_2616	THE ROCK IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FEATHER BECAUSE THE FEATHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_2617	ITS IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2618	ONE CUP HAS TEN ER TEN GRAMS MORE SOLUTE
Line_2619	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE SO IT THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2620	I WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE SOLUTE ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2621	ONE HAS TEN MORE GRAMS OF SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_2622	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE OF THE SOLUTE THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS AND IT WEIGHS LESS
Line_2623	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM
Line_2624	S SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2625	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2626	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTIONS THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2627	S SOLUTION B
Line_2628	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2629	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2630	IT'S DISSOLVING THE SALTS AND IT'S GETTING SATURATED
Line_2631	THE WATER IS GETTING I CONCENTRATED
Line_2632	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS A SATURATED
Line_2633	THAT MEANS THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE SALT IN TO IT
Line_2634	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED WITH SHOWER
Line_2635	IT CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2636	THIS SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2637	TH THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2638	WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE
Line_2639	THAT MEANS IT'S NOT SOLUBLE
Line_2640	THE POWDER IS A SOLUTE
Line_2641	YOU NEEDS A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT
Line_2642	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_2643	THE WATER IS GETTING SATURATED
Line_2644	THAT MEANS THE MA WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2645	THE EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2646	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURAT
Line_2647	THIS THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT SALT
Line_2648	IT LEAVES SOME OF THE SALT ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2649	ONE OF THE SIDE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT
Line_2650	WE'VE BEEN MAKING A SOLUTIONS AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_2651	EACH A SOLUTE EACH ONE OF THE THINGS IS SOL
Line_2652	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2653	SATURATING SOLUTIONS
Line_2654	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTIONS TOGETHER TO GET A PRODUCTS
Line_2655	IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2656	WE MIXED CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND THEN CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND CITRIC ACID AND THEN FINALLY BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
Line_2657	I THINK SO BECAUSE BAKING SODA WHEN IT HIT WHEN IT HITS WATER IT FIZZED
Line_2658	W WATER THE SOLVENT
Line_2659	THEY MIX TOGETHER AND SEPARATE
Line_2660	THEY ARE MIXED TO CREATE A NEW MOLECULES
Line_2661	THEY WILL MIX TOGETHER AND CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2662	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2663	THE SOLUTION HAS LEFT A PRECIPITATE
Line_2664	IT HAS MADE A NEW MOLECULES
Line_2665	THERE HAVE BEEN PURPLE MOLECULES CREATED IN THE WASTE
Line_2666	ITS CAN NOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF THE WATER
Line_2667	I SAW A
Line_2668	ITS GOT COLD
Line_2669	THE TWO MIXTURES THE TWO SOLUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT IS PICKED
Line_2670	YES BECAUSE THE PRODUCT TURNED PAINT
Line_2671	IT HAS MADE IT A
Line_2672	HE MADE A POOP IN THE BO
Line_2673	TON IT'S HA AND IT'S GETTING A
Line_2674	THERE IS A CHEMICAL THE I CAN
Line_2675	WENT INTO THE
Line_2676	ARE TO STICK AND
Line_2677	Y YES BECAUSE IT IS GLOWING
Line_2678	IT HAS MADE A CHEMICAL RE
Line_2679	YES BECAUSE THE GRAY THE WATER HAS TURNED PURPLE
Line_2680	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OR CURVING
Line_2681	TWO REACTANTS COMBINDING
Line_2682	IF- THERE IS A PRODUCT
Line_2683	THE PRODUCTS IS THE REMAINING THING AT THE BOTTOM
Line_2684	BAKING SODA AND A CHEMICAL CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2685	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2686	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL AND SOIL ROCKS AND SLAM FORMS
Line_2687	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_2688	WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOILS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2689	I SEE LOTS OF CLAY FELT GRAVEL AND HUMAN'S
Line_2690	HUMINS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2691	HUMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SALTS
Line_2692	THERE ARE THESE SOILS ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2693	THEY ARE ALL FOR DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2694	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2695	SAND CLAY GRAVEL PEBLES AND ORGANIC MATTER
Line_2696	ALL SOILS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT CLIMENTS
Line_2697	THEY BOTH THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WAIT REELS
Line_2698	THEY ARE SPREADED OUT T THROUGH THE GRAVEL
Line_2699	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE MOST OF THEM HAVE SAND
Line_2700	THE DELTA HAS MORE HUMANS AND MORE SAND AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A TINY BIT OF GRAVEL
Line_2701	IN THE DELTA THERE IS MORE SAND IN THE DESERT THERE IS A MORE GRAVEL THAN SAND
Line_2702	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS SOILS AND THE FOR
Line_2703	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STREAMS TABLES
Line_2704	THE STREAM TABLE WITH THE SLOPE HAS A BIGGER FAN THE ONE WITH OUT SLOPE HAS THE SMALLER FAN
Line_2705	A RIVER THAT IS STEEP IT FLOWS DOWN A RIVER THAT IS FLAT IT GOES SLOW
Line_2706	AND THE ONE WITH THE DEEP SNOW THERE THE WATER IS GOING FAST FOR THE IT THE FLAT IS GOING SLOW
Line_2707	THE WATER ON THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING SLOW AND THE WATER ON THE SL- STEEP SLOPE IS GOING FAST
Line_2708	THE FLOW OF THE WATERS GETS FASTER
Line_2709	ONE IT GUM IT MAKE BUBBLES
Line_2710	THE FLOOD CONDITIONS HAVE MAKE MORE CANIENS THAN THE STANDARD CONDITIONS
Line_2711	DURING A FLOUD THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_2712	ONES FASTER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_2713	IT PICKS UP AND STUDY'S GOING FASTER
Line_2714	IN TWENTY FOURTH AND THE FLUID HAS TAKEN DOWN TREES AND ROCKS FROM THE LAND
Line_2715	AN EARTHQUAKE
Line_2716	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS CRACKING BECAUSE OF WEATHER
Line_2717	CEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2718	THE ROCK HAS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS THAT IS CALLED PHYSICAL WETERING
Line_2719	THE ROCKS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS
Line_2720	I NOTICED THAT THE ROCK CAN WENT DOWN THROUGH WATER AND WAS STILL MOVING
Line_2721	THE RUSTS ARE BREAKING ARE GOING INTO THE ROCK AND ARE EXPANDING TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2722	WHEN WATER FILLS UP A CRACK IN THE ROCK AND IT FREEZES THEN THE THE ICE EX THE WATER EXPANDS AND CRACKS THE ROCK
Line_2723	WHEN WATER GETS INTO CRACK OF A ROCK IT FREEZES AND EXPANDS TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2724	THE WATER GOT INTO THE ROCK AND IT FROZE AND EXPANDED TO CRACKS THE ROCK
Line_2725	IT EXPANDS AND
Line_2726	THE FREEZING JAR HAS CRACKED THE ICE BECAUSE THE WATER HAS EXPANDED
Line_2727	THE WATER HAS EXPANDED AND BROKE THE GLASS
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE WATER EXPANDS
Line_2729	THE PILE OF ROCKS AT THE ON THE LEFT ARE PEBBLES AND THE AND THE ROCK IS ON THE RIGHT ARE GRAVEL
Line_2730	THE ONES ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_2731	WHETHER CHEMICAL WEATHERING
Line_2732	BECAUSE THE DELTA GRAVEL HAS HIT THE ROCKS GOING DOWN
Line_2733	WHAT'S GO ON GO TO BE IN OUR FRIDAY PRESSENTLY I AM THE YOU FORE
Line_2734	GOOD BYE THANK YOU I LOVE YOU WHEN YOU MAR
Line_2735	AROSIAM
Line_2736	I REALLY GOT UH THE BEDROOM
Line_2737	THERE IS WATER WITH A STEEP SLOPE AND WE THE WITH THAT IS FLOAT
Line_2738	ON THE ON THE STEEP SLOP THE WATER'S GOING FAST
Line_2739	I TOLD YOU ALL RE
Line_2740	THE FLUID IS GOING FAST CAUSING MORE EROSION DEPOSITION THAN NORMAL INSIDE
Line_2741	DURING THE FLUID THE WIRE'S GOING REALLY FAST WHEN IT'S NORMAL IT'S DOING NORMAL SPEED
Line_2742	DURING THE FLUID IT IS GOING REALLY FAST
Line_2743	IT HAD MORE ENERGY
Line_2744	LISTEN TO MY ICE
Line_2745	A VALCHANIC ERUPTIONS AND WHY IS IT GOING PERFECT
Line_2746	WHY DO I TAKE SO LONG TO TALK BACK
Line_2747	RAPID CHANGES
Line_2748	SLOWED
Line_2749	IT WAS A SLOW
Line_2750	LA H
Line_2751	LI
Line_2752	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MENETERS AND HOW LIGHT CAN REFLECT OFF IT
Line_2753	BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR THE THE ELECTRO MAGNETISM TO BE INDUCED
Line_2754	THE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET WHICH INDUCES ELECTRO MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES FAIL
Line_2755	IT PRODUCES MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES THE RIVET AN ELECTRO MAGNET WHICH IS AH WHICH ALLOWS IT TO PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_2756	IT IT INDUCES MAGNETISM BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HASN'T A A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2757	A THERE'S NO FLOW FOR ELECTRICITY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING THE WHOLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2758	A WELL THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT EITHER OPENS STOPS THE CIRCUIT OR COMPLETES IT
Line_2759	WELL WITHOUT ELECTRICITY ELECTROMAGNETS COULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ELECT IT INDUCES THE MAGNET
Line_2760	THE WIRES HAVE THERE HAS TO BE ENOUGH COILS WITH THE WIRE FOR IT TO INDUCE MAGNETISM
Line_2761	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPING AROUND THE RIVET WHICH IS INDUCING MAGNETISM AND THE WIND WHICH IS ALLOWING IT TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_2762	IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THOUGH THOSE ARE THE ONLY THING BESIDES MAGNETS AND MAGNETITE THAT CAN PICK UP MAGNET
Line_2763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND METERS
Line_2764	THE HOW YOU SEE THINGS IT'S LIGHT BOUNCES ALFFUL OF THEM WHICH AND THEY BOUNCES BACK TO YOUR EYES WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO SEE YOU IT
Line_2765	WELL WELL IT IS SHOWING IT AND IT'S BOUNCING BACK TO THE IS AND I'M STUCK IN ABOUT IT BALAN AT
Line_2766	IT BALANCES WOLVES
Line_2767	UM YOU SEEN SOMETHING
Line_2768	UM WHEN IT HITS THE OBJECT IT BOUNCES BOAT CUP
Line_2769	THERE IS A GLASS
Line_2770	MORNING ABOUT METERS AND WE S AND ELCHUM HANETS
Line_2771	THEY'RE ALL HAVE LIKE THIS WALL RIGHT THINGS SHINING AWAY AND A
Line_2772	WASH THE LIGHT ON CANDLES LIGHT BULB'S
Line_2773	THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH WHICH US BRAKING IN THE LIGHT LIGHT UP INTO EACH COLOR WHIT ARE ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2774	THERE IT'S WHIGHT LIGHT THROUGH TO THE CRYSTAL AND OUT IT'S THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2775	IF THE WHITE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH IT IS WHIGHT UNTIL I HAD S WHERE IT HUN TO ALL THE COLORS THE RAINBOW
Line_2776	WELL YOU LIGHT HITTING THE BLUE WALL AND IT'S BOUNCING OUT AS A BLUE LIGHT
Line_2777	ONE INCH IT'S GOING TOWARD HITTING THE BULB LIGHT BANDS COMING OFF IT'S LONG
Line_2778	WHEN THE LIGHT KIT THE WEIGHT LIGHT GETS IN EVERY COLOR BLUE IS ABSORBED SO THE BLUE CUPPER FLOWS OUT
Line_2779	IT'S ONLY COLLAR NOT GETTING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BULL
Line_2780	THE LIGHT WELL CENT IT'S NOT EQULAS BUT IT'S REFLECTING AROUND THE WALL AND THERE'S COMING ATTALS BLUE
Line_2781	IT'S OUBSORBED WITH THE BLUE WHAT IS GUTS ABOUT REFLECTED
Line_2782	LIKE THE OTHER BULB IT'S THEY BOND OFF AS YEAH BECAUSE EVERY OTHER COLORS BEING OBSERVED TO PUT YELLOW
Line_2783	THAT NOT ALL OF THEM THEY'RE SHOWING THE BULBS ARE COMING BACK
Line_2784	WALLS REFLECTING BLUE AND THE YELLOW BULBS ARE FILING YELLOW LIGHT
Line_2785	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FILTERING WEIGHT AND THE E IT'S GETTING FILTER BY THIS RED SHEET
Line_2786	THE NOT CARDS PLACED BEHIND THE FILTER IT TURNS AND BUT WHEN THE BLUE ONE IS IT STILL TURNS SPLIT
Line_2787	THIS COME DARKER IT'S IN A PLACE FOUL
Line_2788	SOME LIGHT THE RED BLUE LIGHT WILL NOT WILL NO DON'T CHANGE THE COURSE BUT THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE IT BRIGHT
Line_2789	IT'S THE SAME COLLE AS AR AR WEN THE ONE AS FOR RED BLUE A GREEN LIGHT IT MAKES IT BRIGHTER
Line_2790	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN UHM GAS
Line_2791	MEAN IN BLUE LIGHTS IT JUST TIS THE SAME BUT FOR THE RED LIKE IT
Line_2792	N LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNICS AND LIGHTS AND METERS
Line_2793	IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_2794	THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT THEY MAKE A A COMPLETE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2795	BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METERS LIGHTS ELECTRO MAGNETS AND FILTERING LIGHT
Line_2796	THEY EACH OTHER SEPARATE PAFULLY
Line_2797	IS A ER NO PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_2798	PARALLEL CIRCUIT CARS EACH NO PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE EACH OF THE LIGHT BULBS HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY SAME HERE
Line_2799	UM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN I TH
Line_2800	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2801	UM I THINK THIS CIRCUIT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2802	IT IS A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH OF THEIR ON PATHWAYS
Line_2803	THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY EACH OTHER ON A PATHWAY THEY HAVE TO W THEY DON'T SHARE IT
Line_2804	IT'S A S PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2805	THE THINK WOULD STILL THEY WOULD STILL BE BRIGHTER
Line_2806	THE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE TOP ARE MUCH MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE BUL
Line_2807	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT WELL IN THE RIGHT LASTS LONGER THAN THE THE ONE
Line_2808	THE SERIES CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER AND THEN THE SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE GROWN A PATHWAY
Line_2809	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METER S LIGHTS FILTERING LIGHTS AND ELECTROMAGNET
Line_2810	A STRING OF IT IS A BUNCH OF LIGHT AND A SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2811	THE THE THE ONE BURNS OUT TOO
Line_2812	BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THAT ON THE ONE STOPS BURNING
Line_2813	UM WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT BUT THE ONE DOES NOT BURN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SHOWING THE SAME PATH WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_2814	UM WHEN ONE DIES OUT THE THE ONE DOES NOT AND WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT AGAIN IT TURNS BACK ON
Line_2815	WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE THE THE ONE DOES BECAUSE THE SAME SHARE THE SAME ALL
Line_2816	UM A PARALLEL CIRCUIT NO SERIES SEE
Line_2817	IT BUT IT IT STOPS FLOWING IT STOPS IT STOPS GLOW BUT IN
Line_2818	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANY MORE ONE ONES BURNED OUT BECAUSE THERE IS A WHOLE IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_2819	UHM THEY ARE ALL BRIGHT
Line_2820	LIGHT IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_2821	I THINK IT CAN COME TO OR THE LIGHT BULBS AND OVER HEAD LIGHT
Line_2822	I CAN SEE A A LIGHT BULB
Line_2823	THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH A PRISM AND BEING BROKEN APART INTO THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2824	UH BRAKES UP THE LIGHT INTO ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2825	IT IS RED DING OPEN APART INTO ALL THE COLORS OF AN
Line_2826	TELL YOU THAT I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE LIGHTS UM BOUNCES OFF THE BLUE BULB AS BLUE LIGHT
Line_2827	MORTAL M OH THE UM BLUE BULB IS FILTURNING THE BLUE LIGHT OUT OF THE WHIGHT LIGHT
Line_2828	IT'S BOUNCING OFF THE BALL ITS BULB
Line_2829	THE LIGHT IS GETTING FILTERED INTO YELLOW LI
Line_2830	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB IS A YELLOW LIGHT BECAUSE THE BULB IS REFLECTING R YELLOW LIGHT OUT THE LIGHT
Line_2831	LIGHT RASEDITHER HITTING BULB OR WEIGHT THE LIGHT RAYS REFLECTING OFF ARE YELLOW
Line_2832	T THEY ARE YEAH L
Line_2833	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CMPTORS I MEAN ENERGY AND CIRCUITS
Line_2834	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2835	THERE'S SHOWING PATTERNS WHICH
Line_2836	OH A HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2837	WE'VE BEEN DOING ENERGY AND CIRCUIT S
Line_2838	THEY'RE FORMING THE CONSTOLATION A RIRON
Line_2839	THEY ARE CALLED ICONSTOLATIONS
Line_2840	IT'S A WRIAN
Line_2841	IT RISES FROM THE EAST AND ITS IN THE WEST
Line_2842	WELL THE EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN AND SO IT IT'S TURNING AROUND COST
Line_2843	THE EARTH GOING ABOUT THE SUNS
Line_2844	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND CIRCUIT
Line_2845	M I AM NOT RELATION
Line_2846	THE LIGHT IS GOING TO THE BOY'S EYES
Line_2847	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_2848	LIGHT LET'S YOU SEE THINGS UH IT REFLECTS OFF THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE THEM
Line_2849	I KNOW THAT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF ANYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
Line_2850	THEY'RE REFLECTING OFF OF THE M
Line_2851	THEY HAVE TO BE A SOLID FOR LIGHT TO REFLECT OFF OF THEM
Line_2852	I NOTICED THAT THEY REFLECT OFF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_2853	LIGHT REFLECTS OFF DIFFERENT WAYS WHEN IT HITS A SOLID OBJECT
Line_2854	THE LIGHT IS SHINING ON TO THE BOY AND THEN ON TO THE METER SO THAT HE CAN SEE HIMSELF IN THE MER
Line_2855	BECAUSE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND SHOWING OVER TO HIM
Line_2856	IT'S BEING USED TO REFLECT LIKE A SPOT LIGHT ON A BUILDING
Line_2857	THE LIGHT REFLECTS BACK OVER TO THE FIRST NER
Line_2858	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE MARS AND IT'S HITTING THEM SO THAT THEY REFLECT ON TO THE ONE OTHER M
Line_2859	THEN THE LIGHT HITS THE LAST STOP
Line_2860	G PENCILS AND THE WATER AND IT'S REFLECTING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BROKEN
Line_2861	T LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING BROKEN
Line_2862	TE WATER THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE WATER TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE PENCIL ON THE LEFT IS BROKEN
Line_2863	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE REFLECTION OF LIGHTS HITTING WATER AND HITTING DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_2864	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT AND S REFLECTION
Line_2865	THEY ARE ALL MAKING FLIGHT WITH ENERGY
Line_2866	YOU CAN SEE THE- THEY'RE CHANGING COLORS
Line_2867	A A CANDLE A LIGHT BULB AND THE SUN
Line_2868	A PRISM BREAKS UP THE WEIGHT LIGHT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW WEIGHT LITERS CANTAINWHIGHT LIGHT CONTAINS ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AND L
Line_2869	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OVER THE BLUE BALL E TURNING BLUE
Line_2870	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_2871	THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THE YELLOW BULB AND TURNING YELLOW AND GOING TO THE SIDE
Line_2872	THERE ARE ONE IS WHICH LIGHT AND ONE IS YELLOW
Line_2873	ONE BULB IS BLUE AND ONE BULB IS YELLOW I
Line_2874	UM IT HAS LIGHT AND YOU'RE BREAKING UP THE LIGHT INTO RAT
Line_2875	THE TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2876	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE THING'S UH WOULD CHANGE
Line_2877	IT TURNS THE LIGHTS BLUE
Line_2878	YELLOW AND BLUE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS SO WHEN THEY MIXED TOGETHER THERE THEY KIND OF MAKE OTHER COLOR
Line_2879	SOME THINGS TURN THE SAME COLOR BUT SOME THINGS BURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2880	THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER GREEN BUT THE RED AND THE BLUE WILL MAKES IT LOOK THE SAME
Line_2881	WELL THE LIGHT CHANGED DIFFERENT COLORED THINGS DIFFERENT
Line_2882	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN IT'LL LOOK GREENER
Line_2883	THEY TURN BROWNISH AND THE GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT AND TURNS MORE REDDISH I AND THE RED LIGHT
Line_2884	RED AND GREEN ARE AND BLUE AND GREEN ARE ANY DIFFERENT BUT RIGHT IS RATHER
Line_2885	UM BAD EH
Line_2886	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHTS AND CIRCUITS AND LIGHT AND THE COLORS OF THE RAMBO AND REFLECTION
Line_2887	AT NIGHT THERE ISN'T AS MUCH LIGHT AND THEN THE DAY THERE IS
Line_2888	THE SUN GOES UP ON THE WEST AND COMES UP ON THE EAST AND COMES DOWN ON THE WEST AND THERE'S CONSTOLATIONS IN THE SKY
Line_2889	THE CON SOLUTIONS GO AWAAY
Line_2890	NIGHT THERE'S STARS
Line_2891	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT THE NIGHT SKY AND LIGHT AND ENERGY AND ALL CIRCUITS AND STUFF
Line_2892	UM IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOON AND THE HOW IT DOGS
Line_2893	IS THE ROTATION OF THE MOON
Line_2894	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE MAN GOES ABOUT THE SUNS
Line_2895	UM I DONE WITH THE FIRST SECOND
Line_2896	RAINING CRESCENT
Line_2897	IT'S ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE MILE
Line_2898	EITHER MOSTLY FULL OR YEAH THE MOSTLY FULL
Line_2899	I NOTICED THAT THERE LIKE THREE QUART YEAH THREE QUARTERS OF THE WEIGHT FUEL
Line_2900	CRESCANTS ARE UM MOST THEY H NOT FULL
Line_2901	COLLAR
Line_2902	THEY ALL PRODUCE LIKE
Line_2903	IT IS WIT LIGHT
Line_2904	THE SUN LIGHT BULB OR A CANDLE STICK
Line_2905	ITS SPLIT UP TO MANY COLORS
Line_2906	DOES THE RAINBOW
Line_2907	IT'S THE RIGHT B
Line_2908	THEY'RE PRITY U
Line_2909	OOH NO UP TO WORK
Line_2910	WHEN THE LIGHT LIGHT HITS THE BLUE BULB IT TURNS INTO A BLUE LIGHT
Line_2911	THE AA IN THE BULB IS STILL WHIGHT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE BLUE
Line_2912	SAME THING JUST THE IT'S JUST YELLOW THIS TIMES
Line_2913	A'S REFLECTING
Line_2914	THE ONE THAT HITS IT IS HITTING A WHIT SPOT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE HITTING THE YELLOW SPOT
Line_2915	WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PAPER IT CHANGES THE COLOR OF THE OBJECTS
Line_2916	SHADES OF A LIGHT
Line_2917	THEY CHANGED COLOR
Line_2918	YE STIR RAY
Line_2919	I DON'T KNOW W IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2920	OF COURSE A YEAH
Line_2921	OCABLARIES PUT THE BATTERY ON TOP OF LIGHT BULB
Line_2922	A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_2923	THE PATHWAY MEATY GOES TO THE WATER
Line_2924	LIGHT BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT TURN ON THE WIRES AND THE ELECT THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO POWER ONE LIGHT BUL
Line_2925	WHEN THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON IT'S BECAUSE THE ENERGY CIRCUIT POWERS IT D CELL TO THE LIGHT
Line_2926	I SEE ELECTRICITY HEATING THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH A C
Line_2927	IT'S ROLLING TO THE MINE SHINE IT IT'S GOING THROUGH THE PLUS LIGHT AND IT KEEPS ROUTE CHANGING AGAIN
Line_2928	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A CIRCUIT THAT CONNECTS
Line_2929	ELECTRICITY FULL TOWARD THE POSITIVE
Line_2930	ELECTRICITY AND H IT'S BLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_2931	THE POSITIVE SIGN THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLILLEDS TO THE POSITIVE SIGN
Line_2932	THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE OPPOSITE
Line_2933	THE FLOW IS GONE TO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2934	YOU FLIP IT IT CHANGES DIRECTIONS
Line_2935	I THINK IT HAD M I THINK IT M
Line_2936	UH UH GOOD
Line_2937	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2938	THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT ARE THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2939	S SOLUTIONS
Line_2940	ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS THE CHILD MAKES SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
Line_2941	THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THEN MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
Line_2942	THE SALT UH WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAN BE LE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE
Line_2944	WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2945	THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MADE A SOLUTION
Line_2946	I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2947	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND TAKING SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKES A MIXTURE
Line_2949	THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED IN
Line_2950	WHERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
Line_2951	THIS SALT IS A SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATERS IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_2952	THE SALT
Line_2953	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATES A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT
Line_2954	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHTS
Line_2955	THE MASS IS INCREASING
Line_2956	ONE KIND OF GRAM PLUS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS THI GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_2957	SOLUTIONS
Line_2958	THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2959	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU COULD PICK IT OUT BY HAND
Line_2960	YOU COULD LET IT EVAPORATE S
Line_2961	THANKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TOO I CAN WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
Line_2962	UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2963	SOLUTIONS ARE O TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2964	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2965	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLORS HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
Line_2966	I CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT S PURPLE STU
Line_2967	IT IS MORE DILUTIED
Line_2968	IT WOULD TASTE LESS FLAVOR FALL AND GRAPEY
Line_2969	I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTIONS BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
Line_2970	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
Line_2971	BY MARTY IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO LATER
Line_2972	I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FINAL IF TURN IT ON CREEPY
Line_2973	WE'VE BEEN WORKING BY MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THE ESPECIALLY UPON YOU CAN'T SE
Line_2974	ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER FOOD
Line_2975	YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS DIFFERENT
Line_2976	THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SHELL TOGETHER THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_2977	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2978	I THINK THE ONE WITH A GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS
Line_2979	I FOUND OUT THAT NO THAT MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WEIGHS A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
Line_2980	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2981	I AM SOLCALES I DON'T KNOW
Line_2982	ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2983	I I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2984	BYE MARNEY IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE-BYE
Line_2985	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND THAT SALT AND WATER MIX THE SALT DOES NOT DISSOLVES
Line_2986	IT RELATES BY A MIX SAYING WATER WITH SOLIDS
Line_2987	WE CALL IT A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIXES TOGETHER
Line_2988	HE WOULD CALL THESE SOLUTIONS
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF CEREAL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FILTERS OUT THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENT S
Line_2990	THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS ARE GETTING SEPARATED OUT OF THE MAIN PILES
Line_2991	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE IENT MASS OF SOLID
Line_2992	THE SCREEN IS FILTCURING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_2993	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY A SEPARATED
Line_2994	THE SALT AND WATER
Line_2995	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2996	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND WITH THIS MIXTURES IT BECOMES A SOLUTION NOT JUST A MIXTURE
Line_2997	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
Line_2998	WE ARE LEARNING THAT ALL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED D
Line_2999	THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_3000	A A SOLVENT
Line_3001	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND IS BECOMING AN MIXTURE WITH THE WATER
Line_3002	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECAME A SOLUTION
Line_3003	ALL OF THE MATERIALS WEIGHT DIDN'T ADD OR SUBTRACT THEY ALL JUST GOT ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3004	IT SHOWS US THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS KEEP THEY SAME MASS WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3005	YOU LETS THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3006	A A SOLUTION
Line_3007	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3008	IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE B
Line_3009	YOU CAN FILTER IT OUT IN A A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_3010	THE SALT WATER DID NOT FILTER OUT
Line_3011	A SOLUTIONS
Line_3012	YOU LETS THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3013	IT'S E EVAPORATING
Line_3014	IT'S LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE SO T THE MATERIAL IS STILL THERE
Line_3015	YOU COULD LET THE WATER EVAPORATE
Line_3016	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACES
Line_3017	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3018	BECAUSE IT SEPARATES THE TWO AND ARE
Line_3019	MAGNETS AND SCREENS
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE SEES SEPARATES THE LARGE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN UM FIT THROUGH THE SMALLER HOLES
Line_3021	AS THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THE MAGNET DRAWNS ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT
Line_3022	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3023	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL WOULD STAY ON TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WOULD FALL THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3024	EVERY MATERIAL OTHER THAN THE SALT STAYS ON THE FILTER BUT THE SALT FLOWS THROUGH
Line_3025	TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENTS OUT OTHERS THAN THE SALT
Line_3026	SALT WATER YOU EVAPORATED THE WATER SO THE SALT CRYSTALS CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND THEY TAKE UP A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3027	THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3028	HI MARNEY YOU LOOK VERY PREITTY TODAY NOT
Line_3029	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3030	YOU DISSOLVE A SOLUTE IN TO A SOLVENT
Line_3031	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3032	LIKE IN THE GREAT PLASTIC EXAMPLE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE PURPLE THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3033	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3034	TASTED COLOR AND S
Line_3035	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS A LESS CONCENTRATION AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE CONCENTRATION
Line_3036	THAT THEY LOSE MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3037	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS CONCENTRATE
Line_3038	LESS FLAVOR SALT
Line_3039	ONE TAKES MORE WATERY AND ONE AS MORE FULL OF FLAVOR
Line_3040	ADDING DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
Line_3041	ADDING OR TAKING AWAY WATER
Line_3042	BYE MARNEY I I'LL MISS YOU
Line_3043	GOOD HOW ARE YOU S BARNEY
Line_3044	THE DRINKS ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE DRINK ON THE RIGHT ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3045	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX YOU CAN TELL ME
Line_3046	E YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH A BALAN
Line_3047	THE A CONCENTRATION
Line_3048	ONE OF THE CUPS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER CUP
Line_3049	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3050	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE BECAUSE IT IS HEAVIER
Line_3051	MY PRIODICTION WAS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WAS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3052	THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND AS IT GOES TO THE RIGHT THEY GET MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3053	THE MOST CONCENTRATED IS ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS TWO
Line_3054	THE MOST IS ONE A THIS IS TWO
Line_3055	B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SEE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3056	BY MARNEY I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH
Line_3057	WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE MIXTURY INGREDIENT AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS BY FILTERING AND SCREENIING AND ALL THE SCIENTIFIC STUFF
Line_3058	ITS FLOW
Line_3059	IT SINKS
Line_3060	THAT SOLUTION A'S SATURATED THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3061	ONE HAS MORE DENSITY AND ONE HAS LESS DENSITY
Line_3062	ITS WOULD THINK
Line_3063	IF A A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT'S LESS DENSE
Line_3064	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION GOES TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE
Line_3065	THEY ARE CREATING A DIFFERENT SOLUTION WITH EQUAL CONCENTRATION
Line_3066	ONE RISES TO THE TOP AND ONE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3067	ONES MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER SO ONE FLOWS ON THE TOP THE OTHERS
Line_3068	THEY POUR SOLUTION A FIRST AND SOLUTION B SECOND
Line_3069	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION A IS MORE
Line_3070	BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION PIES ANOTHER SOLUTION EQUALS A BIGGER SOLUTION
Line_3071	THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE LEAST DENSED
Line_3072	THERE IS SEPARATING
Line_3073	BYE MARNEY I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I'M EXCITED FOR YOUR NEXT NEXT LESSON
Line_3074	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3075	THE SOLUTION CREATED SALT WHEN IT DISSOLVED
Line_3076	THE CHEMICALS IN THE MATERIALS CREATING THE SOLUTION MADE A SALT
Line_3077	THE INGREDIENTS MADE A NEW PRODUCTS
Line_3078	THE MIXTURE CREATES GAS
Line_3079	THEY CHANGED TO FORM GAS AND SALT
Line_3080	THERE IS DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_3081	THE TWO MIXED TOGETHER AND MARS HAPPENED
Line_3082	THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
Line_3083	IT TELLS ME THAT EVERY THING ON EARTH CAN BE RE MADE OR DESTROYED
Line_3084	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE LET THE GASES GO WHEN ONE KEPT THE GAS SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3085	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND ONE BAG IS CLOSE
Line_3086	WE WEREN'T LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_3087	YOU ARE SEPARATING THEM INTO DIFFERENT PILES SO WHEN THEY
Line_3088	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A MIXT
Line_3089	THEY ARE IN GROUPS HAND OF WHAT THEY ARE
Line_3090	YOU ARE FILTERING IT OUT SO THAT IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANY
Line_3091	HEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_3092	IT IS IMPORING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT IS IT GOT SEPARATED AND IT IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_3093	THEY WON'T THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3094	IT I S FILL DRAWING OUT THE SAND
Line_3095	ITS SALT UHM
Line_3096	THE SALT GETS DISSOLVED TO MAKES THE WATER HIGHER
Line_3097	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND
Line_3098	YES YOU CAN GET IT OUT BY UM EVAPORATING THE WATER
Line_3099	IT CAN NOT GET A SEPARATED
Line_3100	MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS CAN NOT
Line_3101	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3102	THEY CAN BE THIN THE
Line_3103	WEIGHT MIXTURES BY A SCREEN MAGNETISM AND DENSITY
Line_3104	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN
Line_3105	TH A MIXTURE
Line_3106	TO SEPARATE OUT THE ROCKS
Line_3107	BECAUSE THAT THING IS MAGNETIC SO THAT TO STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_3108	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY BE MAGNETIC AND THEY MIGHT NOT T
Line_3109	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3110	BECAUSE PAPER BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3111	IT SEPARATED OUT THE ROCKS BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN FIT IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK MORE EFFICIENT LEA THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3113	ITS WORKS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3114	BECAUSE A SAND CAN'T GO THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT WORKS
Line_3115	IT WORKED BECAUSE ALL THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT WAS BACK THEN
Line_3116	IT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT HAS TO BE SEPARATED NO OTHER WAY WIDTH WORK
Line_3117	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE ALL TO GET EVERYTHING IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_3118	T'S TRYING TO HO PROVE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TOGETHER IT CHANGES ITS PROPERTY
Line_3119	YOU ARE MIXING A SAND AND WATER TOGETHER TO MAKE A SAND AND WATER SOLUTION
Line_3120	THE SALT THE SALT WILL
Line_3121	THE SALT GOT MIXED IN AND THEIR AND DISSOLVED IN THE SAND DID
Line_3122	IT DISSOLVE TO SHOW THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3123	IT IS THE THING THAT IS THAT IS NOT GETTING L
Line_3124	BECAUSE THEY THEY STAND TOGETHER OR AND IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED
Line_3125	THE SALT IS A SOLUTE AND IT GETS DISSOLVE
Line_3126	IT IS SOLVENT AND THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO IT
Line_3127	A SOLLUTE
Line_3128	T IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND HEAVIER THEN EACH SEPARATE
Line_3129	WHEN YOU ADD IT TOGETHER IT AS THE GRAMS OF THE SALT
Line_3130	IT IS ADDING MORE WEIGHT
Line_3131	T MEAN THAT WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT HAS MORE WEIGHT
Line_3132	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVY
Line_3133	THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER ITS FIFTY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3134	IT'S FIFTY PLUS FIFTY PLUS FIFTY FIFTEEN AND IT SHOWS THAT THE SALT KEEPS IT'S UN PROPER KEEPS IT'S ON WEIGH
Line_3135	SOLUTIONS
Line_3136	WE CAN EITHER SEPARATE BY EVAPORATING IT LIKE SALT AND WATER OR USE SOMETHING TO FREAK
Line_3137	YOU'RE SEPARATING OUT THE FLOWERS BY PUTTING IT IN THE FILTER AND YOU'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_3138	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3139	A MIXTURE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SAND WAS SEPARATED AND IF IT HAD STAYED IN THE WATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLUTION
Line_3140	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3141	THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED AND INTO THE WATER AND IT COULDN'T BE SO WE SEPARATED WITH THIS FILTER
Line_3142	SOLUTIONS
Line_3143	THE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE SALT OUT
Line_3144	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND THEN YOU EVAPORATED IT SO THEN IT IT UH IT WAS BACK TO THE THE SALT AGAIN
Line_3145	IT IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AGAIN
Line_3146	IT IS EVAPORATING
Line_3147	IT WORKS THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION BUT I YEAH
Line_3148	ONLY A SALT TO SHOW THAT IT WORKED TO SEPARATE IT OUT
Line_3149	THEY ARE PERFECT SQUARES THE SO THE SALT DIDN'T CONTAIN ITS SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3150	IT REQUIRES TIME YOU NEED TIME TO EVAPORATE STUFF
Line_3151	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A A SOLUTE FROM A SOLUTION AND YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT AND WATER BY EVAPORATION
Line_3152	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3153	A SOLUTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED HOW YOU MAKE IT IS YOU MIX SOMETHING TOGETHER
Line_3154	HUH THE SOLUTE
Line_3155	YOU CAN SEE BY HOW MUCH HOW THE DIFFERENT THE COLOR
Line_3156	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE SOLUTES AND IT IS DARKER
Line_3157	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3158	THE MORE COLORS IT HAS OR HOW MUCH OR HOW MUCH MORE POWDER IT HAS
Line_3159	HE MORE POWDER IT HAD
Line_3160	THE DARKER OR LIGHTER THE COLOR IS
Line_3161	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3162	IT IS LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3163	IT WOULD TASTE MORE FLAVOR FULL
Line_3164	IT WOULD TASTE UH LESS CONCENTRATED LESS FLAVERFUL
Line_3165	IT IS NOT AS SWEET AND FLAVERUL
Line_3166	YOU CAN UH DO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER SO HAVE LESS IN IT
Line_3167	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER SO IF BE MORE SPREAD OUT
Line_3168	HAD MORE WATER
Line_3169	BYE I
Line_3170	WE ARE WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3171	ONE'S A MIXTURE ONES SOLUT
Line_3172	THE FEATHER WAS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WAS NINETY GRAM
Line_3173	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE
Line_3174	WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF IN SCIENCE
Line_3175	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TWENTY
Line_3176	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHERS HAS TEN GRAMS OF
Line_3177	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS WILL WEIGH M OR
Line_3178	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE WEIGHED MOR
Line_3179	BECAUSE ONE HAS A TWENTY GRAMS THE OTHER HAS TEN
Line_3180	THE GREAT ONE GETS DARKER AND DARKER WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED AND MORE CONSUMER
Line_3181	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_3182	THE MOST IS ONE THE LEAST IS THREE
Line_3183	ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LESS CONCENTR
Line_3184	WHERE WE ARE
Line_3185	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3186	YOU ADD A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT IT IS THE
Line_3187	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3188	YOU ADD THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CA YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THEM IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3189	THE FIRST ONE HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND THEREFORE IT IS MORE DENSED
Line_3190	THE ONES ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER SO IT IS MORE
Line_3191	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THEREFORE IT IS MORE
Line_3192	HOW DARK OR LIGHT IT IS OR HOW DENSE OR HOW CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3193	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND IS THEREFORE LESS OR MORE S
Line_3194	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE DENSE AND THE LIGHTER ONES ARE LESS DENSE
Line_3195	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS POWDER IN IT
Line_3196	THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE SONG FILLS OF THE DRINK MIX AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS AND IS LESS COLORFUL
Line_3197	MORE IT WOULD HAVE MORE FLAVOR
Line_3198	IT WOULDN'T CASE LESS FLAVERFUL
Line_3199	IF YOU ADD MORE SOLVENTS
Line_3200	THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES EXCEPT FOR THE WATER AND THE TOP RIGHT I GUESS
Line_3201	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTIONS
Line_3202	THE MIXTURE OF THE TRAIL MIXES SEPARATING INTO SEPARATE PILES CHOCKLITS NUTS AND RAISINS S
Line_3203	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_3204	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TO DIFFERENT PILES
Line_3205	THE WATER IS SPLITTING FROM THE MARBLES BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN AND MARBLES CAN'T FIT THROUGH THOSE TINY SPACERS
Line_3206	TE MARBLES SEPARATE FROM THE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN
Line_3207	IT TOOK OUT IT UHM
Line_3208	THE WATER IS NOW A CLEAR
Line_3209	IT EVAPORATES
Line_3210	NOW
Line_3211	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3212	MIXTURES KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOLUTIONS MIXED TOGET
Line_3213	I I HAT YOU
Line_3214	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3215	MIXTURES ARE LIKE SOLODES
Line_3216	A FOSS SIGHESCEPAL
Line_3217	NOT SO GOOD
Line_3218	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3219	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT THE SAND AND THE WATER S DIDN'T
Line_3220	THE WATER IS MIXING WITH THE GREAT TASTIC AREA MIXED AND IT'S MIXING
Line_3221	AH A SOLID I'D MOST
Line_3222	I DON'T KNOW I'M GONNA TO TALK TO YOU
Line_3223	SOLUTE IS THE SALT
Line_3224	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3225	THE SALT IT'S CALLED A
Line_3226	IT IS ALL THE WEIGHT OF THREE OTHER CIDUMS TOGETHER
Line_3227	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3228	A A SOLUTE
Line_3229	TOLD YOU BEFORE IT'S A SOLVENT A
Line_3230	BECAUSE THEY ARE MANY BECAUSE THEY ALL
Line_3231	GOOD BYE MARNEY
Line_3232	WE'VE BEEN DOING UH MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3233	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALAD THE PAPER CLIPS THIS WOOD AND THE BEN
Line_3234	THE SALAD HAS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS ON THE
Line_3235	THEY ARE MIXED UNLIKE THE OTHERS PILES
Line_3236	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE SAND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3237	THE RAISONS THE EMINIMS AND THE NUTS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3238	THEY USED TO BE MIXED ALTOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3239	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND COLORS
Line_3240	YOU SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3241	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE SEPARATE NOW
Line_3242	WIRE WE WERE FLOATING HEAD ON A PETISTAL
Line_3243	THE WATER UM IS NOT SEPARATED FROM THE SAND SO THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE THINGS
Line_3244	THEY GOT A FILTER DIDN'T THEY
Line_3245	YOU USED A SPECIAL TYPE OF TOOLS TO FILTER THE SAND FROM THE WATER
Line_3246	THE SALT AND WATER DISSOLVES THE DER WATER DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS ARE IS JUST A MIXTURE
Line_3247	IT'S DISSOLVING A SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE SALT
Line_3248	MAY BE YOU JUST NEED TO I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU THE QUESTION
Line_3249	IT WAS FILTERED BY THAT BLUE FILTERING MACHINE
Line_3250	THE WATER WILL GET DISSOLUBED
Line_3251	NO BECAUSE IT UM MIXED IN WITH THE WATER SO YOU'D HAVE TO SO YOU CAN T
Line_3252	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY TELL ME WHY
Line_3253	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR FULL BODAY
Line_3254	TO SHOW ME YOUR WHOLE BODY PLEASE
Line_3255	WHY DO YOU KICK ME THE MARBLES MARNE Y
Line_3256	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND THE SAND MADE THE UM AND THE SAND MADE THE WATER VERY VERY DIRTY
Line_3257	CAN YOU REPEAT MY SENTENCE YOU PICKED ME IN THE BARE
Line_3258	THE SALT DISAPPEARS AND IT EVAPORATED WHILE THE SAND IT JUST SANK TO THE BOTTOM AND MADE THE WATER DIRTY
Line_3259	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT LIKE THE GRAPE STUFF UM IT LIKE A IT'S A THE WATER ABOUT HUNDRED U
Line_3260	THE SALT DISSOLVES UNLIKE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE SAND AND WATER IT LIKE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND MAKES THE WATER ALL DIRTY I HATE YOU FACE BARNEY
Line_3261	THEY'RE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY EQUAL FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3262	THE SALT ADDED WEIGHT TO THE WATER SO NOW IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS RATHER THAN FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3263	THAT IF YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT YOU STILL HAS WEIGHT TO IT DON'T YOU
Line_3264	SOME OF THEM DISSOLVED LIKE THE SALT AND SOME OF THEM DON'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SAND
Line_3265	THEY ALL GOT MIXED TOGETHER SO NOW IT'S THE WHOLE MIXTURE
Line_3266	ES IS GETTING LARGER BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING THREE DIFFERENT THING
Line_3267	THAT FIFTY GRAMS IS EQUAL TO ONE CUP OF UH WATER
Line_3268	I I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME THE ANSWER
Line_3269	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FILTER
Line_3270	THE FLOWER MIXES WITH THE WATER CAN BE FILTERED SO THE WATER AND THE FLOWER CAN BE SEPARATED AGAIN
Line_3271	THIS MEANS THAT IT'S STILL AND A MIXTURE SO THE SALT IS STILL IN THE WATER
Line_3272	THE CITRIC ACID COULD NOT BE FILTERED OUT
Line_3273	AFTER THE DAYS IT'S THE WASHER DISSOLVED AND NOW THEY HAVE THESE SALT QUES
Line_3274	THE WATER IS GONE AND THE SALT IS STILL THERE EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T SEE IT AND THE MIXTURE
Line_3275	YOU CAN FILTER OUT THE SALTS FROM THE WATER
Line_3276	THAT OVER TIME THE WATER EVAPORATES AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AND SQUARES NOT A CRYSTAL
Line_3277	THAT EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO THE SEPARATE SALT AND WATER
Line_3278	IS MY FRIEND FROM VERY IGNERENTS OR IS HE NOT HE'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT
Line_3279	MIXTURES IN SOLUTION-
Line_3280	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBBLES SAND WATER
Line_3281	I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS ONE BECAUSE UM YOU IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WEIGHT SO
Line_3282	UH AM BARNY ARE YOU FAT
Line_3283	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE SAND
Line_3284	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE I MY US
Line_3285	BRING A MAGNET TO GET ALL THE UM THE PAPER CLIPS OUT SO FROM THE SAND AND SIDE
Line_3286	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE SAND AND WATER
Line_3287	I'M TALKING TO A WOMAN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAT
Line_3288	THIS IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE RE
Line_3289	THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETS IN
Line_3290	IT'S NOT TO RIGHT ONE MORENE BECAUSE UM WAS ALL BE ON YOUR SIDE
Line_3291	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEELS FROM THE WATER
Line_3292	YOU USE THE UM COFFY FILTER TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE S
Line_3293	SALT WATER DISSOLVED DENOUNCED THE SALT PIECES
Line_3294	THE SALT WATER IS EVAPORATING SO THE SALT IS LACK
Line_3295	HAT YOU PUT THE SALT WATER IN THAT THICK ON A BOBBER AND NOW IT DISSOLVED WATER DISSOLVED SO YEAH
Line_3296	ABOUT HOW EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SOLUTION
Line_3297	ARE YOU THAT ARE EVEN NOT
Line_3298	I STEEL VERY TIRED
Line_3299	WE'VE BEEN BEEN TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE ON SCIENCE MORNING
Line_3300	U USING A FILTER
Line_3301	VERY TO THE ARI
Line_3302	ABOUT MIXTURES AND SITE SHONES
Line_3303	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTE
Line_3304	A GRAPE TASTIC THAT'S WHAT IT'S COOL
Line_3305	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3306	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3307	THE DARKER ONE HAS THE MORE MOST SOLUTION IN
Line_3308	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN VARALLY SEE THROUGH THE THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM VERY EASILY
Line_3309	YOU LIT A SOLM FOR MEN PLEASE
Line_3310	ONE HAS FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND FIVE SPOONFULS AND ONE HAS FIFTY MILLINGLITERS OF WATER AND ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3311	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE UM FLAVER HAS A LOT MORE FLAVER IN IT THAN THE ONE SPOON FULL
Line_3312	THE ONE WITH SIX SPOONFULS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE THAN THE ONE WITH THREE SPOONS
Line_3313	IT WOULD TASTE VERY WASHERS
Line_3314	IRE TO DYMOURNEY
Line_3315	I'M DOING GOOD MARNIE HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_3316	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING INTERESTING IN SCIENCE E
Line_3317	THE GREAT MIX IS PURPLE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS CLEAR THE SALT IS TRAMTRANSPARENT
Line_3318	UH YOU CAN BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_3319	THE FEATHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAMS THE ROCK ITS GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3320	OTHER WEIGHS LESS THAN THE ROCKS
Line_3321	MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT MARNEY THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTES
Line_3322	ONE HAS OR GRAMS ONE HAS GRAMS SO ONE GRAMS WILL BE HEVIER
Line_3323	THE SALT WATER LOOKS THE SAME AND THE GREAT MIX ARE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_3324	THEY ARE ALL UHM NOT EVEN
Line_3325	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3326	I HATE YOU MARNEY SO MUCH YOU'RE TIN CREEPY BUT YOU HELP ME WITH SCIENCE SOM THANKS
Line_3327	I FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING THE OTHER BULB I'S STICKING
Line_3328	LEARNING ABOUT NUCILARAM MISCLES
Line_3329	IT IT'S ARE AND IT WOULD E
Line_3330	IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT POWDER ON THE LEFT IS MIXED IN WITH HOT WATER
Line_3331	YOU MIX SOMETHING WITH WASHER THAT MAKES A SOLUTE
Line_3332	YOU MAKE THE SALT WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATE-
Line_3333	THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT SO IT'S SETTLING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_3334	THE EROSION SALT OR EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_3335	EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM
Line_3336	TE SALT EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM SO THE WATER CAN HOLD ANY MORE
Line_3337	THE WATER IS SATURATED CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE WATER OF SALT
Line_3338	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF W
Line_3339	THE SALT SOLUTION IS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS WHICH SO IT MEANS THE SALT IS SEVENTEEN GRAMS AND THEN
Line_3340	SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS OF UM SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS IS LEVEL WITH THE SOLUTE
Line_3341	GOOD I FILL A GREAT MORE BUT I NOT
Line_3342	MY OBNOXIOUS FRIENDS ANE AND EPRUM KEEPS TALKING SO I CAN'T TELL YOU I'M SORRY MARNEY
Line_3343	YOU PUT SHOGERS CITRIC ACID AND EM EPSOM SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3344	YOU ARE MIXING THE CECTRIC ACID AND MEMROSAM SALT TOGETHER
Line_3345	THE WATER IS SO SATURATED THAT ONE OF NO MORE EPSOM SALT OR CITRIC ACID CAN GO IN
Line_3346	THE SHOGAR IS WEIGHTS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE EPSOM SALT AND THE CITRIC ACID
Line_3347	I GOT THE MOVES LIKE JAM I GOT A BUS LIKE A
Line_3348	I DON'T KNOW BUT CLEAN ONE'S ON DON'T GET A CON
Line_3349	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS MARNEY BUT IT IT SAYS SOLUBILITY THE
Line_3350	SO LE SATURATED WIND IT I NO MORE SALT LEFT OVER SO IN YOU HAVE TO FILL IT ALL A
Line_3351	I THINK IT'S SUBSTANCE SORRY
Line_3352	IT'S CROSSING THE OFF THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION A WASHER
Line_3353	THE PEPRONIUM SALT IS LIKE
Line_3354	OOD SOMETHING
Line_3355	I THINK EPROSOM SALT IS ON THE DISC
Line_3356	WHEN YOU PUT VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA TOGETHER THEY'RE THEY MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH MAKES IT ALL BUBBLY
Line_3357	THE PRODUCE
Line_3358	THE CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3359	THE CONTRACT OR SOMETHING
Line_3360	YOU MIXED ALL U THEM TOGETHER
Line_3361	THEY'RE JUST MISSING THE WATER
Line_3362	HAT'S WATER WITH THE BAKING SODA IS LIKE UM FING
Line_3363	THEY'RE BLUE WAIT AND SILVER
Line_3364	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT ATOMS
Line_3365	THE BAKING SODA ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE VINEGAR HAS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT
Line_3366	NO THEY LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
Line_3367	MEANS THEY MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3368	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3369	WELL A MIXTURE OF BAKING SODA AND HALCMAN CHLORIDE
Line_3370	PARTICIPANT TEN
Line_3371	WHEN YOU PUT SODIUM HUNK SIDE AND FIF- FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH HIDROLLICK ASIDE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_3372	WHAT ARE THE PURPLE ATOMS
Line_3373	TWO OF THEM ARE PURPLE THEY ALL USED TO BE BLUE
Line_3374	YOU CAN UM DISSOLVE IT YOU PUT IT OUT ON THE TRAY AND IT DISSOLVES SO YOU CAN FIND THE A
Line_3375	UM IT GOT WATERY ON THE OUTSIDE TOO
Line_3376	YOU HAD CALCIUM CHLORIDE AT THE BOTTOM WHAT HOW DO YOU GET THE
Line_3377	THE CARBONATED WATER IS SO CARBONATED THAT IT IT CAN STOP MOVING WITH THE CARBONATION
Line_3378	IT REACTED BUT IT LIKE FIZZED UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY FAST
Line_3379	THERE IS NO REACTION
Line_3380	IT WENT FROM RAINY TO SNOWY TO DIRTY AND THE COUNTER FELL OFF
Line_3381	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3382	THE BIKE RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE ER SO THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T HAVE BECOME REACTION
Line_3383	IT'S GLOWING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
Line_3384	ONCE YOU SNAP THE TICK THE STUFF INSIDE IT MAKES THE CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT CAN GLOW
Line_3385	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT TURNS PURPLE GOODBYE MONEY
Line_3386	NOT IT'S A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3387	YOU STUCK BARNEY I HATE YOU SO MUCH I
Line_3388	T TIRED REALLY REALLY TIRED
Line_3389	A REACTION DIDN'T A CAR NO THING FI HAPPENED
Line_3390	CALCIUM CORRIDE AND THE BAKING SODA HAD A REACTION AND IT MADE IT FI
Line_3391	OH AND THE SOLID IS A PRODUCT AND IT'S YELLOW
Line_3392	IT'S SIX S GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_3393	A REACTANT PLUS REACTANCE EQUALS THE PRODUCT SO TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE EQUALS SIXTY
Line_3394	THAT THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3395	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN IS FIFTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSE IS SIXTY ONE
Line_3396	BECAUSE THE ONE PUT THE BAG UP AND LET THE GASES OUT
Line_3397	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3398	WELL THERE ARE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER AND THIS F THESE THINGS
Line_3399	THE FIRST PILE IS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE AND THE SECOND PILE IS THREE PILES THAT ARE THE SAME TIPES
Line_3400	WELL UM IN THE LOUD PILE THERE ARE UM THE STUFF MIXED TOGETHER THE BEANS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3401	BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT APART INTO EACH INTO GROUPS THAT ARE THE SAME TIP
Line_3402	THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT INTO PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME
Line_3403	INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TO WITH THEIR OWN FIND
Line_3404	THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER WHEN THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3405	RE BEING SEPARATED AND AND THE UM MARBLES WERE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3406	WELL THE SAND IS A SOLID SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH PAPER SO SEES BEING SEPARATED
Line_3407	THEY SEPARATED SO NOW THE WATER IS IS UM UM PURIFIED WHEAT IS PURE WATER AND THE DIRT THERE ARE THE SAND IS JUST NOW SAND
Line_3408	THE SAND AND WATER ARE BEING SEPARATED AND TO EACH INTO GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN TO
Line_3409	THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER THE SENT THE SAND AND DR BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3410	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3411	OKAY UM I
Line_3412	THE WATER MAKES THE SALT DISSOLVE AND THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER TO CREATE THE MIX THE UM SOLUTIONS
Line_3413	THE THE IT'S BEING THE WATER'S BEING UH SEPARATED FROM THE DIRT
Line_3414	IT'S A TYPE OF A MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3415	WILL BECOME A PART OF THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3416	THE GRAPE DOES PROBABLY CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3417	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3418	THEY'RE MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT A MADE A SOLUTION
Line_3419	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND ALL SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND STAYS THERE
Line_3420	I THINK IT MIGHT BE PULLING IT MAY DISSOLVE INTO THE GREAT DOSE SO THE GREAT DOSE MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATE
Line_3421	WELL I THINK THE SALT'S GONNA DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS ONE
Line_3422	I THINK THE SOLVENT IS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA DISSOLVE INTO THE WATE
Line_3423	THAT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST ADDING TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS SO TH THE SOLUTION IS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3424	BARELY JUST ADDING THEM UP
Line_3425	THAT SOLUTE THAT SOLUTION CAN WEIGH MORE THAN THE UM SOLVENT AND THE SOL
Line_3426	THE MASS IS GETTING HEAVIER AND DENSER
Line_3427	ITS WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE INDIVIDUAL UM UH COMPONENTS
Line_3428	THAT IS THAT IT ADDS UP
Line_3429	BY FILING OUT THE PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE EACH ON
Line_3430	THAT IT MIXES WITH THE WATER AND IT STAYS AND THE WATER CAUSES ALSO A
Line_3431	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE LIQUID WITH A LIQUID IT'S REALLY IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UM SEPARA
Line_3432	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3433	IT'S EVAPORATING FROM THE THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_3434	I MAKES A LIQUID WITH UM WITH A SOLID THEN YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT TO TO SEPARATE IT
Line_3435	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATED
Line_3436	THAT THEY'RE MIXING THE SALT AND THE WATER AND THAT JUST THEN THE WATER IS EVAPORATING IN THE SALT IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS
Line_3437	EN SUNLIGHT AND LIGHT AND HEAT MOSTLY HEAT
Line_3438	HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR TO EVAPORATE SO
Line_3439	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3440	THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING TO MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
Line_3441	IF THERE IS IF THERE IS LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE UM GET A ROCK OUT OF MAGNET THEN YOU COULD USE A MAGNET TO GET MAGNETITE
Line_3442	HEY ARE SEPARATING THE ROCKS OR THE PEBBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3443	THAT THE ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FRESHENING UP THE WATER
Line_3444	THE ROCKS STAND STOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH TO THE OTHER CUP
Line_3445	THE THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE WA THE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT OR WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGH AND THE THE PEBBLES ARE STAINING ON TOP
Line_3446	THAT THE MAGNET THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE SAFETY OPENS
Line_3447	UH WELL FOR THIS ONE WE'RE USING MAGNETS TO SEPARATE
Line_3448	A SOL A SOLO AND A SOLUTE
Line_3449	I WE GET SOMETHING WITH MAGNETITE AND WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT
Line_3450	THAT THE ROCKS SE ON TOP OR THE PEBBLES STAYED ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH E
Line_3451	BECAUSE BECAUSE A PARTIAL SIZE TO GET THE ROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER THROUGH
Line_3452	THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE MOCK WITH THE LITTLE TINY PEBBLES CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT SO ON
Line_3453	CAUSE IT THE LITTLE PEBBLES CAN GO THROUGH IT
Line_3454	THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE IT THE THE N THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE BUT THE SALT WOULD STAY THERE
Line_3455	THAT THAT THE UM IT THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY
Line_3456	WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOOLS A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLUTES AND SOLVENTS
Line_3457	JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HEARD YOU SAY SOLUTIONS
Line_3458	MIXTURES ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER
Line_3459	BY USING WATER EVAPORATION MAYBE MAGNETISM
Line_3460	THREES THE PERSONS USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT
Line_3461	THEY'RE USING A SCREEN TO PORTION THE ROCKS FROM THE WATE
Line_3462	THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP OF IT SO YOU'RE SEPARATING THE WA ROCKS FROM THE WATER
Line_3463	ROCKS AND THE WATER GETS SEPARATE AND THE WATER GOES DOWN BUT THE ROCKS STAY ON TOP
Line_3464	BECAUSE THE ROCKS AND PARTICLES SIZED THEM SO THAT THE ROCKS
Line_3465	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE MAGNET THE MAGNET THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT TO USE A MAG
Line_3466	BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT TOOLS CAN HELP WITH DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3467	GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNETS
Line_3468	I NOTICE THAT THE ROCK STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM OR THE WA THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SEED
Line_3469	CAUSE THE ROCKS CAN GET THROUGH THE SEE BUT THE WATER AND THE MOON CAN
Line_3470	I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYS ON TOP AND THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH IT
Line_3471	THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH THE FEE FILTER BUT THE UM SAND CAN
Line_3472	MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALT WILL STAY THEY THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND MAKE LITTLE CRYSTAL
Line_3473	I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A MIXTURE
Line_3474	I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TOOLS HELP WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES BY E
Line_3475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIX UH SOLUTION
Line_3476	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3477	CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT
Line_3478	THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_3479	THE LEFT PILES IS SEPARATED
Line_3480	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3481	THEY GET SEPARATED
Line_3482	THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY WERE BEFORE
Line_3483	THE WATER LEAKED THROUGH THE THING AND THE MARBLE STAINED ON TOP
Line_3484	THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND THE MARBLES DIDN'T
Line_3485	THE MARBLES STAYED
Line_3486	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT DISAPPEARS ON WATER
Line_3487	THE SALT DISAPPEARS
Line_3488	IT DIAPERS THE A
Line_3489	WHAT'S
Line_3490	I I'M SO GOOD
Line_3491	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3492	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3493	S SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE WATER
Line_3494	BLEABLBBLEAD'S ARING I DON'T EVER KNOW W
Line_3495	THE PILES ON THE LEFT IS SEPARATED
Line_3496	THE RIGHT PILES IS SEPARATED
Line_3497	M MIXTURES
Line_3498	IT'S THE
Line_3499	THEY'RE SEPARATED ALL OF THEM
Line_3500	THE CANDY THE PENETS AND THE RAISINS ARE ALL IN SEPARATE PILES NOW
Line_3501	THERE IS SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_3502	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE STIFT AND THE MARBLES DID NOT
Line_3503	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVERNIENT WAY
Line_3504	THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER CAME OUT CLEAR
Line_3505	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3506	ONE EXAMPLE IS SHOOGER IN TO THE AND SALT INTO WATER AND WHEN SOMETHING DISSOLVES IT USUALLY COMES BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3507	IF YOU JUST PUT A IF YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT WON'T DISSOLVE
Line_3508	SOLUTIONS
Line_3509	THE SALT WILL GET THE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT IT
Line_3510	IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET BACK BUT IT'S DEFEINATLY POSSIBLE
Line_3511	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS
Line_3512	THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
Line_3513	M MIXTURE
Line_3514	THE SAND IS A SOLUTION AND THE SALT IS NOT
Line_3515	I BELIEVE THE ROLE THE WATER PLACING IS A SOLUTE
Line_3516	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3517	A A SOLUTE
Line_3518	THE SALT IS SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS A SOLVENT
Line_3519	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS S
Line_3520	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLA FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3521	WHEN YOU ADD THE MASSES TOGETHER THEY EQUAL THE END RESULT
Line_3522	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE UM MASS OF A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION YOU GET THE SENDING MA
Line_3523	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS S
Line_3524	NO MASS IS LOST OR GAINED IN THIS PROSESS
Line_3525	THE WEIGHT IS CONSERVED
Line_3526	COINSERVATION OF MASS
Line_3527	Y YOU CAN DO THAT IN A MIXTURE
Line_3528	THE SALT STAYED IN THE PAPER AND WHEN THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3529	IT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE WHEN WE STARTED
Line_3530	THE CITRIC ACID STAYED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER FILTERS THROUGH
Line_3531	IT'S ACTUALLY A SOLUTION
Line_3532	YOU MIGHT USE EVAPORATION
Line_3533	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT CRYSTALS BEHIND
Line_3534	THE EVAPORATION WHEN WELL WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES UP INTO THE SKIN
Line_3535	IT GOES UP INTO THE SKIN
Line_3536	TIMES PASSING
Line_3537	I'M A WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
Line_3538	EVAPORATION IS ONE WAY TO SEPARATE MIXTURE OF W
Line_3539	THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3540	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETTING EXTRACTED FROM THE DRY MIXTURE BY THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3541	MIX MIXTURES ARE MIXED
Line_3542	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3543	YOU PUT ONE LIQUID INTO ANOTHER SOLID AT
Line_3544	ONE WATER MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3545	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SOLUTIONS IN IT
Line_3546	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS A DARKER COLOR
Line_3547	THERE IS MORE POWDER IN THE GRIP GLASS ON THE LEFT RIGHT I MEAN I MEAN
Line_3548	THE MASS OF THE CONCENTRATED WATER
Line_3549	THE COLOR AND THE MASS
Line_3550	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE REST
Line_3551	BECAUSE THE LIGHTER COLOR HAS HAVE LESS CONCENTRATION IN THEM
Line_3552	MORE SHOGARIOY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3553	IT HAS LESS FLAVERLING IN IT
Line_3554	BE ADDING WATER
Line_3555	YOU TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SOLUTION
Line_3556	YOU TAKE AWAY SOME SOLUTIONS
Line_3557	BYE MARNIE I
Line_3558	M ONE I'M DOING OKAY
Line_3559	SO TODAY WE WORKED ON HOW CONCENTRATED THINGS MIGHT BE LIKE HOW CONCENTRATED FRUITPUNCH MIGHT BE
Line_3560	THE CORK IS MORE DENSE THAN THE PENNY
Line_3561	IT WILL FLOAT
Line_3562	IT THINKS
Line_3563	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOW CONCENTRATED WATER CAN GET WHEN YOU ADD CONCENTRATED POWDER
Line_3564	THE FEATHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_3565	BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT JUST IT STAYS TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS EVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED
Line_3566	THE LEAST GRAPE DRINK MIX IS THE MORE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3567	YOU WEIGH THEM
Line_3568	NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_3569	NUMBER BE A GUESS
Line_3570	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3571	WELL A MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3572	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY AND THAT'S WHY THE WATER IS CARRYING
Line_3573	AN OBJECT THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW INSTEAD OF SINK
Line_3574	IT'LL FLOAT
Line_3575	IT'LL SANK MARNIE
Line_3576	Y SOLUTION A WILL BE MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTE
Line_3577	IF A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT'S MORE LIKELY WHEN YOU DROP SOMETHING IN IT WILL FLOW
Line_3578	SOLUTION B IS MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION A BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SALT IN TO WATER THE SALT WON'T ALWAYS DISSOLVE
Line_3579	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3580	SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE SO IT WILL RISE TO THE TOP
Line_3581	THE LESS END WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE DENSE L SA TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3582	IT'LL LAYERS ON ON THE VERY TOP
Line_3583	ONES PUTS SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM AND SOLUTION B ON THE TOP
Line_3584	BECAUSE AS ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE IN CORRECT ORDER THEY'LL SINK I MEAN TO MIX
Line_3585	GOOD
Line_3586	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION AND A LIQUID
Line_3587	THE SHIOLGER IS THE MOST SATURATED AND UM THE KILMASON RIGHT NOW
Line_3588	TWELVE GRAM SAND MEANS SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3589	WHEN YOU EVAPORATE THE CITRIC ACID EPSOM SALT AND REGULAR SALT THE CRYSTALS MAY FORM A DIFFERENT PATTERN
Line_3590	GOD BYE OH OH IT'S DOING IT IT'S ONE FIFTY I GOT TO GO BYE
Line_3591	Y ARE SOLID
Line_3592	WATER AND MARBLES WATER IS A SALT IS A LIQUID AND MARBLES ARE A SALT
Line_3593	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3594	MARNEY THEY SEPARATE ONES MARNEY MAKES SERIES BUT IT'S MARNEY THEY SEPARATE
Line_3595	THEY SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT PIECES
Line_3596	THE MOUNT SAND APPLE A STRAINER AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3597	WELL THE MARBLES ARE ON TOP O THE STRAINER AND THE WATER RUNS THROUGH
Line_3598	THE SAND GOT OUT IN THE SEPARATORS AND THE WATER WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH T
Line_3599	DA SALT MIXES TOGETHER WHERE AS THE PAPER CLIPS AND WHICH CLIPS STONE UP
Line_3600	NO BECAUSE THE UM GRAPE TASTIC STUFF T
Line_3601	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTE
Line_3602	THEY ARE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TO MAKE A SOL
Line_3603	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVED
Line_3604	A SOLUTE DRY THE SALT WATER IS A SOLAR S
Line_3605	SHE'S BONE A SOLUTION
Line_3606	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE
Line_3607	IT IS WATER AND IT HELPS THE THE SALT TO
Line_3608	THESE SALT WATER IS MIXED TOGETHER CREATING THE MASS OF THE SALT AND WATER
Line_3609	WHEN THE SALT WHICH IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WHICH IS FIFTY GRAMS ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3610	WE S DIFFERENT UM MATERIALS BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPERTIES THEY THINGS HAVE
Line_3611	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THE WATER WENT COMPLETELY THROUGH
Line_3612	THE SOLUTE IS A MIXTURE
Line_3613	THERE WAS NO MIX THERE WAS NO MIXTURE AND THE SOLUTIONS
Line_3614	HE LOSES THE DIFFERENT PAPER TIES ARE AN ADVANTAGE
Line_3615	THE WATER AND THE SALT AND WATER SOLUTION DISSOLVED
Line_3616	IT HELPS SEPARATE THE DISSOLVED ITEMS FROM THE SOLUTE SO THE SOLVENT
Line_3617	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO GET THE RICE CRYSTALS BACK
Line_3618	THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT IT ISN'T AND BECAUSE YOU CAN UH
Line_3619	THE WATER EVAPORATES AND THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LESS
Line_3620	THE SUNLIGHT
Line_3621	YOU CAN NOT SEPARATE THE SOLID FROM THE SOLVENT AND SOLUTION UNLESS YOU EVAPORATE THE SALT
Line_3622	ONE HAS MORE CONCENTRATION THAN THE ONE
Line_3623	COULD YOU REPEAT THAT MARNEY
Line_3624	THE DARKER THE COLOR THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
Line_3625	THE DARKER HAS MORE POWDER AND THE LIGHTER HAS LESS POWDER OR
Line_3626	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3627	THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_3628	BIT HAS MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER
Line_3629	ONE HAS MORE GREY THE ONE THAT HAS MORE GREY POWER IS ACE MORE LIKE PEACE MORE LIKE GREY
Line_3630	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE LIKE WATER THAN THE GRAPE FLAVORING
Line_3631	IT TAKES A W UNLIKE WATER TO
Line_3632	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER BUT KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT AS GRAPE CASTICK STUFF
Line_3633	BY ADDING MORE OR LESS WATERS
Line_3634	WE ARE FINDING MISTER A MYSTERY SOL
Line_3635	IT IS SALT AND WATER MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3636	IT IS SATURATED FULLY SATURATE
Line_3637	THE MORE SALT YOU ADD THE MORE WATER LIKE THE HIGHER THE WATER GET
Line_3638	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER CAN NOT HOLD ANY MORE SALT
Line_3639	AFTER THREE SCOOPS SCOOPS OF EPSON SALT THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED AND NO MORE SALT CAN DISSOLVES
Line_3640	THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED WHICH MEANS NO MORE IT CAN HOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3641	THE SOLUTION IS NO LONGER SOLUBLE
Line_3642	THE SHOGAR IS MORE SOLUABLE THAN THE EPSOM SALT WHICH MEANS MORE SHOGAR CAN DISSOLVE IN THE W
Line_3643	ITS A NO LONGER SOLUTE BUL
Line_3644	THE SALT ADDS MORE MASS
Line_3645	IT TOOK FORCE SCOOPS FOR THE WATER TO COMPLETE BE COMPLETELY SOLID SO SATURATED WITH THE CITRIC ASIDE AND SIX SCOOPS TO BE
Line_3646	SHOOGER IS SIX SCOOPS MORE SOLUBLE I MEAN TWO SCOOPS MORE SOLUABLE THAN TRI
Line_3647	SHOGAR IS TWO MORE SCOOPS VALUABLE THEN THE CITRIC ACID
Line_3648	SOME DISSOLVE MORE AN LAM MORE IN WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE SOLUTE
Line_3649	THE WATER GRAMS MASS BECAUSE OF THE SALT THAT IS GOING INTO
Line_3650	CITRIC ACID IS THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM EPSON SALT IS THE ONE ON THE TOP LEFT AND SALT IS THE ONE ON THESE SO RIGHT
Line_3651	I THINK IT IS EPSOM S
Line_3652	I I THINK THEY ARE MADE OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3653	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AND THEN THE TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES MIX TOGETHER TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CALLES SALT
Line_3654	THE SOLUTE MADE THE REACTION REACTS
Line_3655	THE SOLUTION IN THE BAG CAUSE A REACTION THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS STEEL OR CARBON DIOCUSIDE AND THE BAG
Line_3656	AND THE BAKING SODA AND THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE THE BAKING SODA IS DENSER THAN THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3657	I SEE WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3658	THE MOLECULES TOOK AND REARRANGED THEMSELVES TO CREATE A NEW PRODUCT
Line_3659	O CAN WE
Line_3660	A REALLY BAD A REALLY BAD SALAD
Line_3661	SALID TRAIL MIX CHWOLIPPERS NO PAPER CLIPS WATER
Line_3662	SALADS AND WATER
Line_3663	Y MARNIE
Line_3664	I I DON'T CARE
Line_3665	WHO DO PLEASE JUST LAY ME ALONE U
Line_3666	STOP RE BEING EVERYTHING YOU SAY STUFF TICKS MARBLES NOT MARNIE
Line_3667	WHAT IS THIS EVEN IMPORTANT MARNEY PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME AND YOU HAVE A CHICK SLASH YOU LOOK SO WEAR
Line_3668	UH GRO MARNEY FARTED
Line_3669	THE THING'S GOING TO GLITCH RIGHT UM YOU ADDED WATER TO A CUP WIDE BORING DO
Line_3670	AY IT'S GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL DAY BECAUSE I'VE GOT IN THE SHOWER PERS
Line_3671	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNIE
Line_3672	WHEN YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER IT WILL DISSOLVES
Line_3673	NOT THE WHO
Line_3674	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3675	THE SALT IS THE SALT GOES
Line_3676	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE BECAUSE IT DISAPPEARS DISSOLVING MEANS DISAPPEARING
Line_3677	NATTEMPTING TO MAKE THE WATER DIFFERENT
Line_3678	REPEAT MARNEY I SERIOUSLY
Line_3679	THE SALT DISSOLVED MARNEY B BA BA BA N BA BA BA
Line_3680	MY IGNARENT FRIEND KATE OVER THERE IS JUST BEING AN IGNARENT
Line_3681	ET THINK CAT NEEDS TO TAKE A BATH
Line_3682	IT'S DARK AND HER I'VE STARTED
Line_3683	MARNEY I'M AWAKE AND HEALTHY
Line_3684	WHY SHOULD I YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A COMPUTER PROGRAM YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING CA
Line_3685	YOU ACTUALLY SPOKE IN TO ARE LITTLE BIT
Line_3686	THE SALT IS BEING ADDED TO THE WATER AND IT'S CALLED THE VAULT ROPE NOVES AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_3687	HUH YOU'RE CREEPY
Line_3688	AND THE GRAPE TO THE WATER MARNE UM NOT STUPID
Line_3689	YOU ADD THE SALT TO THE WATER AND IT MAKES A ROLE
Line_3690	CAT'S SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A PACK OF EGGS
Line_3691	MY ON TOES MY JOHN ONES MY TURN ON JUNE
Line_3692	UM IT'S BEING OUTED INTO TRAIL MIX
Line_3693	USE RIGHT UM WELL THE SCREEN IS BLACK MORNING
Line_3694	IT'S EVAPORATED AND TO SOLUTIONS
Line_3695	GRAMS ARE BEING ADDED YOU HAVE TO EVEN OUT THE THE GRAMS TO HAVE IT EQUAL
Line_3696	AY THE R MARNEY
Line_3697	GRAVEL A TOOTHPICKS AND MATH AND PAPER CLIPS YOU USE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE GRAVEL AND TOOTHPICK
Line_3698	THE PROPERTY IS OFF I DON'T CARE
Line_3699	UM IT'S KIND OF DARK MARNEY SO CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW ME AN ANIMATION
Line_3700	WED THAT
Line_3701	MAGNETISM I SAID THAT ALREADY GOES
Line_3702	EAT THE ROCKS FROM THE WATERS
Line_3703	BECAUSE YOU CAN USE WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATER AND THE JAR MARNEY
Line_3704	YOU TO USE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_3705	BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIPS ARE MADE OF METAL AND THE MAGNETS PICK UP MET
Line_3706	I I DON'T CARE
Line_3707	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_3708	BECAUSE THE FILTER ONLY LET'S WATER COME THROUGH IT AND NOT GRAVEL
Line_3709	DON'T T PLEASE LET ME LE WHAT DID YOU WHILE YOU SINK MALLIFUNXTION MALL
Line_3710	I J HUH PHONE WAS OUR CLOCK
Line_3711	A MIXTURE IS BEING MADE THERE IS A DARK AND A LIGHT THE LIGHT AS LIKE WATER AND THE DARK TASTE LIKE GREEN
Line_3712	A A SOLUTION

Line_3717	EXCUSE ME CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_3718	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU TODAY MARNEY
Line_3719	EVAPORATION AND MIXTURES
Line_3720	YES A FEATHER WEIGHS TWO OUNCES AND A ROCK WEIGHS THREE POUNDS S
Line_3721	AT AN EFFERIUM WEIGH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS
Line_3722	EIGHTY GRAMS IS HEAVIER THAN TWO GRAMS
Line_3723	THE TOTAL AS THE TWENTY GRAMS WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE TWENTY IS BIGGER THAN TEN WELL YOU
Line_3724	MY FRIEND KATE THINKS YOU'RE HA
Line_3725	IT'S KATE HOREBLE AT MINE CRAFT
Line_3726	THERE IS MORE GRAMS OF GREAT GREAP MIXTURE AND THE THIRD GLASS
Line_3727	A MORNING WHERE YOU READED MY CREAM BECAUSE I KNOW CAS NOT
Line_3728	GOOD ATE UHM CAN GET A GIRL FRIEND AS USUAL AND I THINK HE'S GETTING WEIGHT
Line_3729	GOOD KATE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A GIRL FRIEND OBVIOUSLY AND YOU'RE STILL WEAKER
Line_3730	WE WERE DOING WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT RAIMBOWS IN A TOB
Line_3731	SHELL ME AN ATTABACE
Line_3732	HE
Line_3733	I DON'T KNOW WELL YOU'RE HERE WELL ACTUALLY THE PENNY IS IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK WHICH MAKES THE CORK FLOW SO THE PENNY SINK
Line_3734	TH THE SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3735	ONE WOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3736	ARSTOCERS MORNING HOW ARE YOU DOING TO DAY BY HOW ARE YOU HAT STUFF YOU'RE PROGRAM
Line_3737	WE WISH YOU WILL MARRY CRISS
Line_3738	I SAY YOU SHOULD JUMP INTO THAT CUP AND DROWN YOURSELF YOU'RE UGLY
Line_3739	THEY FLOW TO THE TOP AND THE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION B SINKS TO THE BOTT
Line_3740	C THE LESS CON CONSTANT CONENTRATED
Line_3741	I'M A FIFTEEN YEAR A GIRL IN SIDE
Line_3742	T WILL FLICK TO THE TOP
Line_3743	THEY ALL MIX SO NOW IT'S ONE BIG SOLUTION A
Line_3744	M MORE DENSE SOLUTION
Line_3745	REPEAT THREE D
Line_3746	OKAY BYE WALKED OFF A
Line_3747	I THINK L HAS DILUTION FUELS ON SON
Line_3748	AYREPEANED
Line_3749	WOULD YOU REPEAT THAT MIRMALINEO MY IDIOTIC FR
Line_3750	THEY ARE LEARNING ON DISSOLVING OH I DON'T KNOW HERE'S SOME COMING FOR HIM
Line_3751	YOU'RE DISSOLVING IT
Line_3752	MARNEY SEE I'M SORRY THAT MY FRIEND YOU'RE COMPLAIN WHAT IS YOUR DICE
Line_3753	MILLILITERS IT IS BEING IT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT ALSO IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE THAT IS THE STILL SALT PARTICLES LESS
Line_3754	YOU'RE TRYING TO
Line_3755	YOU HAVE TO MIX A SALT SOLUTION WITH THE FIFTY MILLIMETERS OF WATER DANG MARNEY YOU INTERRUPTED MY S
Line_3756	ATE N KATE'S DOING CAN ACID ELZERIOUSLY ST GO YOU GOO
Line_3757	THE SHOOGER WEIGHS MORE THAN THE CITRIC ACID AND THE
Line_3758	I DON'T KNOW THE MASS OF THE WEIGHTS ITS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS
Line_3759	IT'S SALT
Line_3760	I CAN DO A EXCECTRIC ACID I SWARE TO GOD
Line_3761	THE CHEMICALS OF BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED AND IT CREATED A CHEMICAL THAT MADE A REACTION TO MAKE IT FIZZ
Line_3762	A REACTION CALLED A OR SOLUTION
Line_3763	AM SOLUTION I SAID THAT
Line_3764	MIXTURES OFF OF KIL- HELP ME OUT HERE
Line_3765	EAR IS INSIDE THE BAG AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR YOU HARDLY CAN SEE IT
Line_3766	THEY'RE JUST STUFF MIX TOGETHER BUT THEY KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3767	CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOT
Line_3768	WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3769	IT'S A MIXTURE AND THE IT
Line_3770	ACTUALLY WE'RE ACTUALLY WARING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND NOT
Line_3771	WE'LL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_3772	UM SO THE SAND IS GOING INTO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS GOING INTO THE TO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS DISSOLVING
Line_3773	UH THE SALT UM DISSOLVED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SALT IS A DISSOLVING MATERIAL
Line_3774	THE WATER IS PLAIN AND THE IT'S THE GREAT TASTIC THING IS PLAIN DISSOLVE
Line_3775	UM NAMED FOR THE WATL IS A SOLVENT
Line_3776	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3777	WE CALL THAT THE SOLVENT
Line_3778	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PLAS THE WATER WITH SALT IT EQUALS SALT WATER AND SALT WATER WOULD BE HEAVIER THEN WATER BECAUSE IT HAS TO SALT IN
Line_3779	IT TELLS ME THAT ALL THE THE WEIGHTS STAYS THE SAME IN THE PROPERTY S
Line_3780	THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD A MATERIAL TOGETHER YOU ARE THE PRODUCT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAME
Line_3781	IT'S NOT THE SAME UH THE OKAY YOU ARE SO
Line_3782	THE MASS UH INCREASES BY FIFTEEN
Line_3783	THAT IT IS A CORRECT DITION PROBLEM
Line_3784	I I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_3785	THIS MEANS THAT THE CAN I MEAN THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3786	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3787	IT'S ACTUALLY A A MIXTURE
Line_3788	YOU CAN ONLY GET IT OUT IN A MIXTURE OR YOU CAN DO IT A SOLUTION IF IF IT'S LIKE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT
Line_3789	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
Line_3790	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3791	IT'S EVAPORATING SO YOU CAN SEE THE SALT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3792	IT IS EVAPORATING I'VE TOLD YOU SEVERAL TIMES
Line_3793	YOU COULD EVAPORATE IT IN STUDY
Line_3794	BYE YOU HAVE NICE ST
Line_3795	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_3796	WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE BY USING MAGNETS
Line_3797	YOU COULD USE DENCUITY MAGNETISM
Line_3798	WELL THE MIXTURE IS WITH GRAVEL AND WATER BUT WHEN YOU POUR IT THROUGH A SCREEN ONLY THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE GRAVEL STAYS ON THE SCREE
Line_3799	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE PROPERTY SIZES OF WATER
Line_3800	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PARNICAL SIZES
Line_3801	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS A MAGNETISM
Line_3802	IT WAS PARTICLE SIZE DISOLVITATION AND MAGNETISM
Line_3803	PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3804	BECAUSE UH THERE'S SOLIDS
Line_3805	BE BECAUSE WATER WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE THERE'S MORE THAN ONE THING AND ONLY THE PAPER CLIPS WOULD STICK TO THAT SO THAT'S AN EXILENT WAY TO SEPARATE
Line_3806	BECAUSE ALL MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_3807	BECAUSE MAGNET HAS MAGNETISM AND THE PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_3808	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIGGER SIZES CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3809	BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES CAN GO THROUGH BUT THE BIG ROCK CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3810	WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE COULD USE IT WITH THE CAREEN I DON'T KNOW WAIT NO NO I DON
Line_3811	CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE ON TO THERE NEXT
Line_3812	THAT YOU'RE SEPARATING THE M
Line_3813	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3814	BRING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS E V A
Line_3815	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3816	YOU'RE USING GREAT SE UH AND THERE IS ONE MORE CONCENTRATED AND ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3817	YOU CAN TELL IT BY WEIGHING IN IT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED OR ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3818	M YOU CAN DETERMINE THE BY WHICH IS MORE MORE CONCENTRATED AND WHICH IS MORE DILUTE
Line_3819	ONE HAS MORE POWER PER AND ONE HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3820	THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGHTER COLORS AND THE ELECTRIC ARORS ARE MORE DILUTE
Line_3821	WELL WITH LESS GREAT POWER WERE TASTE OR BE BORING AND THE ONE WITH MORE WILL TASTE MORE GRAPIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE GRIPASTIC
Line_3822	IT WOULD TASTE MORE WATERY
Line_3823	IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE IS MORE STRONGER AND IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAT MAKES IT STRONG AND THE ONE THAT'S MORE DILUTE IS NOT STRONG
Line_3824	I'M GOOD
Line_3825	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3826	WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTING DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT S
Line_3827	WELL ONE CAN BE SATURATED
Line_3828	ONE GETS SATURATED FASTER
Line_3829	THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I JUST SAID
Line_3830	UM KIND OF ALREADY EXCLAMED THAT
Line_3831	THEY'RE TRYING TO SATURATE
Line_3832	BY SEEING HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SATURATE
Line_3833	E SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN
Line_3834	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN UM I THINK IT'S SALT THOUGH
Line_3835	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN EIGHTY
Line_3836	WELL YOU CAN A MEANSOPORATED TH
Line_3837	ES PUMP SALT
Line_3838	WE'VE BEEN DOING CITRIC ASIDE AND CALCIUM CORD AND BAKING SO THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3839	THAT'S CALLED A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3840	TWO SIDE A SOLID
Line_3841	THAT THOSE TWO THINGS MAKES SALT
Line_3842	WE MIXED TWO SOLUTES TOGETHER AND THEN PUT THEM IN A SOLVENT AND THEN MADE CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3843	THOSE TWO CHEMICALS MAKE WHATEVER THAT WELL THEY MIX TOGETHER AND THEN UH
Line_3844	IT'S CHEMICAL REACT SHORDEN
Line_3845	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_3846	THAT ONE IS GREATER ONES LESS AND WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER AND OR ON TWO MORE POINT TWO
Line_3847	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN LET OUT GASES AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED CONCEELED THE GAS
Line_3848	EARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3849	THERE IS A SALAD MARBLES TRAIL MIX PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD C
Line_3850	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED TOGETHER WITH ALL THREE THINGS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATE
Line_3851	THEY GET SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COULD
Line_3852	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM A MIXTURE
Line_3853	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE WAT
Line_3854	THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3855	WE MADE A SOLUTION BY USING A FILTER AND THE FILTERS SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3856	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER MIX
Line_3857	THE SALT SEPARATE I NEVER MIND
Line_3858	THAT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT MIX MIXES IN TO THE WATER AND THEY BECOME ONE JUST SALT
Line_3859	THE SALT DISAPPEARS THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE TO FORM TO FORM THE LOTION
Line_3860	BECAUSE THE SALT AND THE GRAPE TASTIC MIXED WITH EACH OTHER MID A LI
Line_3861	WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT IT MARNI
Line_3862	IT'S A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING COMING TO E
Line_3863	THAT'S MIXTURE UM THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3864	THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE UM THAT'S
Line_3865	THE GRAB SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE M
Line_3866	THE COFFEE FILTER HELD THE SAND BUT LET GO UP THE WA
Line_3867	THE FILTER STOP THE SAND W
Line_3868	THE WOMAN AT MARNEY PLEASE LOVE YOU BABY
Line_3869	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE REST ARE MIX
Line_3870	THE SALT DISAPPEARED IN THE WATER AND IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3871	IT HAS A SOLUTION OKAY BUT THE HAD OH WE DON
Line_3872	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY WELL WHAT ADAM DID IS HE JUST KEPT SAYING IT WILL DO TH WHOLE THING
Line_3873	THE DIFFERENCE FROM A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION IT
Line_3874	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SO THE
Line_3875	THE WATER PLUS THE SAND EQUALS SAND WATER AND THEN THE WATER PLUS THE SALT EQUALS SALT W
Line_3876	WHAT'S A MIXTURE AND WHAT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3877	THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS JUST IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEN THE SALT AND WATER IS A A SOLUTE
Line_3878	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER WHICH IS A SOL
Line_3879	THE GREAT TA STICK IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER SO THE WATER WATER IS DIS SOLVENT
Line_3880	THE SALT IS E SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS DISSOLVENT
Line_3881	THAT GRAM FLOWS GRAMS EQUALS GRA
Line_3882	CANDY PLUS REASONS PU PEANUTS EQUALS A MIXTURE OF FIFTY GRA
Line_3883	THREE CUBES PLUS WATER EQUALS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MASS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME HEAVINESS
Line_3884	GRAMS GRAMS IT LETS GRAMS
Line_3885	THAT WATER PUT FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PUTS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT
Line_3886	USING A COFFEE FILTER
Line_3887	THAT MEANS IT'S A MIXTURE MARNIE
Line_3888	IT MIX OR SOLUTE
Line_3889	YOU'RE MIXING SALT AND WATER TO GET A A SOLUTION
Line_3890	THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT DIED THE SAME AND MADE IT
Line_3891	USE A PEACHERY DISH TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THE SALT TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THE WATER TO STOP B
Line_3892	THE SALT IS LEFT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE S
Line_3893	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT JUST STAYED ON THE PEACHER DISH BECAUSE IT'S A SOLID AND NOT A
Line_3894	WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES OR SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SEPARAT
Line_3895	THE- BYE
Line_3896	MIXTURE IS M SOLUTIONS
Line_3897	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING WHEN YOU TAKE TO THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUT IT TOGETHER
Line_3898	YOU'RE FILTERING THE ROCK OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3899	SO THAT YOU COULD GET A THE SOLID OUT FROM THE LIQUID
Line_3900	A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTE
Line_3901	YOU TO GET THE PEBBLES OUT OF THE S AND WATER
Line_3902	BECAUSE THE A MAGNET ATTRACTS OTHER METAL THINGS TO ATTACH TO T
Line_3903	TO SEPARATE SOLIDS FROM THE W
Line_3904	YOU FILTER IT TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST STUCK TO THE WATER TO GET OUT WITH THE FILL
Line_3905	WE USE THE FILTER TO SEPARATE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SMALL FROM THE WATER TO THE C
Line_3906	THE LAST ONE IS THE BEST TO MAKE DRY
Line_3907	BYE BUT BYE BYE SEE YOU BY
Line_3908	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3909	YOU CAN GET SALT AND WATER AND THEN MIX THE AND IT'LL ALMOST LOOK LIKE THE SALT DISAPPEARED BUT IT DIDN'T
Line_3910	IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3911	ONE HAS MORE A SOLUTE THAN THE
Line_3912	THERE IS MORE BOTH IN ONE THAN THE
Line_3913	A GRADURATED SULINDER
Line_3914	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3915	YOU CAN TELL BY WEIGHING IT FROM IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE
Line_3916	THAT ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE ONE
Line_3917	THAT ONE HAS A
Line_3918	THIS CAN PEAR A ALFULLY HUGE
Line_3919	I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH A BUM
Line_3920	THE ROCK HAS MORE MASS AND THE FEATHER SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3921	ONE IS MORE DILUTED THAN THE OTHER
Line_3922	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTION THAN THE ONE
Line_3923	IT WOULD BALANCED OUT THE SAME
Line_3924	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE
Line_3925	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ONE EACH ONE IS DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN EACH OTHERS
Line_3926	THREE AND TWO ARE THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THE M
Line_3927	NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3928	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBERS THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3929	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER THREE IS THE MOST DILUATED
Line_3930	THAT MEANS IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE HEAVIER SOLUTION
Line_3931	THEY BOTH HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF SALT
Line_3932	BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS HEAVIER THAN SOLUTION
Line_3933	YOU CAN TELL BY HOW DENSE EACH ONE IS TWELVE IS TWELVE D
Line_3934	THE DENSER ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BLUE CAN HOLD UP THE GREENS AND THE
Line_3935	YOU HAVE MIXED IN A MORE GRAPE SO GRAPE IT WHILE WATER
Line_3936	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS FIVE OF THEM FIVE OF W
Line_3937	WE WAITED
Line_3938	YOU WEED IT AND THE ONE WITH THE WE OR MORE IS CONCTRATED I THINK
Line_3939	UHM HOW MUCH THE SPOONS HOW MUCH THE SPOONFULS YOU HAVE
Line_3940	TH TASTE GOOD
Line_3941	I DON'T KNOW OH OKAY
Line_3942	THE LEAF HAS LESS
Line_3943	BETTER THAN THE BRIGHT
Line_3944	OH MEAL THOSE WO CAUSE THAT TIS LIKE WATER OKAY
Line_3945	IT WON'T TASTE THAT GOOD
Line_3946	YOU CAN STICK THE WATER OUT
Line_3947	TREES PLEASE CAN JUST MOVE ON
Line_3948	THE MOONS SUN AND PLANETS Y
Line_3949	HALF OF THE EARTH IS IN THE DAY OR THE LIGHT AND HALF THE EARTH IS IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS DARK
Line_3950	IT'S SIMILAR TO THE EARTH ROTATING AROUND THE SUN
Line_3951	THE SUN- ROTATING
Line_3952	THE AXIS THAT THE EARTH IS ROTATING ON
Line_3953	IT'S MORNING IN THE WEST AND NIGHT IN THE WEST
Line_3954	THE SUN AND THE EARTH AND A NORTH AMERICA
Line_3955	THE EARTH IS SPINNING AROUND THE SUNS
Line_3956	THE ANIMATION SHOWS ME THAT THE EARTH IS ACTUALLY MOVING AROUND THE SUN INSTEAD OF THE SUN MOVING AROUND THE EARTH
Line_3957	IT'S THE SAME ANIMATION BUT IT'S MOVED ON A DIFFERENT SPOT
Line_3958	A YEAR GOES BY WHEN THE WHEN THE EARTH MOVES ALL WAY AROUND THE SUN TO THE SAME SPOT IT WAS IN
Line_3959	IT COVERS A SYSTEM AS MEELS A CHAIR AND ENGINES AND OTHER STUFF
Line_3960	THE AND IS CONNECTED TO THE WEAL SO THE WEALS HOLD MOVE THE CAR AND JUST CONNECTED TO THE R
Line_3961	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKE IT MOVE LIKE THE WHEELS THE AXIAL AND EXHAUST AND THE ENDRIEN
Line_3962	THE WE ALS THE IN NOTHING AND THE END AND MIXED WEALS MOVE TO THE CARBON MOVE AND DRIVE
Line_3963	HUMAN IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS A WHOLE SUBITIRMS LIKE THE ONS YEAR THE INTESTINANTS CAN
Line_3964	IT SHOWS SOME LESS UBSISTING IT SHOWS SOME LESS U SISTOMS AND THE BIG SISTOM
Line_3965	ALL THE BLOUD VAIN
Line_3966	THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS A BIG SISTM WITH A WHOLE NEDRAS SUB SISTUMS
Line_3967	E A TRAIN
Line_3968	EARTH IS A BIG SUBSISTOM AND IT HAS A WHOLE TANTRMOVING PARTS
Line_3969	WELL THE EARTH IS A BIG SO C WITH HER THINGS LIKE THE BILE SFERE AND THE ATMEUSSFEERE AND OTHER FER
Line_3970	YES THE TH HAS HOPACITIOMS LIKE THE BUL SFERE THE ATMISSFERE AS CARS COMPUTORS S
Line_3971	W WERE SUB SISTOMS ON TOP THE BIG SIST ON ERTH
Line_3972	THESE SUBISTOMS ARE PART OF THE ERTH
Line_3973	FORE OF THEM ONE OF THEMS CALLED THE ATMSFERE AND THE OTHER WAS C IS NOTHER ONE CALLED THE BOTTOM SFERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE CALLED YEAH YEA
Line_3974	UH THE WATER AND THE FISH AND THERE ARE THE CURL AND ALL THE ALGANISMSOLIVE DOWN AND TO SEE
Line_3975	BUSPERS MILLA MADE UP OF WATER
Line_3976	AND IN THE FOREST AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3977	THE DESERT HAS DIFFERENT ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND THEY WE ARIEAS HAVE FIX COAL AND OTHER ORGANISM
Line_3978	I IT GETS MADE UP OF ANIMALS STAINS AND OTHER WATERS STUFF
Line_3979	THE EGOASISTOM IS THE BIG THING AND THE PILE SPIRIT IS SUBST
Line_3980	IT'S SAME FOOD TRAIN OF ALL THE FOOD YEAH
Line_3981	IT'S A FOODS LIKE YE
Line_3982	THAT'S THEY ALL MIXED UP TOGETHER SOME HOW
Line_3983	IRE ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE FOR THEY GO ALL AROUND THE CYCLE UNTIL THEY COME BACK TO POINT N
Line_3984	IT TREES ALL THE ANIMALS BEAT DO ALL A WAIT TIL THEY GET BACK TO THE END SO THEY CAN START
Line_3985	ACTING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN AND THAT'S A L HOW THEY EACH OTHER AND LET EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER THOUGH IT'S BACK
Line_3986	THAT THEY WOULD ALL MATCH UP AND BE ABLE TO EAT EACH E
Line_3987	THEY ARE LIVING ORGANISMS
Line_3988	DOING I'M DONE KAY
Line_3989	WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3990	WE WERE SEEING IF UH LIKED FLOWER OR SHOOGER MORE
Line_3991	I THINK THIS SHOWS LIKE UHM HOW ERELIEACES GAS AS IT EAT
Line_3992	IT'S SHOWING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT ONE USE EATS ONE USE TO EAT
Line_3993	THAT EAST SINGLE SETTLE AND DOESN'T HAVE A MOUTH OR ANYTHING
Line_3994	WE WERE GROWING WHEAT TO SEE HOW IT HOW IT ITS AFFECTED BY HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAS
Line_3995	ONE WAS NOT PUT INTO LIGHT SO IT DIDN'T GET THE SAME E DRAMS AS THE HELTHY ONE
Line_3996	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PLANS WHAT IT NEEDS TO GROW AND HOW IT GROWS
Line_3997	THE MIXTURE SHOW IT NEEDS SOIL LIGHT AND WATER
Line_3998	I THINK THIS PLANT DOES BECAUSE MOST PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3999	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED OCXIGIEN OR SOME FORM OF AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_4000	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME WEIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4001	ENGLISH SHOWS THAT THE PLANTS NEED SOME NORMAL FOOD OR MAYBE SOME FORM A NEW TRANS
Line_4002	THAT THEIR IN AWAY IS LIQUID SO IT CAN MOVE THROUGH OUT THE CELLS
Line_4003	IT SHOWS A HOMES BUT PLANTS DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A HOME
Line_4004	THEY COLLECT SH END THEY TRANSFER THAT AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHOGER WHICH THEY PASS THROUGH THE CELLS THIS IS CALL PLAS THE CENTS
Line_4005	THIS MAYBE SHOWS THAT THEY PLANT ID AND GET ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO MAKE ITS FOOD SO IT DIDN'T SERVE
Line_4006	ELL THERE IS A THING IT LEAVES CALLED CLOROFILL I OBSERVE THE SUNLIGHT AND REFLECTS IT GREEN MEANING THIS DON'T GET ANY SUNLIGHT SO YOU CAN REFLECT OFF RAIN
Line_4007	I DON'T THINK THIS PLANT HAS GOT AN ANY OCSIGIN
Line_4008	IT DIDN'T LET IT SAY BREATH MEANING IT COULDN'T GET ANY AIR INTO IT'S LEAVES OR LET IT FLOW THROUGH OUT
Line_4009	THIS PLANT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS EXCEPT WATER WHICH HELPS
Line_4010	THE PLANT HASN'T BE GETTING ANY WATER MEANING NOT OF IT'S FOOD CAN YET THROUGH OUT IT'S BODY
Line_4011	THE PLANT HAS EVERYTHING IT ADDS IT HAS THE WATER TO HELP EVERYTHING MOVE OUT THE SUN SO IT CAN GET IT'S ENERGY AND THE OCIGIEN SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT
Line_4012	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT CAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY CAN LEAD UP TO OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT NEED TO EAT THESE PRODUCERS IT ALSO SHOWS THAT T
Line_4013	TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS AND THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY ALSO NEED MANY TYPES OF THINGS LIKE WATER OCCIGIN AND LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_4014	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT COSTUMS
Line_4015	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CELLS AND WE DID AT LEAST EXPERIMENT A FEW TIMES AGO
Line_4016	IT SHOWS DIFFERENT CELLS AND HOW THEY'RE GROUP D
Line_4017	PLANT CELLS ARE LIGHTER DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HUMAN CELLS
Line_4018	THIS ONLY SHOWS ONE SECTION AS DOES IT WITH HUMANS
Line_4019	THAT THERE IS SHOWING A TYPE OF WELL IN A PART OF THE LEG
Line_4020	THEY ARE VERY LONG ENOUGH TO BE GROUP D TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE A MUSCLE
Line_4021	I THINK HE SHOWS MIRRORS AND THE BRAIN
Line_4022	IT'S SHOWING ME A BRAIN CELLS
Line_4023	I THINK THIS SHOWS ANOTHER PART OF AN UM SOME SELVES
Line_4024	THESE CELLS ARE IMPORTANT IS WE MAKE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BODY
Line_4025	WE'RE MADE OF MANY CELLS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS SEVEN
Line_4026	THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS CELLS AND THERE'S A LOT
Line_4027	I THINK MAYBE THE HUMAN HAS MORE CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MAKES UP A LARGER THING
Line_4028	IT SHOWS ABOUT A FLAGBAGE MAYBE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AS WE A
Line_4029	IT SHOWS A BUTTERFLY'S DI JUST SISTOM AS WELL AS THE HUMAN
Line_4030	THEY BOTH HAVE STUMICKS IN A WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEIR WAIST
Line_4031	SHOWING US PERHAPS WHERE THE DIGESTIVE SMART
Line_4032	IT CHOSE AND BRAKES DOWN FOODS BEFORE IT HAD DUN TO THE ALGAE
Line_4033	IT PUSHES DOWN FOOD INTO THE STU MICK WITH SOME STRONG MUSCLES
Line_4034	I KNOW THAT THIS IS VITAL SO THE HOOD OF FOOD CAN GET INTO THE STUMMICK AND SO IT CAN SO THE FOOD CAN BE BRAKED DOWN EVEN
Line_4035	THE SMALL INTESTINE REMOVES NEW TRAPS WHILE THE LARGE AN TEST REMOVES A MOISTURE
Line_4036	THEY ARE THE LONGEST PARELL THAT I JUST OF IT
Line_4037	ERLLIYTER WE WE'D TALK ABOUT THE MASCULAR SISTOM AND PLANT
Line_4038	IT'S PARA IT HAS PARALLEL VEINS
Line_4039	MAKE BELIEVE IT COULD BE A MAKE BELIEVE
Line_4040	PALM IT HAS PALM VAINS
Line_4041	LEAF HAS PENNY VINES
Line_4042	I THINK THE VAINSER FOR CARRYING IT TRENDS AROUND
Line_4043	I THINK THIS SHOWS A PLAN SEEN TO MAKE FILLED
Line_4044	I THINK THE NEW TRANS AND WATER AND FOOD TRAVEL THROUGH THE NAME ON LEAVE
Line_4045	I THINK THIS IS SHOWING WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAVES
Line_4046	IT TRANSPORTS FLUID AND OCIGION LIKE THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IN HUMAN'S
Line_4047	IT CHOSE WATER BEING RELICED FROM LEAVE
Line_4048	COVERING A LOT OF DIFFERENT VENT THINGS IN SCIENCE
Line_4049	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4050	I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_4051	CAN SEE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
Line_4052	THIS SHOWS HOW AIR GETS INTO THE LUNGS S HOW IT GETS OUT OF THE LUNGS
Line_4053	BREATHING HELPS US GET ON IN AND CARBON DI SIDE OUT
Line_4054	IT COMES IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND NOSE AND IT'S FILHERNED
Line_4055	INHALING IS BRINGING IN EXHALING IS ENDING OUT
Line_4056	THINKS THE MAIN ORGAN IS PELONGED
Line_4057	WHEN IT MOVES IT EITHER CAUSES LOW PRESSURE HIGH PRESSURE TO GET AIR IN OR OUT
Line_4058	OCIGIN GETTING INTO ER BLOOD IN CARPENDIAUXSIDE GETTING OUT
Line_4059	SO WE DON'T HAVE RANDOM GASES IN OUR BLOOD
Line_4060	AIR IS DRAGGED IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE AND IT IS BROUGHT DOWN BY THE TRACHEA
Line_4061	THE DIRFRAM DOES ALL THE WORK BY CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING
Line_4062	NOTHING MUCH
Line_4063	BE BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON LIVING CYSTOMS
Line_4064	BECAUSE OF HOW ALL THE SYSTEM THE CAR HAS WITH OTHER THINGS
Line_4065	BECAUSE HUMAN BODIES OR ISTOMS TWO
Line_4066	BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IT HAS
Line_4067	BECAUSE OF HOW IT HAS LIKE THE ARMS THE HEADS THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PART
Line_4068	REP REPEAT THE QUESTION
Line_4069	BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND THE LAND
Line_4070	RETREAT THE QUESTION PLEASED
Line_4071	IT SHOWS THE WEIGHER S IN THE LITTLE HILL AND SHOWS LIKE THE STUFF UNDER WATER AND BUILDING S
Line_4072	THERE ARE SOURCE
Line_4073	BY FILE IS ALL ABOUT LIKE FILL ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND BIRDS THAT ARE ON LIVING ON EARTH
Line_4074	I DON'T GET THAT QUESTION
Line_4075	IT'S JUST LIKE THE FOOD CHAIN
Line_4076	BECAUSE WHEN LIKE A BEAR INTO FISH A FISH IT DOES A SMALLER FISH
Line_4077	SAY THAT QUESTIONS AGAIN I DIDN'T HEAR YOU VERY GOOD
Line_4078	THE TWO PARTS THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE
Line_4079	HOUCK AND SNAKES
Line_4080	SAY THE EXACT QUESTION YOU JUST SAID YOU ARE SPEAKING REAL
Line_4081	IT'S ALL A SYSTEM
Line_4082	BECAUSE ALL THE PICTURES THAT YOU'RE A SHOWING OR A SYSTOM
Line_4083	BECAUSE IT CAR IS A SYSTEM
Line_4084	BECAUSE THESE CISTOMS ARE A SUB SYSTOM OF THE SYSTOM
Line_4085	BECAUSE THE SISTOM HAD SLOPE SISTOMS
Line_4086	BECAUSE IT'S A SISTOM WITH A UNJEDHENT YOU'RE DIFFERENT SUB CISTOM
Line_4087	BECAUSE IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT HAS LOTS OF OTHER UH LESS OF OTHER SUB CYSTOMS
Line_4088	DIGESTIVE SISTIM
Line_4089	REPEAT THE STICK DOESN'T QUESTION
Line_4090	THEY BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AN
Line_4091	THAT THE HEART IS ONE JIENTCYSTOM
Line_4092	WELL THE CIRCULATORY CIYSTOM THAT IS A SAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4093	HOSE ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE BODY
Line_4094	THE B PART ARE SO LESS
Line_4095	BECAUSE IT IS ONE CIRCUTRY SYSTEM
Line_4096	BLOOD BLOOD HEART AND YOUR BLOOD SILVES
Line_4097	IT PUMPS BLEED SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4098	THEY ARE IN THE BLUE IT THOSE ARE BLOOD THAT GOES IN YOUR HEART AND THEN IT COMES OUT
Line_4099	UM LEARNING ABOUT ISTOMS
Line_4100	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4101	IT HAS A LOT OF UNDIRECTING PARTS
Line_4102	AS A SUBSISTO-M AND A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4103	THEY ARE SUBSISTOMS
Line_4104	UH ALL OF IT'S INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4105	BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND THERE ARE FEW SUBISTOMS IN THEM
Line_4106	IT IS A SUBSISTOM AND THE UNIVERSE AND IT CAN BE A SISSTM OF IT'S OWN I GUESS
Line_4107	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4108	THERE ARE THREE THERE IS THE ATMUSFEER HIDROAW FEER AND THE I FORGOT THE LAST
Line_4109	THEY ARE PARTS
Line_4110	I THINK THIS IS A FOOD WEB A FOOD WEB
Line_4111	WELL THE EVERY THING GOES TO THE BACK TEREA AND THE FUNGUS WHEN IT DIES
Line_4112	ISTOMS
Line_4113	THEY ARE ALL PART OF A FOOD WEIB
Line_4114	IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD FROM THE SUN
Line_4115	THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER ORGANISMS THEY MAKE SHOGER FROM THE SUN WATER AND OCSIGON
Line_4116	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_4117	FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_4118	THE RABBIT THE LISERD THE BEAGLE THE BLUE JAY THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE
Line_4119	TE COMPOSTING OTHER ORGANISMS AS OTHER DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4120	BACTERIA AND FUNGI ARE DECOMPOSERS
Line_4121	A A PRODUCER IS MISSING
Line_4122	ONE I
Line_4123	THE MISSING ORGANISM IS FU TH
Line_4124	A PRODUCER IS MISSING THERE
Line_4125	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_4126	U I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4127	TO EAT MEAT AND TO EAT PLANTS S
Line_4128	CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_4129	OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_4130	A BEAR IS OMNIVOR
Line_4131	TO EAT ONLY DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4132	THEY ONLY EAT DEAD ORGANISMS AND A YEAH
Line_4133	ID COMPOSERS
Line_4134	IT MOST IS THE PURBLBOR
Line_4135	THE FOX IS UM THE FOX IS ON THE DOOR
Line_4136	THIS IS A K COMPOSER
Line_4137	AY RED WARM IS A D COMPOSER YEAH
Line_4138	CIBACICLY CLEAN UP
Line_4139	WE'RE DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4140	IT'S WATER AND IT GROWS
Line_4141	THE EAST IS ORGANISM AND THE EAST IS KIND OF A D COMPOSER AND IT BREAKS DOWN THE COKE
Line_4142	THE US NEEDS THE WATER TO BREAKS DOWN THE COOKIE FOR OBSORBTION
Line_4143	THEY ARE D COMPOSERS AND THEY'RE USED ON BREAD
Line_4144	WE WERE GROWING MEAT
Line_4145	HAS SOME LIGHT THE OTHERS DOESN'T HAVE SOME LIGHT
Line_4146	THE ROUTS OF THE PLANT AND WATERING THE PLANT
Line_4147	WATER SUNLIGHT AND SOIL
Line_4148	DOES NEED WATER BUT IT NEEDS IT ALSO NEEDS ORIGIN IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT AND IT NEADS NUTRANTS
Line_4149	THIS IS AIR PLANTS DO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_4150	SOME LIGHT AND NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_4151	NE TRANS PLANTS DO NEED NE TRANS TO SURVIVES
Line_4152	LITER PLANTS DON'T NEED FIRTALLIZER BUT IT HELPS THE PLANTS
Line_4153	HOUSE IT'S ABOUT IT W
Line_4154	UH YEA
Line_4155	UN IT SHOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE OF THE MATERIALS WOULD GET RID OF
Line_4156	BUT
Line_4157	THERE IS NO AIR SO IT WOULD DIE E
Line_4158	KILL ED IT ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4159	NO WATER IT'S NOT AS BAD AS NO AIR BUT STILL ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4160	THEY BOTH KRILL THE PLANS
Line_4161	THAT'S ALL THREE NEW DREAMS WITCH MAKES IT OSOME AND YEAH
Line_4162	BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE NEW GRAMS
Line_4163	THERE ARE THE STAR THE FOODWIB IF THERE WASN'T PRODUCERS THEN THE FOOD WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4164	FOOD WEBS AND SISTORMS AND LEAVES
Line_4165	IT'S E IT'S EST
Line_4166	THAT YEAST IS ALIVE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS A SETTLE OR SEAL IS ALIVE
Line_4167	IT'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS S
Line_4168	I SEE CELLS LEAF AND IT LOOKS SCHOOL
Line_4169	I SEEN A MUSCLE SELLS
Line_4170	THAT THEY'RE MUSCLE AND THEY'RE SELLS
Line_4171	IT SHOWS ME THE BRAIN TELLS
Line_4172	I I SEE REGULAR CELLS
Line_4173	SKIN CELLS CAN DROP DRIED AND DIES
Line_4174	SCAND ONE BLUDE ORGANS
Line_4175	ANDS HAVE MILLIANS AND BILLIANS AND TRILLIONS D CELLS AND EAST ONLY HAS ONE
Line_4176	THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_4177	I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4178	IT'S THE DIGESTIVE SISTORM FOR HUMANS AND FOR BUTTERFLIES
Line_4179	WE BOTH HAVE SISSTOMS
Line_4180	IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SISTM
Line_4181	ARE TOLD YOU IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMMICK
Line_4182	THE INTESTINES OBSORBED THE WATER AND NEW STREANS
Line_4183	SURE DIGESTIVE SISTOM SELVES THOSE IN THE MAIN POINTS
Line_4184	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_4185	IT IS A LEAF AND VINES
Line_4186	IT'S A PARALLEL LE
Line_4187	IT'S THE HAND MY LEAVE SO IT'S THAT BUG IN ME KITTEN IT'S A HAND POLLEN LEAVE
Line_4188	NE IDEA MEA CHANGE SA LEAF
Line_4189	THE EDGES LOOK LIKE A CHAIN S AND THE VANS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A FEATHER SO MAYBE IT'S A FEATHER CHAN S
Line_4190	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_4191	UM I DON'T KNOW UM IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCULATORY ISTOM
Line_4192	A UH IT SHOWES WATER
Line_4193	UM NOT VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU DOING I
Line_4194	CIRCULATORY SISTOM YEAH YEAH CIRCULATORY SISTOM FOR THE WET
Line_4195	THE GILTORY SISTOM FOR THE WIND I TOLD YOU
Line_4196	HUMAN RESPIRATORY SISTOM IS AIR SISTOM FOR THE WIND
Line_4197	UH O CHI COMES TO THE BODY AND SEE UH TWO COMES OUT OF THE BODY
Line_4198	LUNGS
Line_4199	UH THEY'RE IMPORTANT
Line_4200	IT GIVES ACTION INTO A BLUDSTREEN AND IT TAKES OFF SEOW TWO
Line_4201	IT'S IN FOR PART IN FOR YOUR BLOOD
Line_4202	A
Line_4203	FROM A AND B NO IT WAS A NOT A
Line_4204	THE UM SOLFICGIS
Line_4205	UM I'M DOING OCEAN UM HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4206	I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING I SCIENCE
Line_4207	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY EISTOM
Line_4208	IT HAS A CIGATOR SISTM IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE ARBE AND IT COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE VAN AND THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD
Line_4209	E UH TWO OR CARBON DI OK SIDE
Line_4210	IT'S BLOOD AND THE BLUE PART ARE THE CELLS AND THE BLUE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING OR CARBON BY ACT SIDE
Line_4211	BANDS AND ARTERIES
Line_4212	I DON'T UM CAN I IS UM REPETETHE
Line_4213	IT IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4214	I AM BLOUD COMING IN AND OUT AND A BEING GROWS KIND OF
Line_4215	E HOLD BLOOD
Line_4216	THEY CARRY LOUD THEY CARRY BLOUD
Line_4217	IT'S THE HEART IT PUMPS BLOOD
Line_4218	SE CARRIES THE BLOOD TO THE CELLS
Line_4219	BLOOD TO THE SHELL CARRY BLOOD TO THE SHELLS
Line_4220	IT IS THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM
Line_4221	IT'S BREATHING TO GET ORIGIN TO THE BLUD TO CARRY TO THE CELLS
Line_4222	IT'S BREATHING
Line_4223	IT TAKES OCTREAGEN TO THE BLUD TO
Line_4224	UM IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ORGAN AND WHISPEROTORY S
Line_4225	THERE ARE TWO BS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE SHAKE AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
Line_4226	NO I DON'T KNOW
Line_4227	THE TRICK YEAH IT'S SE STOP BASCKME FOURS
Line_4228	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4229	THEY ALL LIVE ON EARTH THEY ALL ARE THINGS S
Line_4230	IT IS TYPE IT'S A TYPE OF A CHAINS
Line_4231	THERE ARE SUBSYSTEMS IN THE COLOR
Line_4232	THERE IS THINGS THAT ARE LITTLE THAT ARE PARTS THAT GO IN THE SISTOM SO THAT WOULD BE CALLED A SUBSYSTEM
Line_4233	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_4234	YOU CAN SEE PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4235	THE A SHAPE OF THE HEART
Line_4236	THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE HUMAN BODY
Line_4237	THEY'RE INTERACTING PARTS AND
Line_4238	EARTH WHICH IS A SYSTEM
Line_4239	I THINK THE BIOMES FEWER
Line_4240	EVERY THING THAT BIO SPHERE IS MADE OF WATER AND ANIMALS
Line_4241	BECAUSE THE BILE STIR IS IN THOSE PLACES S
Line_4242	THE BOREAL FORIS AND THE WET LANDS
Line_4243	ALL OF THE FOOD WEB'S HAVE A HUMAN BEING IN IT
Line_4244	THAT EVERYTHING COMES FROM THE FUNGI AND THE BACTERIA
Line_4245	IT'S AN ORGANISM GETTING WHEAT IT NEEDS
Line_4246	THEY'RE ADDING IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Line_4247	IT IS BACKETERIEA
Line_4248	NOTHING WELL I DON'T THINK I I DON'T KNOW
Line_4249	WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIVING ORGANISMS AND LIVING THINGS ORGANISMS
Line_4250	ONE OF THEM HAS HAD MORE WATER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4251	GRIPTHIEN
Line_4252	THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND IT IS GROWING
Line_4253	WATER AND SUNLIGHT TO
Line_4254	PLANTS DO NEED WATER JUST ALIVE BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE HUMANS FIELD FOR THEM THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT NEITHER CAN HUMANS
Line_4255	PLANT I NEED WATER TO LIVE AND TO GROW
Line_4256	IT IS SHOWING A PICTURE OF A PLANT AND A WATER DRUMS
Line_4257	AIR YOU CAN'T SEE BUT YOU CAN FEEL
Line_4258	YES I THINK THEY NEED IT MOST OF THE TIMES
Line_4259	THE SUN IS SHINING DOWN ON THE ON THE PLANT
Line_4260	SOME LIGHT TALKED
Line_4261	YES ALIVE
Line_4262	YES DEFINITELY
Line_4263	UM THIS IS A BURGERS
Line_4264	YES YEP
Line_4265	ACTING SUD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE L OR ELSE THE WILD OLD WORK LIKE IT IS
Line_4266	IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE PEOPLE PLANTS NEED FOOD TO SURVIVE
Line_4267	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IT SHOWS
Line_4268	NOT
Line_4269	WELL NO BECAUSE FRTALIZER CAN KILL THEM WHICH I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
Line_4270	IT'S A HOUSE
Line_4271	NO LAMPS DO NOT ON EACH SHELTER TWO CIR
Line_4272	GRE- HOW ARE YOU
Line_4273	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT'S IN YOUR BODY
Line_4274	WE'VE BEEN TALKING A THE HUMAN BODY AND
Line_4275	THEY BOTH HAVE SIMILAR BLOOD CELLS I MEAN CELLS NOT BLOOD CELLS CELL
Line_4276	UM IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4277	I SEE BLUE SHELLS THEN I SEE BLUE KIND OF SHORT SQUIGLY LINES
Line_4278	THEY'RE ALL KIND OF TOGETHER THEY NEVER FLOW APART FROM EACH OTHER THAT KIND OF LIKE A PAR
Line_4279	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4280	UM I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
Line_4281	THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH THERE ARE VERY VERY MANY OF THEM UH
Line_4282	THE SOLID IS TRANSFERS THE BROKEN UP PIECES OF FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMMICK
Line_4283	THE SOFFICAS PLACE A BIG ROLE IN THE DYJESTICISTM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FOOD GETS DOWN TO THE UM STUMMICK
Line_4284	TO TAKE THE FOOD AND BRING IT UP INTO PIECES AND TO MAKE SURE TRANSVERSE TO THE SMALL INTESTINE T
Line_4285	OH THAT IT PUTS IT INTO ALL THE WASTE IT PUTS IT IN THE WASTE AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4286	WHEN THE COOKIE GETS WET IT TURNS INTO E
Line_4287	MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE A A TYPE OF PLANT
Line_4288	RES AND IT'S IT IT'S GRASS AND IT'S TIP OP IT'S A TIP PLANT
Line_4289	ON THE LEFT THE GRASS IS A A LITTLE MORE DECAYED
Line_4290	BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF PLANT BUT ONE OF THEM IS MORE DICATED THAN THE OTHER
Line_4291	ONE UM HAS PROBABLY NOT GOT IN AS MUCH WATER
Line_4292	THE PLANTS ALSO HAVE BUBBLE NEEDS LIKE UM OF WATER AND AND S
Line_4293	THE SOME AND WATER
Line_4294	YES THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE AND BECAUSE UM AND WHENEVER SOMETHING IS HIDRATED IT WILL IT WILL DIE
Line_4295	I I THINK THEY DO NEED WATER BECAUSE UM IT OH PRET MUCH EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS WATER SO HAS TO SURVIVE WITHOUT IT WE'D ALL D HIDRAT AND DIE
Line_4296	ALL LIVING THINGS NEED AIR TO BREATHE
Line_4297	YES UM EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS AIR TO SURVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T BREATHE AND THEY JUST TOP
Line_4298	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK PENS DO NEED AIR BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY'D ALL JUST THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE AND THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4299	PLANTS NEEDS MATES OR SURVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE UM THEY'D BE TOO COLD AND THEY AND THEN THEY THEY WOULD DIE
Line_4300	YES CLISE THEN THEY'D UM GET TOO COLD AND DIE
Line_4301	I SEE A PICTURE OF A HAMBURGAR AND A PLANT
Line_4302	YES IT WOULD DIE OF HUNGER AND UM AND THERE WOULD BE NO N
Line_4303	WITH THAT UM TEN TO HAVE A FLAT UM IT PRANCE WILL DIE
Line_4304	IT YES IF PLANTS DON'T GET FOOD THEY JUST D
Line_4305	A SOME KIND OF CAN AND WITH A PICTURE OF AN APPLE AN
Line_4306	YES UM BECAUSE IT'S A PIC SO SOIL AND GRAMS NEED TO BE PUT IN SOIL JUST ARVIVE
Line_4307	IT'S NOT NEEDED BUT IT'S A HELP HELPFUL THING OR PLANTS
Line_4308	UHM IT'S A HOUSE WHICH COULD BE A TYPE OF SHELTER FOR A PLANT
Line_4309	PENCIL FILTER WHEN IT'S LIKE COLD DURING LIKE THE WINTER AND OTHER TIME
Line_4310	I THINK THEY DO NEED UM SHELTER TO SURVIVE LATER OTHERWISE UM DURING THE WINTER THE JUST FREE UP AND DIE
Line_4311	IT SHOWS THAT UM PLANT NEED TO MATE WATER AND THEN WHAT WATER CAN EVAPORATE FROM IT UM
Line_4312	BECAUSE IT'S THERE MEAN UM SORT UM NEEDS FOR SERVIVEL AND THE WITHOUT IT THEY UM JUST STOP
Line_4313	THE GIRL AND IT A UM FEET ON HEY ENERGY
Line_4314	THEY DO MIX THEIR FOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
Line_4315	IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUN
Line_4316	IT DOESN'T IT DIDN'T GET AND IT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH SUN IT
Line_4317	UM IT WON'T GET ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4318	UHM IT LOOKS MORE MUCH MORE DECAYED AND UM YEAH AND ORANGE AND UM SICKLY BECAUSE IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND WATER BUT NO AIR
Line_4319	IT GETS ENOUGH WATER AND SOME AID BUT NOT ENOUGH AIR
Line_4320	IT MAKES IT DECAY EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES WITHOUT SUNLIGHT
Line_4321	UM IT LOOKS SICKLY TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER
Line_4322	IT HAS NOT BEGINNING TO GET ANY WATER BUT IT'S BEEN GETTING AIR AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4323	UM WITH OUT WATER NAIL IT WILL DOT
Line_4324	IT THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK SICKLY IT LOOKS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER SUNLIGHT AND AIR
Line_4325	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF WATER MATE OR HAIR
Line_4326	UM THIS ONE HAS ENOUGH WATER AIR AND SUN
Line_4327	THE PLANT IS STICKING HEALTHY
Line_4328	THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FEED ON EACH OTHER AND THERE ARE COMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_4329	UH I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4330	THEY'RE A PART OF THE LITER OF FEED WEB
Line_4331	UM WITH THE BOUT PRODUCERS UM THE FLIDWEMS WOULD JUST START FALLING UP ON
Line_4332	THE STU WITH THEM COMPOSERS THEN PRODUCERS THEN THEY END WITH CONSUMERS
Line_4333	THE MAN'S NEED UH FOOD AND WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SHELTER OR FIRTALIZED
Line_4334	UM THE HUMAN AND THE EAST ARE BOTH MADE OF SO THEY ARE DIFFERENT TIPS OR CELLS BUT THEY'RE STILL SO
Line_4335	UM PLANTS ARE NOT SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS THEY HAVE MORE THE ONES SO
Line_4336	UM HUMANS ALSO HAVE SEVERAL A LOT OF S
Line_4337	THERE ARE BRAINS SO AND WHICH ARE UH DIFFERENT
Line_4338	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT IT'S THAT THESE THE THESE ARE BRAINS SO
Line_4339	I SEE SKIN CELLS WHICH ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM BRAIN CELLS AND MOST S
Line_4340	THAT SOME SINGLES ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BODY
Line_4341	DON'T THINK SO
Line_4342	ONE
Line_4343	NOT THE NEG
Line_4344	THAT THE YE
Line_4345	I DON'T THINK SO I
Line_4346	YEAH UH
Line_4347	I DON'T KNOW THERE'S TEN THAT GETS
Line_4348	IMORTAL AND HOW YE
Line_4349	UH WHEN YOU STARTING HORN ABOUT LIVING SYSTEM
Line_4350	THEY ALL INTERACT WITH PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SO THEY WORK SO THAT'S WHOLE THING EXPLAIN
Line_4351	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKES THE CAR WORK
Line_4352	AND INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE A SMOVE
Line_4353	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4354	THE INTERACTING SUBSISTOMES THAT MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4355	ALS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE HUMAN BODY WORK
Line_4356	IT HAS LOTS OF SUBSYSTEMS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE IF WORKS CORRECTLY
Line_4357	THEY INTERACT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE EARTH LIKE
Line_4358	I SEE THE HIDROLIC SYSTEM THE
Line_4359	THERE IS THE EGOEGOSIYSTOM
Line_4360	THE IRE SPEER IS LIVING THING
Line_4361	BY SPEER IS ALL THE WATER AND THE WORLD
Line_4362	E GO CISTOM IS LIVE ON THE BRO SPEER BECAUSE BRO SPEER IS WATER AND WE NEED TO LIVE WITH WA
Line_4363	HUMAN BODY FISH EDIN SOR WHATEVER
Line_4364	THIS IS THE ONE OF THE EAGLE CYSTOMS FOR FORISTESTHIS ALSO SHOWS A FULL CHAIN
Line_4365	HOW PREDATORS EAT THERE IS SMALLER THINGS
Line_4366	SOMETHING EATS SOMETHING THE THING THAT GETS EAT ENERGY TRANSFERS INTO A THING THAT WEIGHT IT
Line_4367	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIFE CYCLES PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS ARE ALL PART OF THE LIFE CYCLES
Line_4368	IT MAKES HIS UM FOOD BYE FOO SIMPLY
Line_4369	THEY DO NOT EAT OTHER ORGANS
Line_4370	THE BACTERIA FUNGI PINE TREE AND GRASS
Line_4371	YOU EAT OTHER LIVING ORGANISM
Line_4372	THEY EAT OTHER LIVING ORGAN
Line_4373	THE RABBIT SANDIMENT SAND SALAMANDER BEADLE SPARROW RED TILEDHOCK AND SNIC
Line_4374	IT EATS DEAD ORGANISMS
Line_4375	THE FONGIE AND THE BACK THE'RE
Line_4376	IT'S ABOUT WHAT PLANS AND ANIMALS EAT
Line_4377	IT'S A DEER AND RABBIT ARE BEFORE
Line_4378	YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT
Line_4379	THEY EAT MEATS OR DECAYING MEATS AND BERRIES OR D CARRYING ME
Line_4380	A KIND OF OR OR AN RIVLE
Line_4381	UH ERUBIVORE
Line_4382	THEY BREAK DOWN THE BAD DECAYING MATTER AND MAKE IT SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE EARTH AND A SOIL
Line_4383	ADDING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SISTIOM
Line_4384	IT HAS TO DO WITH THE EAST THING THE FIEST WILL GROW
Line_4385	IT'S WATCHING EACH GROW OUT OF ITS DORMANT STAGE E
Line_4386	I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO GET USED OUT OF IT'S DORMANT STAGE
Line_4387	I THINK THE SALTS ARE OF THE
Line_4388	WE'VE BEEN DOING AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHICH TO SEE IF WE WILL GO IN DARK BAGS AND WE WILL GO IN LIGHT BAGS
Line_4389	THE UN HEALTHY LOOKING ONE WAS GROWN IN THE DARK BAGS
Line_4390	SHOWING IS HOW FU HOW THE PLANTS FOUD IS PRODUCED
Line_4391	CARBON DIOACSIDE SUNLIGHT WATER
Line_4392	NEEDS NE TRENDS TO SURVIVE
Line_4393	IT SHOWS A CAN WITH THE TIME TO ONE
Line_4394	THERE IS A HOUSE AND A S HOW NICE
Line_4395	IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT SIMFASICE WORKS AND AND WHAT SIMFHAICE NEEDS TO WOR
Line_4396	SO THEY COULD GET FILLED FROM BOTTLES AND SAID
Line_4397	IT CRIPPLED IT AND IT'S DRYING
Line_4398	THE PLANT NEEDS ALL THREE THINGS TO SURVIVE AND MAKES IT'S OWN ENERGY
Line_4399	IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS IT NEEDS FOR TO CHEVARVE SO IT IS GROWING QUITE NICEELY
Line_4400	IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE
Line_4401	EVENTUALLY THE ENERGY FROM THE PLANTS COMES UP TO HOCKS IGLES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_4402	SHALLOW HALLOW AND GOOD BI
Line_4403	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CISTOMS AND SUB CISTOMS
Line_4404	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LAND DIRECTING PARTS
Line_4405	IT HAS DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4406	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS HOW DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4407	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT HELP IT WORK AND IF IF ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS WEREN'T THERE IT WOULDN'T
Line_4408	ALL OF THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4409	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY PARTS THAT MAKES THE BODY WORK
Line_4410	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS S
Line_4411	IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND SELF SISTOMS LIKE ANIVBULS AND HUMANS IN PLANTS
Line_4412	TALKING ABOUT CISTMS AND IT'S ALSO
Line_4413	ABOUT SISITUMS AND SLIP STU
Line_4414	BECAUSE THEY HAVE MANY ATTRACTING APART
Line_4415	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKES IT BE OVER THE MIDDLE AND THE CONTRACTING PARTS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S MAKING IT WORKS
Line_4416	IT HAS MANY DISTANT INTERRECTING PARTS THAT CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO THE WHOLE BODY A
Line_4417	WELL WITH OUT ANY OF THESE THE THE WHOLE SYSTOM MOTIVE WORK
Line_4418	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY ATTRACTING PARTS AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE ATTRACTING PARTS IT WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE IS
Line_4419	UM AND
Line_4420	I DO HERE IS ABOUT PLANTS UNIT FISHES AND WATERS
Line_4421	THEY SHOW WHAT ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER AND WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS IN THE O
Line_4422	IT'S GOING GOOD I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4423	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE CIRFISES
Line_4424	WE PUT WAX PAPER ON THE BLUE CIRFICE
Line_4425	WATER SLIDES DOWN A SLOPE
Line_4426	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER TO ONE DROP AND LESS WATER TO ANOTHER DROP AND THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS S
Line_4427	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THIS SLOPE
Line_4428	WE DID NOT USE THE ROCKS OR THE PAPER CLIP BUT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BOTH SUNK
Line_4429	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_4430	KIND OF BLENDED WITH THE OTHER WATER BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOT IT STIRRED OR MIXED A BY ACCIDENT
Line_4431	COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN R UM TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT EITHER STICKS IN THE VILE OR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_4432	WE I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING WITH ICE AND WATER
Line_4433	THEY COULD BE LIQUIDS
Line_4434	WHEN WATER COOLS IT GETS DENSERS
Line_4435	UM DENSITY IS MAKING THE WATER LEVEL DROP BELOW RUM TEMPERATURE
Line_4436	ICE IS ACTUALLY LESS DENSE THAN WATER BECAUSE IT FLOWS
Line_4437	THAT TELLS ME THAT WHEN THAT THE COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN A REGULAR WATER
Line_4438	OR WATER CREATES LESS DENSITY SO THAT'S PACICALLY WHAT IT DOES
Line_4439	WHEN YOU PUT WATER IN THE FREEZER IT TAKES MORE SPACE AND IT BECOMES A SOLID
Line_4440	IT GETS LESS DENSE CAUSING THE WATER TO RISES
Line_4441	WATER TAKES UP MORE SPACE AS IT IS HEATED
Line_4442	IT MEANS TO SOLITIFIES I THINK
Line_4443	H WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EVAPORATING OVER TIME
Line_4444	IT TURNS OUT MY MY CRIFONE WAS NOT IN THE PROPER POSITION SO THAT'S WHY YOU COULDN'T DEAR ME BUT I COULD HEAR YOU
Line_4445	THE UNCOVERED WE PAPER TOWELS
Line_4446	HAS MORE WATER IN IT BECAUSE THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS COMPLETELY EVAPORATED
Line_4447	THE WEIGHT PAPER TOWELS DID WHEAT BECAUSE T PLASTIC LID IS SELLING IN THE HUMINITY
Line_4448	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4449	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EXPOSED TO HEAT WHICH CAUSES EVAPORATION
Line_4450	THE WATER ON THE SCIRFISE IS TOUCHING THE AIR CAUSING IT TO BE ABLE TO EVAPORATE
Line_4451	THE WATER ON THE SCIRFICE IS EVAPORATING
Line_4452	WHEN WATER PAPER TOUCHES A COLD CUP IT FORMS CONDENSATION WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST
Line_4453	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS REALLY COLD
Line_4454	I THINK THE DROP ARE THE WATER ON THE LID ARE WATER DROP LITS SO THAT BASICALLY IS
Line_4455	THE WATER DROP LITS FORMED INSIDE THE CONDENSATION CHAMBER SO IT BASICALLY S
Line_4456	WE OBSERVED THAT THE CONDENSATION WAS IN THE INSIDE WITH OUR ACTUAL CONDENSATION CHAMBER S
Line_4457	THE WATER HAS TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE CUP BUT WITH LID IT DEFIES EVAPORATION
Line_4458	IT IS REALLY COAL BECAUSE IT JUST A MASSES ME
Line_4459	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOIL AND GRAVEL
Line_4460	I I SEE A PILE OF SOIL AND A PILE OF GRAVEL
Line_4461	I I KNOW THAT WATER CAN FLOW SEE SOIL AND WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH GRAVEL
Line_4462	BY WHAT DO AS WELL THEY ACT THEY ACT DIFFERENTLY WITH EACH OTHERS
Line_4463	WATER CAN SPIN WATER WE ALL TO MAKE UH
Line_4464	FIVE OF THE RED THINGS THREE OF THE Y
Line_4465	IT IS WHAT A MELL WHICH HELPS POWER THE HOUSE AND YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THIS QUESTION
Line_4466	D SPACICALLY WHAT WE DID AND IT
Line_4467	UM FORCE ANOTHER BLADE IS RIGHT THERE SO THAT KEEPS IT SPINNING AS LONG AS THERE IS FLOW OF WATER
Line_4468	MY MARNEY I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU
Line_4469	I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4470	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND UM ITS PROPERTIES
Line_4471	THE WATER IS MAKING BEADS ON THE ALUMINIUM FOIL
Line_4472	THE PAPER TAIL HAS OBSERVED THE WATER
Line_4473	THE PAPER ALL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER LEAVING A TINY MARK
Line_4474	THE SMALLER DROP LITES CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A BIGGER DROP LIT
Line_4475	WAIT ARE ON DIFFERENT CIRFICES CAN
Line_4476	THE WATER OR THE PAPER PAIL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER
Line_4477	THE SALTY WATER DECREASES TO I TENSION WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIRFACE TENSION
Line_4478	THE CAUSING THE WATER TO NOT RISES HIGH WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE SURFACE TENSIONS
Line_4479	YES A DROP LITS OF WATER ARE COMING OUT
Line_4480	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH WATER
Line_4481	CIRFIEPENTION IS HAPPENING
Line_4482	CUIRFICE TENSION IS THE PROPERTY THAT KEEPS WATER TOGETHER AND NOT IN A THIN LINE
Line_4483	SALT WATER HAD NO EFFECT AND IT ACTS LIKE PLAIN WATER
Line_4484	THE DOL TO BUL S HI
Line_4485	MARNE I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4486	UM THE BULB STARTED AT THE SIDE OF THE DESK AND WE DROPPED IT WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4487	BECAUSE ALL EVERYONE
Line_4488	I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE TWO DAY
Line_4489	THE BULB AND THEN UM
Line_4490	HOW MANY NUMBERS OF OF SWINGS I THERE ARE
Line_4491	AND UM PUT EITHER ONE OF THEM ON THE STICK AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4492	YOU PUT THEM IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER STICKS THAT ARE GLOWED ON TO THE FLIPPER BRACE ER THE THE FLIPPER STICK
Line_4493	IT HELPS IT UHM
Line_4494	WELL IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A BULB SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4495	I UH I DON'T KNOW WHICH TALKING ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE REALLY MUCH SENSE I
Line_4496	UM FILLING FITTING SO
Line_4497	THE REASON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IT
Line_4498	LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT'S GOING TO DO WHEN TEN SECANDS AND YEAH
Line_4499	THE PENDULUM LAND
Line_4500	UM IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWITCH LIKE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM IS DOING
Line_4501	MAKING A ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
Line_4502	IT WON'T IT WON'T IT WOULD STINK FASTER THAN IT WOULD IF YOU HAD A CUP THAT'S UM A L BIT LONGER
Line_4503	MAY NOT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS IT COULD HOLD I GUESS
Line_4504	UM CAPACITY GOES UP YOU WHOLE IT HOLDS LIKE MORE PACONGERS
Line_4505	OH THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS THE MORE YOU'RE DOING THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE IT'S GO NOT GO
Line_4506	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_4507	YOU WOULD PROBABLY COUNT LIKE BY TEN ARE FIVE MAYBE
Line_4508	THE S UH THE EX AXIS TELLS US HOW MANY RUBBER BANDS LIGHT THERE ARE
Line_4509	THE MORE RIVER HANDS THERE ARE THE FURTHER IT'S GOING IT'S GOING TO GO
Line_4510	IT'S GOING UP I
Line_4511	THAT IT'S GOING DOWN INSTEAD OF GOING UP
Line_4512	UM THEY'RE ABOUT UM LIKE HOW THINGS LIKE HOW THEY MOVE LIKE HOW THEY KEEP ON SPINNING
Line_4513	IT'S A PENDULUM AND THE PENNY IS WHAT KEEPS IT SPINNING
Line_4514	HIT KEEPS ON SPINNING AT THE SAME LEVEL
Line_4515	UM H ONE WILL SWING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN SLOW DOWN TWO WILL GO LONGER AND THEN SO ON SO
Line_4516	UH THE THIRTY EIGHT ONE IT WILL SWING FAR
Line_4517	IT'LL SWING EAT SWINGS FOR IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4518	SO THE SHORTER ONES UM SWUNG LONGER AND THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER
Line_4519	UH THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY SWING THE LEAST AMOUNT
Line_4520	UM TODAY WE STARTED UH MAKING UM CATAPULTS
Line_4521	UM IT'S IT'S GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING
Line_4522	UM THE THE PAPER CLIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU COULDN'T FLIP ANYTHING WITH IT
Line_4523	UM ON THIS THERE IS UM UH JUST A PLAIN CORK LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE RUBBER CORK
Line_4524	UH YOU WOULD DESCRIBE THE FLIP STICK ABOUT UM
Line_4525	M TWENTY SEVEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4526	UM M WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING P PENDULUMS AND WE STARTED DOING UM GRAMS ABOUT THEM TODAY
Line_4527	UHM YOU IT WOULDN'T BE A CONTROLLED VARIABLE
Line_4528	UH WELL THIS ONE IS ABOUT UM HOW LONG THE STRING IS AND HOW MANY UM SWINGS IT DID
Line_4529	THE SHORTEST LENGTHS OF STRING IS SWINGING THE MOST AND THEN THE LONGEST STRING IS SWINGING THE LEAST
Line_4530	COULD YOU YOU USE UM A GRAFT AND YEAH
Line_4531	UM ON THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4532	UM WE STARTED TODAY LEARNING ABOUT LIKE ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4533	WELL WE FIRST PUT THE BOAT IN WITH NO NO PENNIES ON IT
Line_4534	UM MAYBE YOUR MAKING THE BOAT HIGHER OR LONGER TO FIT MORE PEOPLE IN
Line_4535	THE BOAT WOULD HIT THE BOTTOM AND LIKE JUST COMES RIGHT BACK UP WITHOUT GETTING WATER IN IT
Line_4536	UM YOU COULD DON'T IT'S CONTROLLING A GOOD VARIABLE IS WHEN U UM ONLY SWITCH ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4537	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4538	UM THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4539	UM IT IS TELLING YOU THE NUMBERS OF THE CUP AND HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_4540	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND UH FLYING THEM ON FISHING WIRE
Line_4541	UM YOU WANT TO
Line_4542	SE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4543	UH A NUMBER OF WINDS
Line_4544	UM SO THE THE ONES WITH OUT THE PAPER CLIPS GOES THE FARTHEST AND THE ONES WITH THE MOST PAPER CLIP CLIPS GOES THE LEAST T
Line_4545	UM THAT IF YOU DID CHANGED THEM IT WOULD AFFECT HOW IT FLIES
Line_4546	UM I WANTED TO FIGUER OUT IF IF YOU HAD MORE ON UM HOW WOULD IT AFFECT HOW IT FLOWS
Line_4547	CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED ALL OF THE ALL THE VAR- MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4548	HOW FAR THE D IS I MEAN JUST THE DISTANCE
Line_4549	UH THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS
Line_4550	UM WE WERE TRYING TO FIBER OUT IF THE DISTANCE GOES UP WHEN WE ADD PASANGERS OR IF IT GOES DOWN WHEN WE ADD PASANGERS
Line_4551	UH WELL YOU HAVE TO YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME OR ELSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4552	M YOU'D GET MORE ACCURATE ANSWERS AND THINGS
Line_4553	UM THE MORTAR WHICH IS THE WATER VANCE AND THE DISTANCE
Line_4554	UM UM THE Y AXIS UM IT SHOWS THE THE DICERNCE THE PLANE FLEW
Line_4555	I DON'T KNOW WHAT A INDEPENANT OR UH INDEPENDENT VERIBLE IS
Line_4556	I NOTICE THAT UM INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BEFORE AND THE INDEPENDENT VERILES IS WHAT WE LEARNED
Line_4557	U WILL FIND THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE Y AXIS
Line_4558	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAS PA YOU SAID
Line_4559	UM THIS POINT IS UM KEPT STICKING THE SAME SO IT THAT MAKES IT A STRATLINE
Line_4560	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING UM THE FLIPPER BASE AND UM WE DID THE GRAMS SO THAT
Line_4561	UM THIS SPACE IT STICK IT IN SO THAT YOU COULD BALANCE THE QUICK
Line_4562	UM IT UM GROWS THE ONE UM AND THE TWO EM AND THREE EM
Line_4563	UM YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S UM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THE TO THE OPPOSITE WAY LIKE FROM
Line_4564	UM I NOTICE STERS WHERE BY CORK CORK A WOODENMBULE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THEM ARE
Line_4565	I SEE THAT THE PLASTIC BULP IS POINTING ON THE WALL AND IT BOUNTS BACK
Line_4566	O I THINK YOU ARE READY SHOW ME THIS PICTURE
Line_4567	IT HAS TO HIGH THE HEIGHT SO THAT CAN HELP IT LIKE TO UM GO FARTHER
Line_4568	UM PADIODIUM LENS AND NUMBER OF SWAINS
Line_4569	UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE UM THE LENGTH AND THE SCREEN
Line_4570	IT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF STRINGS UH EITHER LOWING LARGER OR SMALLER
Line_4571	I'VE JUST BEEN DOING THE SWINGS THAT YOU PUT ONE STRAIN DOWN AND MAKES SOMETHING SWINGS
Line_4572	IT'S IT GRAM AND WE BAR
Line_4573	THE NUMBER OF STRANGER SWITCHES FROM TEN TO TO HUNDRED
Line_4574	ABOUT THE HEIGHT AND WHICH IS THE CAP HAS A CAPACITY
Line_4575	I DON'T GET IT I CAN LIKE THE AN
Line_4576	UH I TRIED TO CLICK BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_4577	I KNOW THAT UH D IS WILL BE BIGGER AND
Line_4578	AND A WILL BE SMALLER BUT THAT UM THOUGH THEY'RE LIKE ALL THE SAME HEIGHT IS THREE CENTIMETERS
Line_4579	YOU SHE ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE A THAT'S TIME TWO SEE IT'S DIFFERENT NOT CHANGE LIKE THREE OR FORE VARIBLES AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT
Line_4580	I THINK YOU ARE A SHOWING THIS UM A PICTURE
Line_4581	M OF COURSE IF THE WATER IS MOVING I THINK THE PENNY WILL TIPPED OR THE WATER WILL GO IN
Line_4582	TODAY ME AND MY PARTNER JUST MAKE THE PLANT SO
Line_4583	NO WE DIDN'T GET TO PUT THE FISH ON TO OUR PLAN
Line_4584	YOU PRESS E MEAN THAT QUESTION
Line_4585	UM ARM THE STRING IS STRATER AND WARM THE STRAINER COLUZER
Line_4586	S I THINK THIS ONLY HAS ONE THERE ABOUT CHANGED
Line_4587	UM WELL I THINK YOU CAN UM SLIT MORE ON THIRSTAYS AND DON'T GUESS SLEEP B ON FRIDAYS
Line_4588	UM JUST EX ME THAT UM IT'S A MINUTE YOU GO
Line_4589	WE CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS UM WE DO TWO FOR SIX A TEN
Line_4590	YOU CHANGED THE PAPER CLOSER IN THIS EXAMPLE
Line_4591	T I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4592	IT'S ABOUT AM IT'S A GRAM AND THERE'S A WIRE AND EX AXIS S
Line_4593	THAT'S TO SEE HOW YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE WIRE X AXIS IS THEN
Line_4594	YOU ALREADY ASK ME THAT QUESTIONS
Line_4595	YEAH THE NUMBER OF PASCANDERS IS THE VARIABLE ON THIS TABLE OF DATA
Line_4596	YOU OR D ASKED ME THAT
Line_4597	THINGS FOR ALL YOU'RE HELP TOO
Line_4598	SAME WITH YEAH BIG
Line_4599	WE GOT DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRING S AND SEEING HOW MANY SWINGS IT WOULD MAKE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4600	WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG PIECE OF STRING YOU'LL HAVE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS AND FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4601	THERE IS A WHOLE BENCH ON PENDULUMS
Line_4602	IN FIFTEEN SECRANDS IT DID FIVE SWINGS
Line_4603	A PENNY AND A PAPERCLIP AND A STRING
Line_4604	THE BULB MAKES THE TREND SWEEN
Line_4605	THE LONGER THE STRING FLY THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM WILL MAKE
Line_4606	WE JUST FINISHED UP THE PENDULUM EXBAROIMENT
Line_4607	IT'S ABOUT THE PENDULUM LENGTH AND THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PEDULA MAKES
Line_4608	O CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF SOME THINGS
Line_4609	WHEN YOU USE A GRAB IT TELLS YOU DATA
Line_4610	WHEN YOU USE THE GRAFT TO HELP YOU PRODICT YOU CAN GET A BETTER CONCLUSION
Line_4611	WITH THE TWENTY LITER STRING YOU WILL GET FIFTEEN SWEENS
Line_4612	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BULB S
Line_4613	R PAPER BITES AND WE ARE SEEN HOW MUCH CAPACITY AND PACANGERS ABOUT CAN HOLD
Line_4614	HEY ARE LIVE FUELS BUT WE NEED THEM OUT OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4615	THERE WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT IT WE JUST TESTED TO SEE HOW I WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT DIDN'T
Line_4616	IF YOU PUT TOO MANY POP PENNIES IN ONE BOUT IT
Line_4617	WELL IF YOU STACCLED THE PENIES
Line_4618	OKAY THANK YOU BIN
Line_4619	WE FINISHED MAKING OUR BOATS AND THEN WE GRAED ALL OUR BOATS PLUS A TWO OTHERS
Line_4620	IT TOLD ME WHY THE
Line_4621	YOU ASK ME THAT QUESTION LAST TIME ALIKE THE LAST THING YOU SAID
Line_4622	THE PLAIN IS MOVING ACROSS THE STREETN
Line_4623	WOULD SEE THAT YOU'RE PLAIN WON'T FLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
Line_4624	WE ONLY FLOW AT ONE DISTANCE THAT IS TWO YARDS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO T ANY OTHER DISTANCES
Line_4625	ONE PLAIN IS GOING ON A STRAIT STRING AND THE OTHER PLAIN IS LIKE DOING IN LIKE A DIAGONAL
Line_4626	I LIKE VISIT IN WITH YOU TO TWO
Line_4627	ANDS AND CRAP
Line_4628	WELL ON THE GRASS WE COULD
Line_4629	UM WELL THE PEN E VARIABLE WOULD BE LIKE YES SWITCH ONE VARIABLE AT THE TIME
Line_4630	THANK YOU
Line_4631	ARE WE OUT OF TIME ER NOT T
Line_4632	PUT I TAPED IT ON THE THE BULB AND SWUNG IT THREE TIMES
Line_4633	UH TO PINE NEUMECRAF
Line_4634	HELP YOU WITH A MASS
Line_4635	SWEEN LIKE OH AND SWAIN
Line_4636	LU CHA
Line_4637	UM STRING WILL GO LONGER IT THINK
Line_4638	I I DON'T GET IT
Line_4639	IN SCIENCE I COULDN'T THINK IT AN SO I DON'T CHANGE ANY
Line_4640	WAS ABOUT TESTING YOUR PAPER'S TO SEE HOW FAR IT WANT
Line_4641	THE ANGLE AND THE DISTANCE THE OR FLEW
Line_4642	UM THAT THE BULL ON THE TOP IS BIGGER AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS A
Line_4643	IT SAYS THAT THEY BOTH EAT ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4644	THE AINGA
Line_4645	OBJECT AND A MASS LENGTH DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE
Line_4646	UH SO CLAY
Line_4647	BECAUSE MAYBE OTHER THINGS WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE GRAMS
Line_4648	DO MAN DIFFERENT THINGS EVERY TIME
Line_4649	I I DON'T GET IT
Line_4650	WE WERE DOING THE PLAINS AND MAKING GRAPHS AND TESTING THEM
Line_4651	A SCREEN WITH PAPER CLIP AND THEN A PENNY
Line_4652	STRING PAPER CLIP AND PEN
Line_4653	I I NOTICED THAT THE SMALL ONE DID THE MOST
Line_4654	THE BIG ONE THERE'S THE LESS I MEAN TO THE MEDIUM
Line_4655	NOT SURE I'M NOT T
Line_4656	STRAINED PAPER CLIPS PENNY
Line_4657	L LONGER OR SHORTER STRENGTH
Line_4658	LONG OR C RICH STRING I
Line_4659	SMALLER OR DIFFERENT PAPER CLIP
Line_4660	SMALLER PENNY SMALLER KIND OF COIN OR PAPER CLIPS OR MORE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4661	A PENDULUM WITH A STRING A PAPER CLIP AND PENNY AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4662	LIKE A BOAT S
Line_4663	THEY ARE MADE OF CUPS
Line_4664	THEY'RE MADE A THEY'RE MADE OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4665	WE GOT A PAPER CUPS AND WE FOUND A DICTIONARY AND WE
Line_4666	WE MADE LINES ON THE CUP AND WE CUT WHERE THAT WAS TO MAKE BOTH
Line_4667	SMALL EATING TAKE
Line_4668	THEY'RE BOAT'S
Line_4669	PUTTING DIM OR PENNIES FOR PASCANGERS AND THE BOAT
Line_4670	FOR MY BOLTS SMALL WAYS SEVEN MEDIUM AT BIG WAS TWENTY FIVE TO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4671	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
Line_4672	PACANGERS IN BOLTS
Line_4673	THE ONE WITH THE TWENTY HAS MORE THAN THE ONE THE TWELVE
Line_4674	BOATS WITH PACANGERS EH PENNIES
Line_4675	MAKE IT AN EXTRA BOAT
Line_4676	MAKE IT NEAR CAMPACITY
Line_4677	GOOD
Line_4678	MEASURING THE MASS AND THE VOLUME OF THINGS I
Line_4679	FIFTY MILLILITERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SMALLER CIRCUI-
Line_4680	A GRADUATED SOILINDER
Line_4681	IT GOES UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE CAN ONLY GOES UP TO FIFTY
Line_4682	SO LIKE IF YOU POURED WATER IN YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER YOU HAVE
Line_4683	YOU MEASURED THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4684	THE- THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4685	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_4686	WELL FIFTY MILLILITERS IS A
Line_4687	WHAT- IS CAPACITY
Line_4688	IT HOLD I UM THE CAPACITY OF IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4689	WOULDN'T DO AS MEASURING A WATER WITH THREE CUPS
Line_4690	HOW HOT OR COLD THE WATER IS
Line_4691	WHAT IS THE HOTTEST AND WHAT IS THE COLDEST
Line_4692	UM KNOWING WE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_4693	WELL YOUR FINGER CAN'T TELL THE EXACT TEMPERATURE BUT A THERMOMETER CAN
Line_4694	WHAT A STANDARD TOOL
Line_4695	SLIPS AND FAR IN HEIGHT
Line_4696	WELL YOU COULD USE FAIR AN HOW YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO USE ELSE'S UNLESS YOU LIKE NEED TO
Line_4697	IT GETS COLDER
Line_4698	WELL IT'S FIFTY DEGREES CEL CUTS AND IT'S MOREMAR THAN TEN DEGREES CELS
Line_4699	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT CAN'T BE HIRER THAN FIFTY
Line_4700	H WELL I
Line_4701	OH ABOUT WHAT H
Line_4702	WELL EVERY MINE WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_4703	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVE MEANS I
Line_4704	UH OKAY
Line_4705	WE USED THE CHART
Line_4706	THE TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_4707	IN HOTTER IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE GETTING COLDER AND IT MIGHT BE GETTING HOTTER
Line_4708	IT DROPPED WAPIDLY
Line_4709	YOU A OH HEY WELL
Line_4710	PILLYBUB-JEOW BILLY BILLY HI HI
Line_4711	YEAH IT DOGS
Line_4712	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4713	ABOUT MEASURING THINGS
Line_4714	UHM IN CLASS WE USED STRAWS WHICH WAS KIND OF HARD
Line_4715	I THINK MY FRIEND NICKEL IS MAYBE A METER A THINK
Line_4716	TO THAT IT'S LIKE THE DOORKNOB FROM A DOOR YEAH NECK IS REALLY SHORT
Line_4717	YOU COULD YOU COULD USE YOUR UM YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB A TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4718	AND LIKE GUESSING
Line_4719	YOU SPREAD YOUR HANDS APART WITH YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB
Line_4720	UM NOT EXACTLY SHORT
Line_4721	MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE AND LIKE EXACT
Line_4722	I AM A HOW ARE YOU
Line_4723	I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_4724	U MOST LIKELY A METER STICK
Line_4725	NOT SOURCE
Line_4726	TO MAKE SURE LIKE YOU PUT IT YOU HAVE IT STRAIGHT AND T ALL LIKE FAT AND FOLDED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4727	WE MEASURED OUR ARMS OUR WRIST TO OUR ELBOW OUR FOIT AND OUR HEIGHT
Line_4728	WE DON'T MEASURE UH NO SIS
Line_4729	MAYBE A FOOT T
Line_4730	YOU ARE USING YOUR PINKIE FOR EACH CENTIMETER
Line_4731	I DON'T KNOW SO
Line_4732	NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME FOR ME AT LEAST MAYBE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE SOME ARE THE SAME
Line_4733	THAT HIS ARMS AND HIS HEIGHT ARE THE EXACT SAME
Line_4734	SOME ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS BODY PARTS AND SOME ARE SMALLER
Line_4735	UH TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4736	U COULD USE YOUR THUMB AND YOUR PINKIE TO MEASURE TEN CENTIMETERS S
Line_4737	UP A PENCIL
Line_4738	HELLO UM I JUST LIKE STOPPED RIGHT THERE
Line_4739	THEY ARE THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE IT DEPENDS OFF ON HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4740	THEY WEIGH A DIFFERENT LIKE THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT SIZES YEAH
Line_4741	UM I I DON'T KNOW
Line_4742	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4743	ONES HEAVIER BECAUSE IF IT'S HEAVIER IT LEANS IF IT'S LIGHTER IT DOESN'T LEAN IT STICKS UP
Line_4744	UM NOT SURE
Line_4745	I'M NOT SURE
Line_4746	THAT ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER AND ONE OF THEM IS SMALLER
Line_4747	UM THERE IS TWENTY FIVE GRAM THERE IS TEN GRAM ER IS TWENTY GRAM I IS ONE GRAM
Line_4748	GOOD BYE I HAVE TO GO HI
Line_4749	I I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4750	A WHEAT
Line_4751	IT'S ABOUT LIKE TWENTY GRAMS AND YEAH JUST ABOUT GRAMS S
Line_4752	UM THE THE WASHER THE METAL CHIP AND THE WOOD CHIP
Line_4753	TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS WITH THE JECTUBJECT THAT YOU'RE RING IS S
Line_4754	NOT I NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4755	THAT UM
Line_4756	UM YOU WOULD
Line_4757	EAR'S NOT ENOUGH GRAMS FOR FOR IT TO BE THE SAME MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_4758	I I THINK IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED
Line_4759	YOU WEIGH MASSES AND STUFF
Line_4760	THAT UHM I I DON'T KNOW
Line_4761	HI
Line_4762	H I DON'T KNOW NOT EXACTLY SURE
Line_4763	DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4764	IT'S SPONGES DRY WET AND SOAKED
Line_4765	S OK SPUNGE IS REALLY HEAVY
Line_4766	IT'S JUST A DRY SPUNGE IT'S TH DRY SPUNGE IN A CUP HEAVIER THAN NOTHING
Line_4767	IF YOU DON'T KNOW W OR IF YOU DO KNOW
Line_4768	THAT A WED SPUNGE IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN UH
Line_4769	UM IT'S IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER PUNCH IT'S HO HEAVIER
Line_4770	M IT WAS IT WAS
Line_4771	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER GAS USUAL
Line_4772	M EXACTLY SHARE
Line_4773	UM NOT SURE
Line_4774	BUT THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE OF THE-
Line_4775	THAT GOT SCRAPED A YESTERDAY
Line_4776	HELPS H
Line_4777	THERE ARE
Line_4778	THE WATER AND THE CUP WELL THE VOLUME THE VOLUME IN THE CUP
Line_4779	POURING IT INTO A DIFFERENT CUP LIKE DROP LITTLE DROPS
Line_4780	YEATHE'RE ABOUT
Line_4781	IT'S TALKING ABOUT THEM JUST MILLIMETER LILLAMMILLMETERS MILLILITERS
Line_4782	TEN TEN MAKE A LITER
Line_4783	THE SAYING HOW MUCH MILLILITERS YOU UP WATER AND YOUR CUP
Line_4784	UM I'M M
Line_4785	A LEADER OR NO WE UH A RULER IS A
Line_4786	IT'S A SERRINGE WITH WATER IN IT AND IT'S GET A SQUEEZED OUT WATER
Line_4787	WE JUST YOU WOULD LOOK AT THIS RANGE BECAUSE IT SHOWS ON THE CRENGE
Line_4788	IT REPRESENTS THE MILLIMETERS THAT'S ON THE CRINGE
Line_4789	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETERS AND LITERS AND SYRINGE AND LIKE GRADUATED SILINDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4790	UM IT WAS LIT I CAN REMEMBER
Line_4791	THAT IT ENDED UP BEING A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4792	IT SHOWS HOW MUCH MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE MY GUESSES
Line_4793	A GRADUATED ILINDER
Line_4794	YOU MEASURE WAIT WELL YOU MEASURE MILLILITERS IN
Line_4795	UM NOT SURE
Line_4796	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT
Line_4797	JUST BY LOOKING AT IT AND FIGURING OUT T
Line_4798	YOU COULD JUST RIGHT THAT AB E D ON A CUP AND A I AM NOT SURE
Line_4799	THAT THE FIRST CUP A THE FIRST CUP IS BIGGER HAS MORE WATER THAN THE SECOND CUP
Line_4800	THAT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH A CAPACITY YOU HAVE
Line_4801	JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUIDS
Line_4802	UM MMM HMM WATERS
Line_4803	UM I THINK IT KEEPS FUEL
Line_4804	THAT THEY WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT ALIKE KINDS OF VOLUME MEASUREMENT
Line_4805	THAT IT'S FATTER BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME MASS OF VOLUME OR YEAH VOLUME
Line_4806	THAT IF IT'S HIT OR COLD BECAUSE YEAH IT'S UTTER COLD
Line_4807	WHICH ONE IS THE HOTTEST OR WHICH ONES IS THE COLDEST OR ONE OF THOSE
Line_4808	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_4809	YOU FEEL DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF SOULCIIGT AND FAIR NIGHT SOULCIIS AND FAIRNIGHT
Line_4810	I THINK IT'S A THERMAROMETER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME Y THICK
Line_4811	UM LIKE I ROUGHT DOWN TWENTY
Line_4812	THINK NOTHING REALLY THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A THING
Line_4813	IT'S ABOUT HOT NOT COLD I THINK I SURE
Line_4814	GETTING THE ANSWER OF SAULCIIS
Line_4815	BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF TOOL YOU USED AND THE UNIT TEMPERATURE
Line_4816	THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THE SAME
Line_4817	IT TURNS IN TO FARRON HEIGHT
Line_4818	THAT THE FIRST ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A HUNDRED SOLCIES AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIFTY FIVE SOL
Line_4819	THAT THE SECOND ONE IS A LOT COLDER THAN THE FIRST ONE
Line_4820	THAT IT'S LIKES COUNTING BY TENS LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY
Line_4821	UM F THE THERMOMETER GOES DOWN I GUESS
Line_4822	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER MAYBE
Line_4823	THAT IT GOES FROM UM FROM IT'S FROM FIVE TWO SIX TO NINE AND THEN TO THIRTEEN
Line_4824	THERE WAS A HUNDRED MINNETS A HUNDRED MINNETS I GUESS
Line_4825	THE INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER CHAIR THAT WE ACTUALLY USED TO RIGHT ON
Line_4826	TEMPERATURE AND PINTS THAT IT IS FROM
Line_4827	THE TEMP THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN AND CHANGED TO DEGREES SOLCISE
Line_4828	YOU COULD ESTIMATE OR STICK YOUR FINGER HAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4829	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER AND I GUESS WELL YOU WELL JUST YEAH BY JUST BY LOOKING AT IT
Line_4830	IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE THERMOMETER OR THE NUMBER LINES
Line_4831	THAT IT TURNS COLD TO IT TURNS PRETTY COLD AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE GREEN SO ICED
Line_4832	THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE Y YEAH
Line_4833	A THE THERMOMETER TELLS YOU H A TEMPERATURE CHANGED
Line_4834	ING A BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER
Line_4835	THAT IT'S DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND EACH ONE
Line_4836	UM THE WATER IS GETTING HOTTER AND COLDER
Line_4837	ECREADY
Line_4838	AM DOING A ROSE AND MY MATH
Line_4839	DON'T KNOW
Line_4840	THES VOLUME OR HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_4841	IT'S A HOW UM LONG IT IS FROM LIKE THE FRONT TO THE BACK
Line_4842	IT TELLS ME HOW UM LONG IT IS ACROSS
Line_4843	OF THE THE LENGTH OF THE DISK
Line_4844	I WAS THE STRAW AND MEASURING TAPE
Line_4845	MEASURING HOW UM LONG UHM
Line_4846	SOME WERE SMALLER AND SOME WERE LARGER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND UH
Line_4847	I DON'T KNOW ANY THINGS ABOUT IT
Line_4848	SUMMER SOMMER SHORTER AND UM GROUP A IS UM LONGER THAN GROUP B BECAUSE UM
Line_4849	IT MEANS THAT IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT THEN WHAT YOU I THINK
Line_4850	THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME HAND AND EACH GROUP
Line_4851	UM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE UM THE SAME THING ON EACH GROUPS
Line_4852	I UM GOT SOME WATER INSIDE THE SYRINGE AND THEN I UM A PUSHED IT OUT INTO THE CUP
Line_4853	I CAN USE THE
Line_4854	THE CAPACITY IS UH A HUNDRED
Line_4855	THERE IS A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4856	THEY ALL MEASURE UH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4857	IT'S TO MILLILITERS UH WATER
Line_4858	THEY'RE BOTH JUST THEY'RE BOTH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_4859	THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH THE UM CUP CAN HOLD
Line_4860	IT'S HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL
Line_4861	WE UH MEASURED
Line_4862	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITIALS IN CAPACITY
Line_4863	ITS SAID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_4864	IT IT'S UM THREE HUNDRED NO METERS THIS VOLUME POLE GOOD
Line_4865	IT TELLS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILL
Line_4866	-EY'RE ALL VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT
Line_4867	S LABELED WITH UM TEN MILLOLITERS BY UM EACH FOR EACH LINE
Line_4868	I WOULD USE THE CAPACITY IN MILLILITERS
Line_4869	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T I
Line_4870	I UH WENT
Line_4871	BA WAS COLDEST A WAS UM A LITTLE MORE MER AND SEE WAS ARE MESSED
Line_4872	WERE UM CUP IS HOTTEST AND WHICH CUP IS COLDEST
Line_4873	UM A IS THE SAME AS SE AND UM B IS ZEROAWBGREES CEL YE
Line_4874	IT'S HOW HOT OR CLEAR SOMETHIN
Line_4875	IT'S A THERMOMETER AND UM IT CAN UH FEEL HOW UM HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4876	M MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD SOME LIQUIDS ARE
Line_4877	THIS THERMOMETER IS MORE ACCURATE
Line_4878	GETS DEGREES CEL C I'S
Line_4879	CELL SEE UM FAIR IN HEIGHT
Line_4880	THE MIDDLE OF FIFTY DEGREES CELLCYIS IS TEN AND TEN DEGREES CELLCYIS IS THIRTY DEGREES CELLCYIS
Line_4881	U
Line_4882	IT UHM IT DROPS THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4883	I SAW THAT IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER THAN UM EVERY MINUTE IT WAS UM MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_4884	IT HAPPENED EVERY ONE MINUTE
Line_4885	IT WAS UM TWENTY DEGREES TO FIVE DEGREES
Line_4886	IT JUST STAYED ON THE BREED BUT IT NEVER WENT UP
Line_4887	THE TEMPERATURE AND UM THE TIME A MINUS
Line_4888	M THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4889	IT'S A GETTING MUCH BIGGER
Line_4890	IT DROP UH FIFTEEN DEGREES
Line_4891	COUNTING THE LINES ON THE WAX
Line_4892	WELL IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET WATER OUT OF A CAPICSULS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH PORT
Line_4893	WELL IT GOES TEN MIL MILLILITERS TWENTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLILITERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS S
Line_4894	WELL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS TOOL BUT MY GUESS IS TOO
Line_4895	GOING IT TO THE UM BY FILLING IT TO THIRTY
Line_4896	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I NOTICE T MORNING
Line_4897	UH MONEY SIR I SAI TO YOU I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS I KNOW I NEED TO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4898	I DO GO MARNIE CUMPROLUNCH GA BYE
Line_4899	IT'S HOW MUCH WATER A A CUP OR SOMETHING CAN HOLD
Line_4900	THAT THERE IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS FOR THE CAPACITY
Line_4901	I MARNEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_4902	UM AND SO ARE YOU ASKING WHAT DID I DO WELL WHICH IS MY GROUP TO OR WHAT TO DO
Line_4903	THAT TELLS HOW MUCH- HOW TALL THE CAN IS UM YEAH
Line_4904	UM WELL
Line_4905	OKA HA MARNIE I HAVE TO GO NOW CA
Line_4906	AND SO AFTER WE STUCK OUR FINGERS IN THE SAND THE WATER OF THE CUPS RE
Line_4907	WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS
Line_4908	I KNOW THAT'S LIKE HOW HOT OR HOW COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4909	WE PUT IN THERMOMETERS UM SO WE PUT INTO THE THERMOMETERS AND
Line_4910	I CAN'T TELL WHAT THE THE UH B IS BUT
Line_4911	UM THAT SEE MEANS SLCRIS
Line_4912	WELL UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4913	WELL I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SO REALLY MEANS EX WE'VE JUST STARTED OUR TEMPERATURE UNIT SO
Line_4914	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW LURNEY
Line_4915	UM YOU'VE DONE
Line_4916	LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE TO SAY FIVE DEGREES EH BUT YOU LOOK AT THE RED STUFF THAT GOES UP
Line_4917	UM WELL THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE RIGHT ARE HIKER THAN THE ONES ON THE LEFT
Line_4918	OH DON'T LIGHT COULD SEE EM GOOD
Line_4919	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURE
Line_4920	THE ICE MADE THE WATER COLD
Line_4921	IN SAID WE PUT THE ICE CUBES IN THAT MADE THE WATER MUCH MORE COLDER THAN IT WAS
Line_4922	AH FIVE DEGREES CALCIUS
Line_4923	AH UM AND SO THEY CAN GET SUPER COLD AND TURN TO ICE U
Line_4924	UH AND SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL TEMPERATURE VERY WELL
Line_4925	AND SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN MAYBE A PENNY PENCIL AND THEN YOU CAN RIGHT YOUR RESULTS ON THE PAPER
Line_4926	WELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID MARNEY UM I
Line_4927	MMM WE DIDN'T REALLIED DRAW OR DAD BUT WHEN ROTARDADA
Line_4928	I DON'T ONLY KNOW WHAT ABOUT GRAMS MARNIE
Line_4929	WE I PUT LIKE UM
Line_4930	THO WITH A MINE THAT IT TOOK EVERY TIME WE MEASURED
Line_4931	IT'S BECAUSE THEY MEASURED IT LIVE TIMES AND THEN THE TEN TRI TEMPERATURE CUP CHANGING A LITTLE
Line_4932	I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARNI
Line_4933	WE OBSERVED CHANGES MAYBE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES
Line_4934	I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOTS MONEY
Line_4935	WELL I CAN ONLY REMEMBER WHAT I ROAST DOWN MARNEY
Line_4936	I THINK IT WAS LIKE MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES CALCIUM
Line_4937	MONEY M THE SAY GOD BYE NO BYE BYE
Line_4938	HOLE MIND IT THAT'S CAN JOE WHAT'S YOURS CREVERUP GIVE HOPE THE LEA
Line_4939	YES I DO SEE THE PAPERS BELOW YOUR HEAD
Line_4940	UM E IT'S ON
Line_4941	NO YOU DID NOT REPEL YOURSELF
Line_4942	YES I I DO GET THAT
Line_4943	UM WELL WE JUST STARTED IN NO UNIT ABOUT MEASURING THE MECTRICSISTOM AND BEFORE THAT WE WERE DOING JEOMETRY
Line_4944	I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LENGTH IS ALL ABOUT T
Line_4945	THEY WERE A DIFFERENT SIZE SIZES A SHOW EVERY ONE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_4946	I UH I'M NOT EXACTLY SO WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_4947	I AM GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU SKING
Line_4948	UM THE SLOW UP TO DORNAB
Line_4949	THEY ARE ALL THE ELECTRIC THEY ALL UNIT TO THE METRIC SYSTEM
Line_4950	EVERY M PLACES OF THE UNITED STATES USES THE METRIC SYSTEM TO MEASURE STUFFS
Line_4951	UM I DO NOT KNOW W I
Line_4952	WHAT YOU COULD ESTIMATE ESTIMATE WHAT IS BASICALLY LIKE A MAKE OUR VALLMAT GUESS
Line_4953	UM I IT'S TEN INCHES
Line_4954	SOL CEN- SOL INCHES WIDE AND TWENTY INCHES UM TALL
Line_4955	THE M INTROIS
Line_4956	UM I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4957	UM TO MAKE WELL I GOT THE LIGHT AND SOL
Line_4958	T BETTER GET THAT BETTER WHATEVER'S PATH TO SINK YEAH
Line_4959	BECAUSE YOU KEEP BEEN DOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YOU GET BEEN BETTER EACH TIME
Line_4960	UM SO YOU I'M SACLIS SO
Line_4961	GOOD MORNING THINK YOU'RE FOR ASKING
Line_4962	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_4963	ASICAL THAT IS A QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_4964	MAKE WE MEASURED IT MORE THAN ONCE AS UM IT WON'T MAKE SHALL THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT AND SAL
Line_4965	YOUR PINK THE PINK THE POS IRON'S PINKIE IS ONE STONE METAL
Line_4966	IT IS ONE SAID THI METER WIDE
Line_4967	YOU DON'T KNOW
Line_4968	I I AM NOT SO
Line_4969	THEY ARE BOTH THE SAME LIGHTEST
Line_4970	THEY ARE UM MOST THE SAME ONE'S
Line_4971	UM SOME OF THEM ARE THE SAME AS
Line_4972	IT MEANT ALWAYS
Line_4973	THEY HAVE CEMETELES ON THE UM
Line_4974	DO I TO MA NO
Line_4975	I I AM GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4976	SO AND THEN EVERYONE GOT CLOSE AROUND CLOSER TO THE SAME ANFUL AROUND THE SAME NUMBER
Line_4977	THOSE THAT ARE MADE OUT DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_4978	WHAT THEY WERE MADE OF MAYBE
Line_4979	YOU WANT TO SEE HOW M WITH ONE'S HEAVER
Line_4980	I DON'T LAW LIE KNOW
Line_4981	YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE CLIPS THE PLASTIC TRIP IS
Line_4982	YOU ARE USING UM UH
Line_4983	DON'T KNOW
Line_4984	THAT'S UTRITHRICK DISC UM MA DISCSOD UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4985	UH WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND GRAMS
Line_4986	I DON'T KNOW ONE IS BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_4987	THEY WOULD BE DIFFERENT
Line_4988	EVERYONE WHO THEY GET A DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_4989	UM WELL OUT WELL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
Line_4990	T'S SELLING A CLOUB AND IT'S SAYING IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_4991	I'M NOT UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4992	BYE TO BYE BY
Line_4993	THAT RICH CISTOM UNITS
Line_4994	UM YOU'RE MEASURING WHAT THE THING WE'LL BOB TO HOW MUCH IT WEAVED
Line_4995	MEASURING SOMETHING I
Line_4996	THAT WEIGHTS DON'T GET IT GRAMS CAN I PLEASE DON'T KNOW
Line_4997	I I DON'T KNEW
Line_4998	SOLANDERS TO HEAVI
Line_4999	HON'T KNOW
Line_5000	IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAMS

Line_5009	THEM TO WILL NOT KNOW
Line_5010	MOE ON
Line_5011	A POLE POLE HOT THIN
Line_5012	HE WOULD KNOW OH
Line_5013	WHAT'S ILITO BELL
Line_5014	UM WE DO NOT DO THE MEASUREMENT ONE'S ONE THOUSAND WHAT OF A L
Line_5015	UH WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_5016	I HAD NEVER ACTUALLY USED A OIL STEEL
Line_5017	HOW ER DON'T KNOW KNOW B
Line_5018	UHM WE'RE TOLD WHICH AGAIN
Line_5019	UM THEN SOME MONEY HAD SO DID I CHOSE
Line_5020	UM UH WHAT DID YOU SAY
Line_5021	I DIDN'T HEAR YOU I DON'T HERE I
Line_5022	AN N BULL IS SAYING HOW MANY MILLI LEADERS IT IS
Line_5023	UM POLEIRTY
Line_5024	UM WE'RE STING TO FREE AT HOW MUCH WATER WE'VE FIND THE GAP
Line_5025	I I DON'T ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5026	UM LIKE CAN A MUMBOWHOULD BE SO L
Line_5027	M UH I FORGET WITH THOSE THINGS GO
Line_5028	WELL WE NE GO OUT AND THE CUP WE GO DID A INTO THE CUP
Line_5029	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY MIDDLE LIKE COLS ON THERE
Line_5030	FIFTY MILLA LEADS
Line_5031	IT IT IT'S A HUNDRED NILLALITALS IT'S VOLUME IT'S ONE HUNDRED MILLA LITERS
Line_5032	IT TELLS YOU IT'S BACLY LIKE THE CRANE IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IS IN IT
Line_5033	UM YOUR MEASURE STUFF UM YOU LIE IN STUFF DU
Line_5034	UM OUT NOW WH UH THE WEANS IN
Line_5035	OUT LOW CAPACITY IS
Line_5036	UM THEY HAVE LETTERS ON THEM MADE TO BE
Line_5037	UM KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5038	I STILL UNDERSTANDS CAPACITY IS
Line_5039	DON'T KNOW
Line_5040	UM UM I DON'T REALLY HEAR YOU
Line_5041	UM BUT THE DON'T SNOW
Line_5042	IT WHERE IS TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WAT AL
Line_5043	UM IT'S TWO HADRIMOMET IS THE WATER
Line_5044	UH WE'VE BEEN
Line_5045	I UH NOT NO
Line_5046	I F THAT'S THE UP LIGHT TO THE TOP
Line_5047	PLLBLA THAT'S WHAT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S SISLING THAT'S HOW YOU'RE COME TO ME
Line_5048	IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS INSIDE OF IT T
Line_5049	THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MEAN AND EL LITER IT'S IN SIDE THE SODA IS THE MA SODA INSIDE
Line_5050	WHAT DID YOU THINK
Line_5051	UM TO THAT WAS JUST IT WAS TELLING YOU THE VOLUME OF THE CAN
Line_5052	THREE HUNDRED TALL UP
Line_5053	UM I NOTICE THAT'S NOT THE WAY FILL TO TOP SO
Line_5054	THE THERE IS A SOLENCH A GRADUAL LIT IT A GRADUATED CELANDAL AND A LITAL
Line_5055	UM I YOU THINK OUT HOW MUCH HOW MUCH LIQUID AND SO IT SOMETIMES
Line_5056	WHAT DID YOU NAIL
Line_5057	UM I OUT IT' S
Line_5058	UM OUT WELL DO ONE NOW
Line_5059	UM THEY A THE LAST FOR THEM IS TIED UP
Line_5060	UM OR NO
Line_5061	HI MY NAME IS NICKLIE AND I'M NINE
Line_5062	MEASURING IS ABOUT UM LIKE MEASURING TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT MEASURING IS ABOUT
Line_5063	IT WOULD BE TRYING TO PICK IT OUT HOW LONG THAT IS THE THING YOU ASK ME TO MEASURE IS
Line_5064	I USED A STRAW AND THEN I USED UM A MEASURING TAPE WITH UH CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5065	YOU GOT MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWERS SO IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD UM STRATEGY TO USE RES
Line_5066	I HOW ARE YOU I'M VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_5067	MONTH WE'VE BEEN DOING MABLACATION AND DIVESION
Line_5068	UM YOU MEASURED STUFF WITH METERS AND BET THAT'S BASICALLY ALL OF IT LIKE YOU JUST MEASURE STUFF
Line_5069	UM BECAUSE IF YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER
Line_5070	UM M THE HEIGHT OF MY DESK
Line_5071	UM FROM THE GRAND TO THE IN
Line_5072	THEY ALL HAVE M CENTIMETERS IN IT
Line_5073	UM BECAUSE LIKE M AND LIKE I I FORGET
Line_5074	YOU WOULD A ESTIMATE BECAUSE YOU WOULD ESTIMATE
Line_5075	UH ESTIMATING IS AN EDUCATED GUESS
Line_5076	IT IS A THREE UNITS
Line_5077	I FORGET
Line_5078	OK CAN KEEP PRACTICING AND THEN YOUR ESTIMATES WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER
Line_5079	YOU WOULD GET BETTER BECAUSE YOU WOULD JUST KEEP PRACTICING AND YOU WILL GET MORE USED TO IT
Line_5080	YOU USE RULER OR A METER STICK OR LIKE A SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_5081	YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS
Line_5082	LIKE IT WOULD JUST GO THAT IT WOULD BE VERY RINCALLY SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY GET QUITE PERCISE ANSWER
Line_5083	TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOUR GOT IT RIGHT
Line_5084	I FORGET I THINK
Line_5085	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5086	YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT T
Line_5087	THE PERSON IS MEASURING A S PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5088	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5089	UM IT'S A I FEEL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5090	I MEASURED FROM MY RISK TO MY ELBOW
Line_5091	HE MY ARM SPAN AND MY HEIGHT
Line_5092	I SEE THAT HER NOSE ON HER EAR IS THE SAME LENGTH
Line_5093	AND GENERAL H USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_5094	YOU WOULD YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU COULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5095	U USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5096	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5097	THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER AND THEN IT GOES TO A DECIMETER THEN A CENTIMETER AND THEN A ME MILLIMETER
Line_5098	YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A A CENTIMETER
Line_5099	I DON'T N'T KNOW
Line_5100	YOU INDIAN TELL
Line_5101	I THINK IT'S THE MATERIALS THAT MAKES SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
Line_5102	IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT H SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5103	T WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5104	HI DON'T KNOW
Line_5105	I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5106	YOU I DON'T KNOW I THIN
Line_5107	IT OR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5108	UM YOU ARE USING A SHELF TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5109	BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_5110	I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIP WEIGHED ONE GRAM
Line_5111	WE USED PAPER CLIPS
Line_5112	THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACTUALLY TO FIGURE AT THE REAL ANSWER
Line_5113	THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLER IS OF A CUP THAT IS ONE GRAM
Line_5114	YOU COULD MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THINGS
Line_5115	AM IT WAS ONE GRAM
Line_5116	IT WAS A GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISC WAS GRAMS
Line_5117	THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHTY GRAMS
Line_5118	IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5119	GRAMS ARE THE METRIC SISTIM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK
Line_5120	YOU CAN I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5121	YOU UM SO YOU HIVE CAN TELL ANYMORE IT TEND TO CET- IT UP
Line_5122	SO UM YOU I DON'T KNOW
Line_5123	IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5124	THE CAR AND THE PICTURE WEIGHS SEVEN GRAMS
Line_5125	YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
Line_5126	I FLICKERED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5127	A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOME THING'S LESS THAN A GRAM
Line_5128	ONE E THOUSAND
Line_5129	I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5130	OH WOULD USE IT WHEN THERE LIKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND
Line_5131	YOU WOULD GET A REALLY ACCURATE UH ANSWER
Line_5132	I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT IN A DRY SPONGE AND WATER THAT IT WILL ESOBSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER
Line_5133	U SILK SPONGES UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5134	THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SUSPENDS
Line_5135	ITS WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATERY
Line_5136	WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE ON A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE ON ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_5137	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE
Line_5138	I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUAL A THREE GRAMS
Line_5139	YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU GOOD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITH OUT THE SPENTIN IT
Line_5140	I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND UH HE HOT IT WAS THREE GRAM
Line_5141	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET S SPENCH WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5142	UM THE I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5143	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WAITED
Line_5144	I FORGET AND I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5145	YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MAG ER THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
Line_5146	YOU USED GRAMS
Line_5147	YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD YOU TAKE A D
Line_5148	I WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS
Line_5149	YOU CAN USE A VIAL
Line_5150	I NOTICE THAT THE FIRST FILE IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND FIL
Line_5151	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ELECTRIC UNITS ARE FROM MEASURING VOLUME
Line_5152	IT'S UM LEADER
Line_5153	A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AND TO A MILLILITERS
Line_5154	MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER
Line_5155	I I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS ON THEM
Line_5156	HERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND A LITER
Line_5157	ARE ONE TH CENT ONE THOUSAND MINELALEATERS AND A LEADER
Line_5158	TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LITER
Line_5159	THE PLASTIC CUP W
Line_5160	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5161	UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5162	IT'S A CORN WITH UMWATER IN IT
Line_5163	IT MAKES THEM GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN SUCK UP A PERVERY PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5164	UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY APPRESENT
Line_5165	WE FIGURED OUT THE VOLUME BY USING A CURRENT AND A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5166	THAT OBJECT IS A SURREANGE AND IT HAS SHORT MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5167	THAT TOOL IS A GRADUATED ILINDER
Line_5168	I NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS ITS CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5169	YOU MEASURED SOMETHING THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER B YEAH
Line_5170	CAPACITY IS THE AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPPY LIP TOP LIKE YEAH
Line_5171	I NOTICED THAT UM AT THE CUP CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT
Line_5172	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5173	IT'S WHEN YOU IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE WATER
Line_5174	THEY ARE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLITER VESSELS
Line_5175	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5176	I OBSERVED THAT THE TALL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLOLITERS OF WATER
Line_5177	I LEARN THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5178	IM WELL
Line_5179	AND MATH WE SAW WE TRIED TO SEE IF
Line_5180	I OBSERVED THAT IT'S IT'S CAPACITY AND IT'S CAPACITY IS THREE HUN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5181	YOU COULD USE WATER TO HELP FIGURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5182	I NOTICED THAT THE LIQUID IS AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5183	H PRINTED NUMBER TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN
Line_5184	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5185	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5186	THAT IS THE CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5187	IT STANDS FOR THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5188	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5189	I OBSERVED THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_5190	THERE IS A SCREEN A GRADUATED CILLANDER AND A LEATER LEATER LIKE CUP THING
Line_5191	Y YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH UM LIQUID IS IN SOMETHING
Line_5192	WE USE THE METRIC CISTOM USES MILLILITERS AND RIGHT NOW IN SCHOOL WE ONLY USED MILLI LITERS
Line_5193	I YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED
Line_5194	IT IS DOING A MATH QUASION TO GET YOU TO YOUR ANSWER
Line_5195	SO THAT YOU CAN ENO YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5196	I DISCOVERED ER THAT IT WAS I SEEN DON'T REALLY DISCOVER ANYTHING
Line_5197	YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CAP A CA ER CA C WATER WAS WARMER
Line_5198	YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER
Line_5199	I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS CLOSEST AND WHICH ONE IS S AND BETWEEN
Line_5200	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5201	IT THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
Line_5202	WE PUT A SUMMMITER AND
Line_5203	YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHINGS
Line_5204	IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH
Line_5205	US SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES
Line_5206	YOU YOU WE'RE USING CELCIES AND THIS UNIT
Line_5207	IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GONE DOWN AND WHEN IT GOES DOWN
Line_5208	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5209	I DO MA KNOWS THAT
Line_5210	M I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5211	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_5212	WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGERS
Line_5213	WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE AND THE WATER W
Line_5214	UHM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY
Line_5215	UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT ONCE IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH
Line_5216	I DISCOVERIED THAT IT GOT MUCH COLDER
Line_5217	IT DROPS SLOWER
Line_5218	IT DROP FIFTEEN SELCILIS
Line_5219	THEY CAN FREEZE
Line_5220	IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S KIND LIKE CONTRACTING AND SO YEAH
Line_5221	YOU CAN RIGHTS IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND IT
Line_5222	WE JUST PLAIN IT I RIGTING IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5223	DO UM MY DOT AND NUMBERS ON A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
Line_5224	I NOTICED THAT IN TEN MINUTES IT DROPPED DOWN TO FIVE DEGREES AND THEN IN
Line_5225	I THE PARTS OF THE GRAPH I DON'T KNOW THAT T
Line_5226	GRASS ARE TO HELP YOU LIKE MEASURE AND KEEPS TRACKING YOUR STUFF
Line_5227	PUT NUMBERS ON THE SIDE
Line_5228	IT HELPS YOU KEEP TRACK OF LE TEN MINTS AS FIVE DEGREES TWENTY MINUTES IT'S THIRTY DEGREES LIKE THAT
Line_5229	YOU CAN USE IT TO YE T I DON'T KNOW
Line_5230	I PUT LIKE HOW IT DROPPED IN HOW I HOW IT DROPPED IN TEMPERATURE AND HOW IT RUNS UP IN TEMPERATURE
Line_5231	THEY HELP YOU THEY'RE ARE ALIKE ABOUT
Line_5232	IT RUNS DOWN REALLY FAR NU IT'S GOING UP
Line_5233	IT HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW HOW IT RISES IN TIME AND THEN HOW IT DROPS IN TIME
Line_5234	FOR TEN MINUTES
Line_5235	IT GOES UP AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5236	IT'S HITTING COLDER AND WARMER
Line_5237	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5238	AND THEN YOU WOULD THEM TOGETHER AND GET YOUR ANSWER OF HOW UH DIFFERENT IT WAS
Line_5239	YOU CAN COUNT THE TEGREE CELCES IT DROP
Line_5240	T WHEN IT EITHER GOES DOWN UM THE RED STUFF GOES DOWN ON A CUMP THERMOMETER OR UP
Line_5241	UM S THE TEMPERATURE IS CHANGING
Line_5242	HI MY NAME IS STOVE
Line_5243	YES I DON
Line_5244	I I PRESSED THE REPEAT BUTTON
Line_5245	YES IT DIES
Line_5246	M MEASURING IS WHEN WELL
Line_5247	MEASURING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE HOW LONG SOMETHING IS FOR
Line_5248	IT WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_5249	LENGTH IS BORED
Line_5250	ARNIE I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE
Line_5251	ONE IS LONGER THAN THE OTHER BUT I HAVE TO GO RIGHT TOW
Line_5252	IN MATH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND WE ARE DOING A LOT OF FUNNY STUFF AND MATH
Line_5253	UH IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR TO THE DOOR KNOB
Line_5254	THEY'RE ALL FROM THE METRIC CISTIM
Line_5255	YOU CAN ESTIMATE
Line_5256	WELL SOMETIMES ESTIMATING IS JUST YEAST
Line_5257	YOU CAN TELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5258	GUESSING HOW LONG WIDE OR THICK SOMETHING IS OR HOW TALL IT IS
Line_5259	ACTUALLY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5260	YOU CAN USE A MEASURED TAPE OR A RULER OR A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK OR A FEET OR INCHES
Line_5261	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5262	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BUT
Line_5263	SO YOU CAN JUST DOUBLE CHACK TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT
Line_5264	IT WAS A VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND EASY
Line_5265	AN AN A WET
Line_5266	WELL UM SOMETIMES IT'S HARD SOMETIMES YOU NEED A FRIENDS TO HELP YOU BUT
Line_5267	FOR THAT IT USED A MEASURING TAPE SO IT WAS EASIER THAN USING A METER STICK
Line_5268	THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG
Line_5269	T'S ONE CENTIMETER LONG SO IF YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS LIKE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5270	YESTERDAY WE MEASURED WHICH ONE WAS THE HEAVIEST IN WHICH ONE IS THE LIGHTEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5271	THE THEM THE METAL DISC IS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5272	PLASTIC SHOULD BE LIGHTER THAN A METAL
Line_5273	YOU COULD MEASURE INSTEAD OF ESTIMATING
Line_5274	THE BALANCED AND MAYBE MY HAND
Line_5275	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5276	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_5277	IT SAYS THAT SOMETHING EQUALS ONE GROUPS
Line_5278	I A DON'T KNOW
Line_5279	THAT THE THAT THE STUFF WE U THE MATERIALS THAT WE USED WERE HEAVIER
Line_5280	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANY MEASUREMENT ON MASS
Line_5281	WE'VE BEEN USING THE METRIC CISTIM
Line_5282	THE LITTLE PIECES OF WOOD ON THE RIGHT CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5283	TELLS ME THAT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5284	WELL IF YOU PUT LET'S SAY
Line_5285	TWO GRAMS
Line_5286	YOU CAN ESTIMATE HOW TALL OR HOW MUCH THEY WEY
Line_5287	WHAT A REFERENCE IS A YET
Line_5288	THEY'RE REFERENCES I'M GUESSING
Line_5289	TO BE MEASURED COMPLETELY STRAIGHT
Line_5290	YOU NEED SEVENTY GRAMS TO MEASURE THIS CAR TO MAKE IT A COMPLETELY MEASURED
Line_5291	BECAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SMALL GRAM PIECES AND IT WON'T MEASUREMENT STRICTLY
Line_5292	MAYBE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW HOW HOW HEAVY IT IS FOR A RECIPE OR SOMETHING IN R CUP BOOK
Line_5293	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_5294	GET A ONE HUNDRED GRAM PIECE OR USE AT DIFFERENT THING THEN A BALANCE BEAM
Line_5295	TWO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS S
Line_5296	YOU E I DON'T KNOW
Line_5297	THE GRAVEL IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAMS S
Line_5298	SO THEY MEASURED EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5299	I I HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT KILOGRAMS YET
Line_5300	YOU USE IT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT'S THO HEAVY TO USE FOR GRAMS
Line_5301	HEAVIER THAN HEAVIER THAN A BLOCK
Line_5302	I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE MARNEY
Line_5303	IT'S GOING VERY WELL
Line_5304	WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING MUCH MEASUREMENT T BUT WE'VE BEEN BALANCING THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN USING A BALANCE
Line_5305	WELL IT'S DRY SO IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS A A SPONGE WITH THAT WAS WET SO IT'S PRETTY LIGHT
Line_5306	WHAT SPONGE IS A SPONGE WELL UHM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5307	WHEN IT IN TO PULL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP
Line_5308	YOU PUT IT ON A BALANCE AND THEN USE TO KEEP ON PUTTING WE
Line_5309	UM THE THE DRESS SPONGE IT EQUALS THREE GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S LEVELED OUT ON THE BALANCE
Line_5310	THE WET SPONGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE BECAUSE THE WET S SPUNGE HAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT
Line_5311	THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS S
Line_5312	THE WHITE SPONGE IS SIX TEN GRAMS
Line_5313	UM THE THE WEIGH SPONGE IS
Line_5314	THE SPONGE HELD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5315	ICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5316	RE GOOD I AM VERY VERY GOOD
Line_5317	WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH AN EMPTY CUP
Line_5318	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5319	UH THAT THAT THE CUP CAN HOLD THAT MANY VILE S OF WATER AND SIDE OF IT
Line_5320	YOU COULD USE VIALS B
Line_5321	F GROUP ONE IS BIGGER THAN GROUP TWO
Line_5322	IT WON'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS THAN OTHER PEOPLE
Line_5323	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT IN CLASS S SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5324	IT'S JUST MARKING THE SPOTS
Line_5325	E IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS FILLED UP AND THAT
Line_5326	HERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5327	W MUCH WATER THERE ISN'T A CUP OR HOW MUCH USE OR SOMETHING
Line_5328	E IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5329	YOU COULD USE THE CIRVENGE
Line_5330	IT SAYS LIKE EAT LITERS THIRTY EIGHT LITERS I MEAN MILLILITERS
Line_5331	UM WELL ACTUALLY YESTERDAY I WASN'T THERE FOR SINGS SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5332	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T HERE YESTERDAY AND SCIENCE
Line_5333	I DON'T KNOW HOW I FIGURED IT OUT VOLUME
Line_5334	WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT A SILANDER OR A SIRVANCE
Line_5335	I THINK IT'S CALLED A CORRANGE
Line_5336	I DIDN'T USE A STRANGE
Line_5337	I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A CRANGE CAN HOLD
Line_5338	I I DON'T KNOW I NEVER WORKED WITH THIS THE OTHER DAY SO
Line_5339	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT TALK
Line_5340	I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT
Line_5341	WE COULD MEASURE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER
Line_5342	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT I'M JUST GUESSING NOTHING
Line_5343	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5344	HAT'S TOO HARD I DON'T KNOW
Line_5345	ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
Line_5346	UHM THE SECOND CUP DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER AND IT AS THE FIRST CUP
Line_5347	DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5348	THE SODA INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN ONLY FILLS UP TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS A CAPACITY
Line_5349	YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA CAN IN IT SAYS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF SODA IS IT THERE
Line_5350	YOU I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT'S ONLY FILLED MOSTLY TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL THE WAY
Line_5351	THE PRINTED NUMBER IS TELLING YOU THAT THE AMOUNT OF SODA THAT IS IN THAT CAN IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5352	THERE IS A WELL THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF LIQUID INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5353	THE LIQUID OF THE VOLUME WAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5354	CAPACITY OF THE CAN IS THREE HUNDRED
Line_5355	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT OR THE SAME
Line_5356	THERE IS A SYRINGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THING IN THE MIDDLE IS BUT THE CUP IS ONE LITER
Line_5357	UM A THERE IS NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MAKES ONE LITER
Line_5358	I WOULD USE A SYRINGE E INSTEAD OF SOMETHING ELSE
Line_5359	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO THAT BUT MARNIE I'M GOING TO GO NOW BYE BYE
Line_5360	IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST AND WHICH ONE'S IN THE MIDDLE
Line_5361	UM ONE IS NORMAL OR HOTTER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_5362	TO SEE HOW HOT COLD OR WARM S SOMETHING IS
Line_5363	B CAUSE FINGERS DON'T WORK
Line_5364	IT MEASURES THE WEIGHT OR TEMPERATURE OR LENGTHS OF SOMETHING
Line_5365	I THINK THE UNITS CALLED SIS
Line_5366	I DON'T KNOW THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MAYBE LATER I I WILL
Line_5367	THAT IT'S NOT AS COLD SHOT I MEAN
Line_5368	HOT WATER IS WARMER THAN ICE WATER BECAUSE ICE IS IN THE WATER
Line_5369	AY SO IN THIS PICTURE YOU'RE POR AN
Line_5370	WELL YOU'RE POURING ICE WATER AND TO WARM WATER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO GET
Line_5371	I WOULD GET WARM AND COLD THE ICE WATER WOULD MAKE THE WARM WATER COLDER BUT THE WARM WATER WOULD MAKE THE ICE WATER WARMER
Line_5372	Y YOU COULD ESTIMATE
Line_5373	WELL I NEVER I FIGURED THAT OUT
Line_5374	IT'S DOING VERY GOOD
Line_5375	IT GETS HOLDERS
Line_5376	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER FEARONHEIGHTE OR SOLCIS
Line_5377	WELL WHEN I GET IT I USED A THERMOMETER I
Line_5378	T'S A LITTLE SQUARES IT'S GOT THE AREA AND THE UM
Line_5379	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YEAH H
Line_5380	I DON'T KNOW I
Line_5381	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT IS
Line_5382	T'S GOING DOWN OR UP
Line_5383	SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES FOR SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES
Line_5384	UM A COUPLE OF MINUTES
Line_5385	YOU COULD USE A THERAMOMETAL OR YOUR FINGER PIN YOUR FINGERS AREN'T THE BEST UM WEIGHT TWO BUT IT IS ONE WAY
Line_5386	TWO SALCIE'S STOWN
Line_5387	WE LOOKED T IT AND THEN WE RECORDED IT ON A PAPER
Line_5388	YOU COULD READ THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE THE MARKS BECAUSE THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5389	UM THE RED PART GOES DOWN OR UP BUT IF IT STAYS THEN IT'S NOT CHANGE IT
Line_5390	WHATEVER IS IN THE WATER THE MER MATERIALS ICE HOT WATER THAT MAKES IT CHANGES
Line_5391	STUDYING A MAGNETISM AND PLAYING WITH MAGNETS
Line_5392	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASS UM WE DID THIS EXACT SAME THING AND UH THAT HAPPENED
Line_5393	U WASHERS A D CELL AND RAT MENTAL ROT
Line_5394	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT WON'T LET THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH
Line_5395	WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH CIRCUITS WITH BATTERIES WIRES AND MOTORS R LIGHTS AND UH SWITCH
Line_5396	I PUT THE STRAW IN A ROUND PLACE BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS STRIP OF METAL
Line_5397	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5398	I ACTUALLY JUST REMEMBER THAT A ELIMINIUM DOES STICK BECAUSE IT IS METAL JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
Line_5399	NO NOT EXACTLY IT JUST KEEPS IT PEOPLE SAFE FROM ELECTRICUTING THEMSELVES OR BEING SHOCKED OR GETTING HURT
Line_5400	BRASS HOLE ON MEAN WASHER AND NOTHING ELSE
Line_5401	IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MAGNETS
Line_5402	WE'VE BEEN ELECTRICITY IN USING CIRCUITS AND THEN TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5403	THE BULBS ARE BOTH LAYING UP BUT IN OUR CLASS THE WE COULDN'T GET HIM TO
Line_5404	IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF NEGATIVE AND GOES IN TO POSITIVE AND SO IT TRAVELS THROUGH A AND SO YEAH
Line_5405	IT ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE END NOT BUT NEGATIVES AND THAT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SO YEAH
Line_5406	THE BATTERY ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW BACK INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE S
Line_5407	LEARNING ABOUT THE WATER CYCLES
Line_5408	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5409	THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THROUGH THE PLAIN OF WOOD
Line_5410	E HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_5411	I SEE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5412	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_5413	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP WHILE I THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT
Line_5414	THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PAT NO TWO THE TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
Line_5415	THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED
Line_5416	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON T INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5417	ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHTBULBS
Line_5418	I SEE ON THE LEFT THERE IS A NON FAIR WELL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE
Line_5419	THAT IF IT THROUGH A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE IN HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5420	THAT IT IS A MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5421	THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5422	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER
Line_5423	WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL AND ATTACH I TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5424	THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING YOU RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
Line_5425	POSCITATIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5426	WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AND HANDS ON THE NEGATIVES
Line_5427	THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING IN ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIRES ATTACHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT ITS NOT LIGHTING UP
Line_5428	I HAVE TO ATTACH ONE TO THE SITE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_5429	IT IS RIGHT AND RESTOF THEM ARE NOT
Line_5430	THE CAN THE CUNOSIT
Line_5431	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_5432	A NAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTACH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR ST
Line_5433	ALLY THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL
Line_5434	WELL THE MATERIALS THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAIN METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
Line_5435	THEY'RE COVERED WITH PLASTIC
Line_5436	I OF FEND DURING SHINING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS CAN STICK
Line_5437	UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU SLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRY TO PUSH THEM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES THUMB APART
Line_5438	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
Line_5439	THE MAGNETS FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
Line_5440	THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THE D
Line_5441	WELL THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES ONE STICK AND IF YOU MAKE PLA IT MOVES
Line_5442	MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5443	S IT CAN GO THROUGH OTHER MILLS
Line_5444	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5445	IRON IRON METAL OR STEEL
Line_5446	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5447	IT IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS FROM ONE BATTERY
Line_5448	WELL IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY IT WILL MATTER YOU
Line_5449	THAT ONE'S CAN IT STUFFS FOR ME
Line_5450	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5451	WELL IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE AND THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_5452	THAT'S GOING A TO ONE FOR ME
Line_5453	THAT'S AN A UFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5454	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLYING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5455	UH THAT'S ONE A TOP ONE FOR ME
Line_5456	WELL IT REPELS NEGATIVE END INTO THE POSITIVE END AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
Line_5457	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
Line_5458	DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNEY
Line_5459	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT MARNIE
Line_5460	WHAT THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5461	THAT THERE IS ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONE'S A SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5462	WELL PART OF IT WRONG I IT DOESN'T
Line_5463	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S IN SO YEAH
Line_5464	THE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJECTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
Line_5465	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING
Line_5466	ET ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_5467	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN D THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_5468	WELL FULL OF ELECTRICITY CANORTIC WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KIND OF CONNECT TO
Line_5469	THE RIVIC CAN STAN MAGNETIC OH FOR IT SOMETIME
Line_5470	WELL IN SCIENCE ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5471	ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5472	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETISM AND S THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5473	IT'S A MAGNET THAT ATTRACTS IT'S OPPOSITE AND IT DOES NOT ATTRACT IT'S SAT
Line_5474	IT ATTRACTS THINGS WELL
Line_5475	IT'S ATTRACTING THINGS THAT ARE STEEL OR UH IRON
Line_5476	UM IT DOESN'T DO ANY MA IT DOESN'T STICK TO ANY MATERIAL'S THAT AREN'T STEEL OR IRON
Line_5477	UM THERE IS IRON THERE STEEL THERE IS UM MOCK WOOD PLASTIC COPPER AND A SPONGE
Line_5478	UM WELL THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE UM SO UM MOSTLY METAL AND YEAH
Line_5479	I THINK THAT IRON AND STEEL IS A ROCK SO IT MAY HAVE A LITTLE CONTAINING IN THAT R
Line_5480	YOU ASKED ME THAT BUT UM IT IT STICKS TO IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY
Line_5481	UH MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL AND
Line_5482	UM THE THE STEEL NAIL UM STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT
Line_5483	AN ALUMINUM NAIL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_5484	UM THE ALUMINIUM NAIL UH DOES NOT HAVE THE MATERIAL IN IT THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL DOES
Line_5485	M I THINK THAT UM THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TOGETHER ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES AND THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER ARE
Line_5486	ORKING OUT MAGNETS AND WATER
Line_5487	UM THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS AND THE ONE SIDE THAT IT OVER POWERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5488	UM THE THE UM WASHERS HUH ARE THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS THAT IT OVER POURS ONCE
Line_5489	UM THEY THEY STILL HARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT
Line_5490	BLOCKS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5491	HERE STILL A BIT OF MAGNETIC FIELD THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS STRONG AS IT WAS WHEN I ONLY HAD LIKE A COUPLE SPACER S
Line_5492	UM IT'S CALLED MAGNETIC FIELDS AND IT IN OP OP IT ATTRACT AND UM THE SAME D CRADTRACTS
Line_5493	UM YOU READ ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_5494	TWO BULBS AND THE HAVE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH TWO CIRCUITS
Line_5495	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BRIGHTER AND ONE ON THE LEFT ISN'T BRIGHTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FORMATION
Line_5496	IT'S LIT A DIFFER
Line_5497	UM IT'S BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANOTHER ELECTRIC BULB
Line_5498	UM THERE'S THE ELECTRIC THEY'RE THE SIMPLE FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH THINGS
Line_5499	IT'S TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULB'S
Line_5500	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH BULB I
Line_5501	M IT GOES THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND IT JUST KEEPS GO TRAVELING A CIRCUIT FOR EACH SIDE
Line_5502	IF ON THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S EACH OWOLB HAS A SEPARATE THING
Line_5503	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH AND IT'S GOING THROUGH IT SEPARIT PATHWAY
Line_5504	PROBABLY PARALLELS
Line_5505	LECTRICITY IS RESEMBLED BY BLUE TRAVELLING DOTS
Line_5506	M I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5507	UM DO YOU MEAN STRING OF CRISMES IS
Line_5508	UM THERE IS WASHERS THERE'S A D CELL BATTERY THERE'S A WIRE A SWITCH A HOLDER AND THE STEEL ROD
Line_5509	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TO AND IT ATTRACTS THINGS IF IT'S A MAGNET

Line_5517	UM THE BATTERY IS MAKING ELECTRICITY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5518	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ALL THE WAY SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN MAKES A FULL CIRCUIT AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5519	IT'S THE I IT IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WHICH PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5520	UM WELL BASICALLY UNTIL THE BATTERY LUNG RUNS OUT OR THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF
Line_5521	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL IN A FULL CIRCUITS
Line_5522	UM UH I'VE SEEN PAPER CLIPS HE TEMPERMARY MAGNETS YEAH
Line_5523	SULATER BYE

Line_5564	IT'S A SCIMATIC AND IT SHOWS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE UM BATTERY
Line_5565	IT'S UH IT CERMBULES A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY
Line_5566	A A SWITCH A BATTERY AND A MOTOR
Line_5567	WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF A MAGNETS
Line_5568	IT HAS TO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LEAD THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5569	THE MAGNETS THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP
Line_5570	WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH
Line_5571	THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THING S
Line_5572	WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM U
Line_5573	IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THEN YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHERS PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT
Line_5574	YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5575	YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FUN ESPECIALLY THE ME ONES
Line_5576	THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHTBULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5577	UM THERE ARE TWO
Line_5578	BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BURN BRIGHTER
Line_5579	THEN ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD
Line_5580	TODAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK
Line_5581	TO DAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A A BATTERY
Line_5582	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS SORT OF SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_5583	ONE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ANOTHER IS AN PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5584	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS
Line_5585	UM IT HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5586	UM THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT
Line_5587	IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT UM THEN UM NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_5588	WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN I CLICKED ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T BURN OUT
Line_5589	UP BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH VERY MUCH CONNECTED TO THE UM D CELL
Line_5590	PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF ONE BULB LIGHTS OUT BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_5591	THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT AS WELL AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5592	UM WAIT ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5593	UH THE WAS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT
Line_5594	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5595	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING AROUND OR ELSE THE ENERGY WON'T REACH THE MAGNETS SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_5596	IF YOU TURN IT IF YOU CLOSE THE SWITCH THEN IT'S SORT OF TURNS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON SORT LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_5597	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT IN A SORT OF IN A CIRCLE OR ELSE THE IT WON'T FLOW CORRECTLY
Line_5598	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5599	TEMPORARY MAGNET S DON'T LAST VERY LONG
Line_5600	M ACTUALLY IT HAS TO
Line_5601	ONE IS CONNECTED UM NOT CORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_5602	IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5603	IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A ROUTE
Line_5604	IT'S THE UM ENERGY SOURCE THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE IRON TO CREATE THE ELEPECTRICITY
Line_5605	I SEE A D CELL A LIGHT BULB REALLY SMALL LIGHT BULB AND SOME WIRE
Line_5606	THOSE ARE THE WIRES WHICH THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR START T
Line_5607	UM A WELL IT CHARGES THINGS
Line_5608	UM THE ENERGY IT COMES IN FROM ONE END AND THE UM COMES OUT AND THE OTHER
Line_5609	ITS IS UM
Line_5610	IT IS UM CHARGING THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR GOES AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH YE T
Line_5611	IT SHOWED S THE UM THE CIMBLES
Line_5612	UM I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR
Line_5613	IF THEY WEREN'T UM NEXT TO THE UM FOR THE MOTOR OR THE D CELL CIMBLES THEN IT WOULDN'T RUN
Line_5614	THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5615	WE JUST FINISHED UM LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY AND CLASS RIGHT A COUPLE OF MINTS AGO
Line_5616	THEN THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB SO UH THE LIGHT BULB CAN NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5617	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CAN MAGNETISM ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5618	WELL THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER UM MAGNETS ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_5619	UM GIVING EACH OTHER WAY THEY ARE REPELLING
Line_5620	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_5621	UM WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_5622	WELL IF IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT BUT IT'S IF IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WON'T BURN OUT
Line_5623	THAT THE WIRES UM AREN'T LIKE REALLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_5624	IF THERE IS ANOTHER LIGHT BULB OR UM THEY ALL BURN OUT
Line_5625	UH WELL UH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FASTER AND THE PARALLEL UH CIRCUIT
Line_5626	WELL IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FAST IT'S FASTER THEN THE SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5627	ES MORE ELECTRICITY A MORE POWER
Line_5628	OR POWER THEN A SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5629	BUT IT HAS M MORE WIRES
Line_5630	ASHWAY AND FOR THE PARALLEL IT'S TWO PATHWAYS WHICH IS GIVING IT MORE POWER
Line_5631	WE'VE ALL BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5632	THEY'RE UM STUFF THAT ARE LIKE THAT I USED ELECTRICITY
Line_5633	T THAT IT'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5634	IT IT'S GIVING IT MORE POWER A THE MAGNET MORE POWER
Line_5635	WHEN WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A KIND OF UM MAGNET
Line_5636	YES UHM
Line_5637	ONLY YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5638	I HAVE TO GO MARNIE SEE YOU
Line_5639	PENS AN ELECTRICITY
Line_5640	THEY ARE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY UM POWER TRAVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5641	THAT IT HAS POWDER INSIDE IT
Line_5642	IT HAS A LOT OF ENERGY S
Line_5643	UM THE BATTERY IS UM ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GIVING IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5644	IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLES AND IT'S GIVING POWER TO THE MOTOR
Line_5645	UH THE MOTOR HAS UH FORGET TO BE RUNNING AND IT'S ELECTRICITY
Line_5646	WELL A CLOSED CIRCUIT IS WHERE EVERYTHING GOES LIKE IN CIRCLES
Line_5647	UM A WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING SO IT'S CLOSED
Line_5648	UH UH IT CARRIES POWER
Line_5649	IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY RUN AND IT LETS THE MOTOR ER UM SPIN RUN
Line_5650	UM CLOSED CIRCUITS UH GOING CIRCLES
Line_5651	IT'S OFF BECAUSE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING GIVING IT POWERS
Line_5652	I SEE AN UM AND UM A SIMPLE
Line_5653	WELL IN ORDER TO LIKE THE BULB THERE NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER WIRE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WIRE IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5654	ER MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_5655	ENERGY IS FLOW RING FLOWING THROUGH THEM
Line_5656	ET THE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UH WHERE THE OTHER WIRE IS HITTING
Line_5657	NEED ENERGY TO FLOW IN ORDER TO HEIGHT THE PAP
Line_5658	VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5659	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5660	I SEE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY'RE SHARING THEY'RE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATATIVE
Line_5661	TO MAKES TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK INSTEAD OF ONE LIGHT BULB WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5662	HE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AND COMING OUT THE SIDE
Line_5663	SORRY MARNEY ATA GALOW
Line_5664	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETS
Line_5665	AN THE SAME SIDES ATTRACT
Line_5666	THEY'RE REPELLING E
Line_5667	THEY ARE THEY'RE REPELLING BE SO THEYRE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5668	THEY HAVE SO MUCH FORCE SO THEY JUST THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_5669	THE MAGNET IS PUTTING A LOT OF FORCE IN THE NAIL SO THAT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5670	UM IT IS HANGING FROM THE PIC IT THE PAPER CLIP IS HANGING HANGING FROM THE NAIL
Line_5671	WE'VE BEEN LIGHTING LIGHT BULBS AND POWERING MOTORS
Line_5672	PARALLEL CIRCUIT WHEN LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UH THE OTHER ONE KEEPS ON
Line_5673	WHEN A LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT ON A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS STICKS
Line_5674	AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT LIGHT BULBS A UM A AR BRIGHTER
Line_5675	THERE ARE TWO WEIGHS S
Line_5676	GOING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE D CELL TO I HOPE
Line_5677	THIS SHOWS A A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5678	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5679	TOP LIGHT BULBS A BATTERY
Line_5680	IT OR IF IT BURNS IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOO THE BATTERY HAS TO MUCH
Line_5681	THE POWER'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY AND GOING TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5682	AND ONE THE BATTERY IS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE THE BOTTOM THE BATTERY IS ON THE BOTTOM
Line_5683	IF I CLICK ON IT UM ONE TURNS GONE AND ONE TWO SALTS
Line_5684	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5685	IF THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTING TO BOTH THEM THE WIRE GOES OUT TOO AND THEY BOTH HOLD THEY BOTH BURN
Line_5686	THERE'S A LIT UM A
Line_5687	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5688	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING TO THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB S
Line_5689	E IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT AND TO SERIES IS ON THE LEFT
Line_5690	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT NOT THE OTHERS DO
Line_5691	AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UH
Line_5692	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE IT GOES BOTH WAYS AND ON A SERIES CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY ONLY TRAVELS ONE WAYS
Line_5693	THERE IS TWO UM THERE IS TWO WEIGHS FOUR AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_5694	E ELECTRICITY ONLY GOES ONE WAY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_5695	IT ONLY GOES ONE WAY IN A SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5696	THE ELECTRICITY IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT TRAVELS BOTH WAYS AND ELECT AND ELECTRICITY AND SERIES CIRCUIT TRAVELS ONLY ONE WAYS
Line_5697	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT THE OTHER ONES WON'T BURNT OUT
Line_5698	A SEEERY I MEAN I A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5699	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5700	PUTTING A PAPER CLIP ON THE BOX AND THEN IF IT STICK IF IT STICKS TO THE BOX THAT MEANS THERE IS THE MAGNET
Line_5701	H PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5702	WELL IT WAS KIND OF HARD TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE MAGNET WAS
Line_5703	IT'S LIKE MOVING AROUND
Line_5704	THEY SEPARATE
Line_5705	THE PAPER CLIPS STARTED TO SPIN AROUND ON IT GOT CLOSER TO THE MAGNET
Line_5706	THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLE ARE CONNECTING
Line_5707	IT'S STICKING TO THE BOX
Line_5708	CEPT UM LIKE STICKING ONCE IT ONCE WE GOT CLOSER IT KEPT PULLING ITSELF ALL THE WAY TO THE MAGNET
Line_5709	IT LIKES
Line_5710	STUCK TO A BOX AND NO IT DIDN'T FALL OFF SO WE KNEW THERE WAS A MAGNET THERE
Line_5711	IT STARTED ATTRACTING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5712	MOST OF THE IRON FRAIL LINES ARE UM LINED UP AND SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE ALL MIXED CUP
Line_5713	IT HAS METAL AND IRON IN IT SO THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_5714	THEN NORTH KEPT MOVING TO THE MAGNET
Line_5715	US IS MADE FROM IRON SO IT MAKES IT STICK TO METAL
Line_5716	NORTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT AND NORTH AND NORTH AND OR SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_5717	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BATTERIES
Line_5718	THOSE ARE WIRES THAT CONNECTED A BATTERY AND MOVE TO ENDING
Line_5719	WELL THE BATTERY IS UM
Line_5720	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH THEM
Line_5721	THEY BRING THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR WHICH POWERS THE M MOTOR
Line_5722	IN THE CIRCUIT THE ENERGY IS TRAVELING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_5723	IF CIRCUIT IT KIND KIND IT SOUNDS LIKE CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5724	IT KEEPS TURNING AROUND BECAUSE CIRCUIT KIND A S SOUND LIKE A CIRCLE SO IT GOES IN A CIRCLE
Line_5725	THE MOTOR STARTS MOVE IN G
Line_5726	UM IT'S GOING GREAT NOW
Line_5727	IN SCIENCE RIGHT NOW I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5728	UM SO THE THING WITH THE PLUS ON THE MINE'S IS IS A BATTERY
Line_5729	UM THE THE RED THINGY IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5730	THE A GREEN STUFF IS WIRES
Line_5731	D CELLS POWERS OBJECTS
Line_5732	TH THE BATTERY PROVIDES AN ELECTRIC PATHWAY TO POWER A LIGHT BULB
Line_5733	IN SCIENCE I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND OTHER CIRCUIT
Line_5734	I THINK ONE BATTERY IS LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5735	THE CIRCUITS I SEE THERE IS A PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5736	THE LIGHT BULB IS LOWERING TWO NO THE BATTERY IS POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT THE SAME TIME AND TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5737	THE BULB DOTS ARE CARRYING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULB POWERING IT
Line_5738	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IT'S COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF BATTERY TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5739	I I AM SEEING TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5740	BECAUSE IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5741	WELL THE CIRCUIT L NO RIGHT HAS IS A PARALLEL PATHWAY AND THE CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS A SERIES
Line_5742	UH NO
Line_5743	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
Line_5744	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT UH MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_5745	EVEN UM SEEING IF MAGNETS STICK ON STUFF
Line_5746	Y PAPER CLIPS AND UM
Line_5747	MAGNETS STUCK TO LIKE STEEL MOST LEAVES STOOL
Line_5748	WELL THE MAGNET'S STICKING AND THEN THE MAGNET IT'S NOT STICKING TO THE SAME MAGNET FOR SOME REASON
Line_5749	THE MAGNET STUCK TO THE ONE CAUSE THE TO THE TWO SIDES UM AND THE WELL
Line_5750	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE ONE BUT THEN THE OTHER WILL RISE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU FLIP THE MAGNET OVER THEN ONE OF THE SIDES WON'T STICK
Line_5751	WELL THE MAGNETS UM I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY ONE
Line_5752	UM I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
Line_5753	CAN'T THINK OF ANY ME
Line_5754	THERE IS THE WORDS THAT UM YOU LIKE PUT STUFF ON IT LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON YOUR DESK
Line_5755	UM YOU TRY TO YOU PUT UM WIRES ON IT AND A MOTOR AND YOU TRY TO FI T OUT WHERE THE UM WIRES ARE
Line_5756	THERE IS A WIRE CONNECTED UM TO D UM A
Line_5757	IT CONNECTS TO THESE UM I THINK THE BRASS THINGS OR THEY MIGHT BE A STEEL
Line_5758	WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LITTLE GOLD THING ON TOP
Line_5759	IT'S WIRE INSIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD
Line_5760	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH FORT WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5761	WELL THE UM CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM I FORGOT WHAT A CIRCUIT WAS
Line_5762	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING BACK
Line_5763	THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY I THINK
Line_5764	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE D CELL I THINK
Line_5765	THE UM LIGHT BULBS E LIKE ARE BRIGHTER WHEN YOU WHEN THERE IS TWO BATTERIES BUT THEY'RE DIMMER WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE
Line_5766	IT MAKES THE LIGHTBULBS LIGHTER
Line_5767	UM I DON'T KNOW A B
Line_5768	I I WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE DAY SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5769	DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID CAUSE THAT WASN'T THERE FOR SCIENCE
Line_5770	M I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING BECAUSE I WASN'T HERE TODAY
Line_5771	I CAN EXPLAIN AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5772	MAGNETS ARE REALLY STICKING I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY O SPACERS
Line_5773	I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN'T OBSERVE ANY THING ELSE IN
Line_5774	I DON'T I CAN'T FORGET WHAT THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_5775	WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5776	WELL UM THE UHM THE D CELL BATTERY IS LIGHTING THE TWO UM LIGHT BULBS
Line_5777	THE ONE IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM BRIGHTER
Line_5778	THE BLUE DEC IS THE UM ENERGY OR THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMING BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_5779	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5780	TWO CIMBLES ON THE SIDE EQUAL LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE TWO CUMBLES IN THE MIDDLE EQUAL UM BATTERY
Line_5781	IT MEANS IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5782	IT'S GOING REALLY GOOD I MEAN PRETTY GOOD
Line_5783	I THAT WHAT I FORGOT WHAT I WAS DOING SCIENCE
Line_5784	UM WELL IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE WEIGHT I FORGOT SORRY
Line_5785	WELL IF YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE D CELL AND THEN YOU TOUCHED THE OTHER ENDS OF THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5786	WELL THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF UM OH I I FORGOT
Line_5787	THINK LIKE THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5788	WELL IF YOU PUT LIKE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT UM UH I I FORGOT
Line_5789	A CIRCUIT CAN IF YOU ATTACH WIRES TO THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_5790	THE UM WIRES ARE TAKING POWER FROM THE UM D CELL PRETTY MUCH THEN IT'S GIVING THE POWER TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5791	I I THINK IT MIGHT BE LIKE ELECTRICITY BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5792	IT'S WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UM TO THE D CELL AND Y YEAH
Line_5793	WELL YOU A TO THE WA ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB ELSE IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_5794	WELL ONE NEEDS TO TOUCH ON THE BOTTOM ONE NEEDS TOUCH ON THE SIDE ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WON'T TURN ON
Line_5795	MORE OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW I
Line_5796	I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5797	WELL WE WERE LIKE DOING THE THING WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_5798	WELL WE USED A WIRE A A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR AND A LITTLE PLATFORM AND THEN A SWITCH
Line_5799	WELL THE D CELL CONE IS LIKE THE IS THE ELECTRIC SOURCE PRITY MUCH
Line_5800	HE A D CELL IS THE SOURCE
Line_5801	IT PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY PRETY MUCH
Line_5802	WIRES GLOW THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5803	I THINK IT'S LIKE IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY OR EL OR ELECTRICITY PRETTY MUCH IT THINK
Line_5804	WELL IT'S SPINNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRES AND WIRES ARE PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE MOTOR
Line_5805	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL THE METALS TOUCHING THE WIRE PUT OH SO YEAH
Line_5806	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5807	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IS SPINNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_5808	WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE MOTOR
Line_5809	BOTTOM IT'S PRETTY IT'S A LIGHT BULB I MEAN UH D CELL BATTERY OR A BATTERY ON THE TOP IT'S A LIGHT BULBS
Line_5810	WITCH I THINK I THINK THAT'S A LIKE A SWITCH
Line_5811	THE ELECTRIC THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS PICKING UP UH WHOLE ENTRY MAGNETS
Line_5812	THE LESS WRAPS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5813	IT GETS STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5814	IT GETS MORE MAGNET IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5815	IT PICKS UP MORE UM WASHERS
Line_5816	WELL UM THE STRENGTH IS GETTING S WELL UM IT GETS STRONGER
Line_5817	YOU COULD WRAP A WIRE AROUND IT
Line_5818	BECAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
Line_5819	UM THAT IT GETS STRONGER EVERY TIME THE MORE WIRES
Line_5820	BE LIKE TWENTY UM NOT TO SURE BUT
Line_5821	WELL I M WENT TO WHERE THE NINETY FIVE WOULD BE ON THE GRASS AND THEN I WENT OVER AND IT LOOKED LIKE GOOD BE ON FIFTEEN
Line_5822	THERE'S A THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS I THINK
Line_5823	WELL SINCE THE PAPER CLIP STEEL IT'S PRETTY IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVES
Line_5824	MOST OF THEM ARE MADE FROM STEEL SOME OF THEM ARE ALUMINIUM TH
Line_5825	STEEL AND ALUMINIUM
Line_5826	THEY'RE ALL NOT STEEL ARE ALL COMING ONE
Line_5827	AND LITERS ARE LIKE UM SPUNGES ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5828	IN ILOWITORS ARE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT STEEL
Line_5829	ELL A L WELL STEEL UM CAN GET PICKED UP BY A MAGNET ALUMINIUM IT CAN
Line_5830	THEY'RE ALL STEEL
Line_5831	HI MARNIE MY NAME IS NICKALLIN HOW ARE YOU DOING DO KNOW WHAT THE DAY IS
Line_5832	WE'VE BEEN TESTING MAGNETS ON A DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY STICK OR NOT
Line_5833	THEY UHM THROUGH ALL EITHER STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CONTAINS IRON OR IRON
Line_5834	ONE NAIL IS NOT IRON OR STEEL
Line_5835	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO UM IRON OR STEEL UM ONE OF THEM WASN'T MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT WON'T STICK
Line_5836	THE MAGNETIC FORCE CAN AND GENERATE AROUND LIKE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO STICK TO OTHER THINGS
Line_5837	EL CAN GO THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5838	ONE OF THE MAGNETS IS GENERATING A MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE TABLE SO IT'S MAKING IT STICK
Line_5839	I'M NOT SURE HOW IT DOES IT BUT MAGNETS CAN JUST SOMEHOW GENERATE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE ANOTHER MAGNET STICK
Line_5840	UM THE THICKNESS REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO THICK THEN MAGNETIC FORCE WON'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_5841	UM THAT ALL THE MAGNETIC DOMAINS INSIDE ARE ALL FACING THE SAME WAY AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH INTO TURNED IN PRETTY MUCH TURNED INTO A MAGNET
Line_5842	UM THEN IT OR THE MAGNET FIELD AROUND IT AND IT MADE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5843	THE MAGNET HADN'T BEEN WA TO CHARGE THE NAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO IT DIDN'T STIR TO THE PAPERCLIP
Line_5844	BECAUSE THE MAGNET CHART CENTNAIL PUT A MAGNETIC FILED AROUND IT UM SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5845	A CIRCUIT IS A WAI G FOR ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL AND IT MAKES SOME KIND OF CIRCLE FORM
Line_5846	UM ELECTRICITY TRAVEL A CIRCUIT IS THE WA TO LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL
Line_5847	IT'S FORMING A CIRCLE B
Line_5848	IT HAS TO GO FROM THE MINUS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE PLUS SIDES
Line_5849	ONE HAS UM MORE THINGS IN IT THE OTHER ONE GUESSES A BAT BULB CIRCUIT
Line_5850	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS JUST BASICALLY
Line_5851	IT'S GOING FROM THE MINE SIDE UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB DOWN AND THEN UP INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN DOWN AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND IT CUT KEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5852	IT SHOWS LIKE HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_5853	AND TWO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_5854	IT GOES AROUND INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB UM OUT OF THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE BATTERY GETS E CIRCLING
Line_5855	I'VE ALREADY SAID ENOUGH ABOUT SLOW
Line_5856	M THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE BRINGS IT IN
Line_5857	NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU TURN IT THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALWAYS GOING TO PUT THE ELECTRICITY OUT ON THE PLUS SIDE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING IT IN
Line_5858	TH THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE STILL GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5859	THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM S YOU SEE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS COMING OUT OF
Line_5860	IN SETTING INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A WIRE IS JUST GOING INTO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEN OUT AGAIN
Line_5861	TWO BATTERIES HAS MORE POWER THAN ONE SO THE LIGHT BULBS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT A BRIGHTER
Line_5862	I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME SO I
Line_5863	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE CUP SO THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5864	THE BACK SURELY IT BREAKS THE MAGNETIC FORCE AS THE WEIGHT FROM THE WASHERS
Line_5865	IT'S MOVING THE BACK IT'S MOVING THE MAGNET'S FARTHER APART
Line_5866	MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AT THE CUP SO THEY CAN STICK BUT IT'S DCREETS BUT MAY MAGNETIC FORCES DECREASING WHEN THE SPACERS ARE PUT BETWEEN THE
Line_5867	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE EITHER HALF LIKE A MAGNET MAGNET S TOGETHER AND WASHERS
Line_5868	MAYBE PRICE USED DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WE'RE IN A STRONG
Line_5869	WE WERE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY WE TALKED A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANIMALS THAT USED ELECTRICITY TO FIND FOOD AND KEEP PRESENCE AWAY
Line_5870	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE UM BOTH PARALLEL TO ON PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER
Line_5871	NO MATTER WHICH WAY THE BATTERY IS TURNED UM IT'LL ELECTRICITY ALWAYS GO OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ALWAYS GO IN UH TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5872	THE FLOW IS GOING UP PUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AROUND AND THEN THE FLOW WILL BE GOING DOWN
Line_5873	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY AND WHEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5874	THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5875	THE MINE SIDE IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY OUT THEN ITS FILLING UP INTO LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5876	THERE ARE FOUR PATHWAYS TWO FOR EACH
Line_5877	EVERYWHERE ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS IT'S GREEN THOUGH ELECTRICITY FLOWS ALL THROUGH IT
Line_5878	THE CIRCLE IS THE LOOPS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LITTLE THE PLAIN LINES ARE
Line_5879	EVERYTHING IN IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN A CIRCUIT
Line_5880	IT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE IS TWO LIGHT WALLS AND IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5881	WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5882	WELL SINCE IT'S AN ELECTRO MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR IT TO BE TO PICK MAGNETIC THINGS UP
Line_5883	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AROUND OR ELSE IT WON'T REALLY WORK
Line_5884	THE WIRES IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5885	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS COMPLETELY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_5886	H IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN IT IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_5887	IT HAS TO BE IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FROM THE MAGNETS TO WORK
Line_5888	IT THE WASHERS WILL START STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_5889	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE RIVET TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5890	IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
Line_5891	THE CIRCUITS HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK AND IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_5892	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH PROPERLY BUT IF IT'S NOT THEN THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5893	DON'T KNOW
Line_5894	A TEMPORARY MAGNET DOESN'T MEANS IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER SO ELECTROMAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS A MAGNET
Line_5895	UM SO MAG THAT SOME MAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5896	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND MAKE THE L
Line_5897	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5898	THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY TYPE THAT WORKS AS A NORMAL MAGNET THAT WILL STICK ALIKE A NORMAL MAGNET
Line_5899	IT KIND OF PUTS THE ENERGY OUT INTO THE WIRES SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE SOURCE OF IT
Line_5900	UM THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5901	THE LET THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT SO IT CAN LIKE GO TO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT TO GO TO
Line_5902	THEY LET THE UM ELECTRIC CITY KIND F ROW THROUGH SO THEY KINDA LIKE THE PAT UP THE LITTLE PATHWAY
Line_5903	IT'S KIND OF WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT NEEDS ELECTRICITY SO
Line_5904	A A RECEIVER MEANS THAT YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5905	IT USES THE ELECTRICITY TO START RUNNING
Line_5906	IT'S RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S RUNNING
Line_5907	WHENCE THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING METAL IT THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_5908	IT'S TOUCHING A METAL AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5909	IT'S TOUCHING TO THE BATTE L
Line_5910	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5911	MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCLE
Line_5912	IT'S GOING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE MOTOR OUT OF THE MOTOR AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_5913	E EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EITHER LIKE TOUCHING A BATTERY OR METAL
Line_5914	THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES FLOWING TO THE LITTLE CIRCLE WITH THE THING ON IT
Line_5915	THE CIRCLE WITH ALUMINETS IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5916	A BATTERY ONE SIDE IS THE PLUS ONE LINE IS THE PLUS SIDE THE OTHER SIDE IS THE MINE SIDE
Line_5917	THERE IS A BATTERY A MOTOR AND TWO IRON S
Line_5918	IT'S THE MOTOR UM THE M IS PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE MOTORS STICK TO THEM
Line_5919	THE LITTLE LINE IS A DOT ON THE ENDS IS A SWITCH
Line_5920	IT SHOWS YOU A WAY TO SET UP THE CIRCUITS
Line_5921	THEY'RE MAGNETS LIKE S USE ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS MAGNETS
Line_5922	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5923	IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRO MAGNETS TO WORK
Line_5924	A A CLOSED CIRCUIT LETS ELECTRICITY FLOW BUT AN OPEN CIRCUIT DOESN'T
Line_5925	THE MORE WIRNES YOU PUT ON THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS
Line_5926	IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED WINDS IT SUPER STRONG SO YOU CAN PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIKE FIVE IT COULD ONLY PICK UP LIKE TWO OR THREE
Line_5927	IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT MAKES THE MAG THE ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
Line_5928	THE MORE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIVET THE STRONGER IT IS
Line_5929	THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UM OR STUFF
Line_5930	M HOW MUCH CHARGED THE BATTERY HAS AND HOW LET AND THE SWITCH
Line_5931	MORE WINDS GIVES IT MORE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS SO IF IT HAS MORE WINDS IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS S
Line_5932	UM YOU CAN WIND IT MORE
Line_5933	THE MORE WINDS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP
Line_5934	IT GETS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN GET
Line_5935	PROBABLY IN A BAR GRAM LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TEN WINDS THREE WASHERS TWENTY WINES FIVE WASHERS AND IT KEEPS YOWING UP
Line_5936	THE NUMBERS KEEPS GOING UP
Line_5937	TE MORE ELECTRICITY THE STRONGER THE MAGNET GETS
Line_5938	IF IT DOESN'T PICK UP VERY MANY THEN THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY WRAPS BUT IF IT PICKS UP A LOT THEN IT HAS A LOT OF WRAP
Line_5939	WELL MADE GOT FIFTEEN AND HALF OF TEN IT'S FIVE AND TEN ONLY GOT THREE
Line_5940	THAT THINGS ON THE LEFT TO THE WIRE'S ER THE SWITCH MAYBE TO SEE IF IT'LL MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON
Line_5941	CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEM BECAUSE THEY CONDUCT IF KIND OF
Line_5942	THE CONDUCTORS WERE PRTY MUCH ALL METAL THINGS AND THEY LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEM
Line_5943	WHAT'S LEVER IN THE CIRCUIT LIKE THE LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR WILL TURN ON
Line_5944	YOU CLOSED THE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF TOUCHING THE SWITCH TO METAL UM YOU PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL ON IT THING TO CLOSE IT
Line_5945	IT CAN CLOSE A CIRCUIT AND LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH
Line_5946	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEY DON'T CLOSE THE CIRCUIT SO NOTHING WILL TURN ON
Line_5947	CONDUCTORS LET THE CIRCUIT TURN ON BUT INSULATORS DON'T
Line_5948	THE MOTOR STANDS STILL BECAUSE INSOLITARS ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE OF METAL
Line_5949	INSULATORS ARE NOT REALLY MADE OF METAL STRAWS WOOD ROCKS AND LIKE SPONCHES AND NONE OF THEM ARE MADE OF METAL
Line_5950	HEY DON'T CLOSE A CIRCUIT SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON
Line_5951	THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF CONDUCTORS UM THEY CAN CLOSE A CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL USUALLY
Line_5952	IRON AND STEEL WHICH ARE BOTH METAL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5953	OR PULSE OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_5954	UH MY NAME IS KEATHIAMOSOM
Line_5955	MAGNET IS A MAGNET A MAGNET ATTRACTS IRON
Line_5956	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASSROOM WE WERE DOING WEEDORING MAGNETISM AND I TOLD YOUR SAY THAT
Line_5957	A REPEL AND ATTRACT
Line_5958	WELL THE END AND THE END BOUNCE OFF AND THE END AND THE ES COME TOGETHER AND THE ES AND THE END COME TOGETHER BUT THE ES AND THE ES BOUNDS OFF
Line_5959	O CLAIM DONE
Line_5960	WELL THEY HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE BRADS AND THE BRADS HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER WIRE UNDER UM UNDER THE BOARD
Line_5961	THEY THEY ARE CALLED BRADS OR COMPONENTS ARMING CONDUCTORS
Line_5962	IF IF THE BRADS WEREN'T METAL THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT IT IT WOULD JUST IT WOULDN'T JUST GO THROUGH IT AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T
Line_5963	UH WELL THE WIRE UNDERNEATH THE BANKS UM MAKES THE IT MAKES IT A WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_5964	BECAUSE THE IRON BECAUSE THE IRON AND THE UM ATTRACTS TO EACH OTHER
Line_5965	IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPEL WHEN THEY ATTRACT
Line_5966	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE REALLY STRONG AND THEY CAN GO THROUGH REALLY THICK THINGS S
Line_5967	WELL IF IT GOES THROUGH THINGS THAT MEANS A MAGNET REALLY STRONG
Line_5968	UM A TABLE UH UM A WASHER
Line_5969	WELL THE THICKNESS IS LIKES
Line_5970	OUT WE'RE ALL THE MAGNETIC UM WE'RE THE MAGNET IS MAKING UM THE NAIL
Line_5971	IT KNOWS ME THAT THERE'S MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE UM NAIL SO THAT IT WILL ATTRACT TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5972	YOU HAVE TO UM SLIDE THE MAGNET ACROSS THE UM NAIL SO IT WOULD MAKE A MAGNETIC FIELD TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5973	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT KAY I DON'T KNOW IS THE WEIGHT
Line_5974	WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE IT HAS WIRES AND IT ON THE IT WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT BECAUSE
Line_5975	ELECTRICITY IS A TRAVEL FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE
Line_5976	UM BECAUSE ONE THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB UM AND TWO WIRES AND THE OTHERS THERE IS THREE WIRES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5977	ITS GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5978	WELL IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND FLOWS OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5979	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5980	WELL YOU AND ARE I DON'T DO
Line_5981	WELL IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T UHM BE LIT AS MUCH
Line_5982	WELL IF THERE IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T BE AS LAST
Line_5983	WELL THE ENERGY UM FLOWS THROUGH UH BOTH BATTERIES AND GETS MORE POWER TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS MORE
Line_5984	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIT MORE AND THE ONE WAS ONE BATTERY WOOD UM WE LIT LESS
Line_5985	UM THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES IS LIGHT UM MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS A LOT MORE BRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY MAKES LIGHT BULBS UM DIM
Line_5986	IF YOU DIDN'T ADD MORE UM ANOTHER BATTERY OR MORE POWER THE LIGHTBULBS WOULD BE STILL DIM
Line_5987	UM THE ENERGY UM S MORE IS MORE POWDERED AND IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB ON THE LIGHT MORE
Line_5988	WHEN YOU HAVE TO D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IT'S WHEN
Line_5989	WELL WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT MORE
Line_5990	WELL THERE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES AND WIRES CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_5991	UM WELL I'S STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5992	HERE IS TWO UM PATHWAYS ON THIS PARALLEL CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE IN THE LEFT
Line_5993	UH I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER IT
Line_5994	THE BLUE DOTS THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING REALLY FASTER THE LIGHT BULB POWER THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5995	GOING INTO THE BATTERY AT THE UM POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN GETTING RE CHARGE AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND POWERING LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
Line_5996	UM THERE IS TWO UM LIGHT BULBS BOTH POWER THE LOUGHT AND TWO FOUR UM WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5997	T'S UM IT'S SHOWING TWO LIGHT BULBS FOUR WIRES AND A BATTERY OF A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5998	THE MIDDLE ASEMBLE UM REPRESENT A BATTERY
Line_5999	EN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6000	USE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM THAT'S LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6001	IT MEANS THAT THE WIRES ARE NEVER TOUCHING AND THEY'RE JUST GOING ON AND THEY NEVER TOUCH
Line_6002	IT TELLS ME THAT THE THAT THE BATTERY CHARGES BOTH LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6003	THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
Line_6004	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_6005	MEAN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO ELECTRICITY WILL TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_6006	UM WELL IT'S IMPORTANT B
Line_6007	CH IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT CAN TURN OFF THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OR ON THE HOT CIRCUIT
Line_6008	HO NO IDEA
Line_6009	UM A
Line_6010	T IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT UM AND I WAS PUTTING IT AGAINST THE WASHERS THAT IT WASN'T PICKING IT UP T ANY WASHERS
Line_6011	WELL THE THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET SO THAT THE WRITE CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6012	IT HAS TO BE WAITED FROM LIKE A STEEL OR IRON
Line_6013	WE WENT UM WE WRAPPED IT AROUND FIVE AND THEN TEN TIMES AND THEN FIFTEEN AND THEN TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY FIVE AND TEN THIRTY
Line_6014	IF YOU IT SHOWS THAT THAT IF YOU YOU WRAPPED IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MEANS IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6015	MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM THAT YOU WRAP THE WIRE UH A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET
Line_6016	WELL IT'S IT GETS MORE STRENGTH BY IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND IF YOU WRAP IF YOU WRAP THE WIRES AROUND IT MORE E
Line_6017	IF IT PICKS OR WASHERS SINCE IT S AN ELECTROMAGNET IS STRONGER
Line_6018	BY WRAPPING THE UH THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET LIKE MORE
Line_6019	WELL THE MORE YOU WIND IT AROUND THE RI- UM THE MORE YOU WIND THE WIRES AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6020	IF IF YOU KEEP WRAPPING IT AROUND MORE AROUND THE VEIRVIT THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6021	IT'S STRONGER THAN A WASHER THAT PICKS UP A FEW WASH A WASHERS
Line_6022	IT GETS STRONGER BECAUSE MORE AL ELECTRICITY IS GOING AROUND IT SO IT GETS STRONGER AND UM IT CAN PICK UP MORE
Line_6023	WELL IT SHOWS THAT WHEN I INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WRAPS THE MORE WASHERS IT GETS SO
Line_6024	UH YEAH
Line_6025	UM WELL THE NUMBER WRAPS GETS HIRED SO LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINETY A HUNDRED
Line_6026	NUMBER WRAPS GETS LARGER THE THE HIRE THE LITTLE GREEN DOTS GO AND THE HIRE THE UM THE GREEN LINE GO
Line_6027	THE WASHERS ARE GETTING SO THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE WASHERS AND MORE WRAPS
Line_6028	WELL INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT UM THAT IF YOU PUT ATTACH THEM TO THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY WON'T THROW THROUGH UM AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6029	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH THE UM ROCKS OR THE SPONGE AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6030	IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR ATTACH TO THE WIRE THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING
Line_6031	L THE SRAWL IS MADE OF PLASTIC SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_6032	THEY ARE ALL CONDUCTOR AND THEY ALL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6033	S STEEL METAL ALUMINIUM ANYTHING THAT CAN STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_6034	WELL A METAL HAS IRON IN IT AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IRON IN CERTAIN THINGS TO STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6035	YES MARNEY YOU DID REPEAT YOURSELF AND YOU DIDN'T FOR A GOOD CH
Line_6036	I I'VE BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME
Line_6037	SOME OF THEM WILL STICK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM WON'T
Line_6038	VERY WELL ON HAVING SO MUCH FUN HOW MUCH YOU
Line_6039	WELL THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BOARDS AND THEY HAVE BRADS AND THEY HAVE A WIRE THROUGH THERE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WIRE IS SO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_6040	WELL IF THERE IS NO WIRE BEHIND THE BOARD THEN THE LIGHT BULBS OR THE MOTOR WOULD NEVER LIGHT UP
Line_6041	WELL THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE RUNNING FROM EACH END TO THE BAT
Line_6042	WELL THEY'RE EASY TO PUT YOUR WIRE TO A AND THE METAL
Line_6043	WELL METAL WELL ELECTRICITY CAN RUN THROUGH METAL AND THIS CASE IT IS METAL AND UM SO IT JUST THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE PA AND YEAH
Line_6044	WELL BEHIND EACH GRAB THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED
Line_6045	IT TELLS ME THAT BEHIND A AND B BRASS ARE CONNECTED TO A SMALL WIRE THAT COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT
Line_6046	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HANG ON
Line_6047	I THINK IT TO FORCE THE MAGNETS UM I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S THE FORCE JUST BECAUSE I GUESS
Line_6048	WELL A SORT OF DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS IS DOING
Line_6049	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE NAIL IS ACTING U S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6050	AH YOU HAVE TO RUB IT ON TOP THE NAIL OR STICK IT ON THE END FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THE MAGNET FIELD CAN GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_6051	THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMP LE RE MAGNET
Line_6052	LET IT SO WEIGH HANG ON
Line_6053	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND UM TRIAL LIGHT TO LIGHT BULBS YEAH
Line_6054	WELL THE ELECTRICITY GOES SORT OF ON A PATHWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THE LIKE BULB AND BACK OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6055	WELL ONE OF THEM IS POWERING TWO BATTERIES I MEAN TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6056	WELL THAT'S A HAVE TO SHARE THE ELECTRICITY SO ONE THEM SO THEY BOTH GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER SO THEY CAN BOTH GET LIGHT UP
Line_6057	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE IN THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_6058	WE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6059	WELL THE BLUE SORTA SHOW ELECTRICITY I GUESS
Line_6060	WELL OF COURSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THE BATTERY IN TO THE POSIT SIZES BATTERY
Line_6061	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH BOTH BATTERY AND THEN THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
Line_6062	WELL WELL THE IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6063	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT T INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_6064	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_6065	UM THAT END THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_6066	ITS REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE WAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6067	WELL IT WORKS BOTH WEIGHTS IT JUST REVERSES THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IT
Line_6068	WELL FLOW IT'S THE WAY IT'S LIKE A PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_6069	WELL IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP A LOT MORE
Line_6070	WELL IT DEFINEILY DOES LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB A LOT MORE
Line_6071	THERE IS MORE UH ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY WHICH MEANS IT FLOWS FASTER
Line_6072	HEY LIT UP THEY THEY LIT UP UM AH LOT BRIGHTER
Line_6073	THE IT A LOT BOTH LIGHT BULBS GET A LOT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THE ROME BATTERY SO THEY EACH POWER THE SAME
Line_6074	WELL WHEN THERE TWO BATTERIES THEY WELL THEY LIGHT UP A LOT BRIGHTER AND WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS MUCH
Line_6075	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING AND IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVE R THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL WORK
Line_6076	MARNEY HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_6077	ONE- THEY GET FASTER
Line_6078	THEY GETS UM THE ELECTRICITY GETS FASTER
Line_6079	AVERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_6080	UM THE FORCE IT GETS WEAKER
Line_6081	THE FORCES UM A STRONGER
Line_6082	WELL WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE PUT WASHERS INTO CUP AT
Line_6083	THERE UM WHAT'S IT CALLED THERE ARE LIKE CHIPS THE CHIPS ARE BETWEEN ON IT UM SO IT IT WEAKENS THE FORCE
Line_6084	UM ADDING SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS UM WEAKENS THE FORCE YOU KNOW OF THE MAGNETS
Line_6085	THE DISTANCE GETS THEY'RE FARTHER APART WHICH MEANS IT WEAKENS THEIR FORCE
Line_6086	DON'T YOU MEAN B UM D
Line_6087	A B AND D GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE THEY DID THE SAME PERCEGERS BUT GROUP A DIDN'T
Line_6088	A WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU U
Line_6089	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_6090	WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T SA THAT
Line_6091	IT WRAPS VERY NEATLY
Line_6092	IT'S CALLED A STEEL RIVET S
Line_6093	UM SO SO THE WIRE CAN FLOW THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_6094	WELL THERE ARE WASHERS DOWN THERE AND IT SORT OF AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE UH ELECTRICITY
Line_6095	WELL YOU NEED TO THINK WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PART IF THERE'S NOT ONE PART THEN THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORKS
Line_6096	WE NEED A WRAPPED AROUND THE THE RIVET VERY VERY LIKE PRECISE
Line_6097	THE WASHERS COME UP AND LIKE CONNECT TO THE RIVET
Line_6098	MORE NOW IT'S UM LIGHT CLOSED
Line_6099	WELL IT JUST AT WHATEVER THE ELECTRO MAGNIC HAD PICKED UP IT DROPS
Line_6100	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AN THE WASHERS GO UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6101	THEN THE WASHERS GO BACK UP INTO THE RIVET S
Line_6102	WELL WITHOUT THE ELECTRICITY THE ELECTRO MAGNET WOULD JUST BE A PLAIN REVERT BUT YOU NEED THE ELECTRICITY TO GO INTO THE RIVET AND PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_6103	BECAUSE THEY
Line_6104	UM THE RIVET OR CORE HAS BEEN MADE FROM IRON TO BE AN ER MAGNET
Line_6105	WELL THAT YOU IT JUST NEEDS TO BE RAPTRON SOMETHING MADE IRON TO BE A TEMPORARY MAGNET RAPPARAM SOMETHING LIKE LE MADE A PLASTIC THAT THING WILL HAPPEN
Line_6106	VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6107	WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN CIRCUITS
Line_6108	YOU NEED A SWITCH A MOTOR A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_6109	THE BATTERY IS THE SOURCE AND THE SOURCE GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO TO JUST SEND THE ELECTRICITY DOWN TO WHATEVER IT'S HOST TO DO
Line_6110	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE PATH FROM THE THE NEGATIVE END OF THE D CELL BACK TO THE POSITIVE
Line_6111	WELL A MOTOR IS WHAT'S A MOTOR COULD BE THE RECEIVER IT COULD BE UM THE MOTOR COULD BE A RECEIVER IT IS THE RECEIVER
Line_6112	A RECEIVE SO AND A RECEIVER IS THE THING THAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6113	MARNE I DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6114	THE MOTOR IS UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_6115	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVERY WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED
Line_6116	THE SIMBLES UM THE LINE WITH THE LONGER LINE THE SHORT LINE THE LONG LINE REPRESENTS THE BATTERY AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE LITTLE LOOP IN THE MIDDLE IS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6117	THE UM IS FOR THE MOTOR
Line_6118	WE'RE MAKING UM UP UM I AND A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6119	ISN'T A WASHER CONDUCTORS TO
Line_6120	INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND THEY BLOCK ELECTRICITY FROM COMING THROUGH
Line_6121	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THRI'LL FLOW THROUGH THEM AND CONDUCTORS DO
Line_6122	WELL ONLY METAL ONES WORKS ON L
Line_6123	UMM I WAS TALKING
Line_6124	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR I MEAN OPEN WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR I
Line_6125	IT'S CLOSED
Line_6126	WELL YOU CAN MAKE METAL TO A A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6127	IS IT UM IT HAS TO BE A UM LIKE STEEL
Line_6128	THEY ALL HAVE TO BE UM STEEL METALS
Line_6129	I HAVE IT TO WORK
Line_6130	YES I DO GET THAT MARNIE
Line_6131	ELS I AM READY
Line_6132	WELL WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT THE SUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6133	H WE HAVE OBSERVED HOW IT CONNECTS TO THINGS AND HOW IT CAN STICK TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC
Line_6134	M CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_6135	THEY CONNECTS TO THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND THAT HAVE IRON IN THEM MOST OF THE TIME
Line_6136	AND THAT'S WHY UM WE DIDN'T CONNECT
Line_6137	BUT THEN THE BOTTOM COMES WERE CONNECTING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALUMINIUM IN THE M
Line_6138	THEY ARE A CLICKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_6139	PUSHED AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALUMINIUM AND NOT IRON LIKE THE OTHER ONE'S
Line_6140	THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN THEM BUT THE THE TWO IN THE MIDDLE DON'T HAVE ANY THING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ALUMINUM
Line_6141	BY NICE MEETING YEAH UM BYE
Line_6142	E DON'T WANNA GET BURN
Line_6143	ARE MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_6144	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS FLOWS THROUGH METAL
Line_6145	HERE HA HAS TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE TO GET A SWITCH
Line_6146	E LIGHTS THE BULB UP IF IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IT MAKES ELECTRICITY AND YES
Line_6147	UH WE NEED TO GO BYE
Line_6148	HALLOW
Line_6149	E JUST PULLED IN JUST ONE IN IT
Line_6150	BUT WHEN YOU LET GO OF THE MAGNET WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS EVERYTHING WILL FALL AND THAT THE PAPER CLIP WON'T BE CONNECTED TO THE NAIL BUT THE NAIL WILL BE CONNECTED
Line_6151	WHEN THE MAGNET IS IS ON THE NAIL IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN WHEN YOU LET GO UP THE MAGNET IT S GOES
Line_6152	THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6153	UM THEN ALL HAPPENED WAS
Line_6154	WEIGHT SO UH
Line_6155	WE'VE BEEN DOING PATHWAYS AND ELECTRICITY C
Line_6156	UM IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT FLOWS IT'S THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE I
Line_6157	A CIRCUIT IS WHERE IT GOES ALL RIGHT THROUGH AND HOW TO BURN IT AND DON'T
Line_6158	UM THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6159	IT CIRCLES AROUND THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WORKS SO
Line_6160	THE BATTERY HAS TO BE POSITIVE TO MAGNET
Line_6161	UM THE FIRST PICTURE THEN ON THE SECOND PIXTURE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6162	THEY CAN PAR BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP
Line_6163	UM ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND ONE HA HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WHICH BUT THEN THEY'RE THEY'RE POINTING THE SAME WAY SO THAT'S CAUSING IT TO KNOW
Line_6164	IT'S DIMMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FOOL A FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_6165	IT IT DOES COMPARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE ONE'S DING AND ONE'S FOULLY WELL
Line_6166	WELL THE BLUE DOTS KEEP GOING AND GOING UNTIL THEY S STOP WHEN YOU JUST CONNECT THE WIRES
Line_6167	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BUL WELL
Line_6168	IT'S IT HAVE TWO NEGATIVE YEAH
Line_6169	UM IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SO THAT IT SHOWS ME THAT THERE THERE IS A FLOW BUT IF THERE IS NOT A FOOL HUNDRED THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_6170	WHEN YOU SWITCH IT IT GOES ONE DIRECTIONS BUT THEN WHEN YOU SWITCHED IT LIKE THAT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_6171	IT ALWAYS FLOWS UH POSITIVE TO NEGATIVES
Line_6172	SLOWING AWAY FROM THE POSITIVES
Line_6173	A'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH LIGHT
Line_6174	IT WORKS LIKE IT DID BEFORE BUT JUST A LITTLE MORE POWDER
Line_6175	I I NOTICE THAT THEY WERE BOTH FLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_6176	THAT ACTUALLY ONE D CELLS CAN BE
Line_6177	THEY'RE LINED UP THE SAME BUT THERE IS FLAB BUT THE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS FLOWING THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION S
Line_6178	WELL IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6179	IT MAKES IT HAVE MORE POWER AND LIGHTS UP MORE
Line_6180	UM IT'S LIGHTS UP MORE BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY
Line_6181	IT'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6182	UM ELECTRICITY MOSTLY
Line_6183	I THINK IT OUT THAT'S UM
Line_6184	IT REPRESENTS TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6185	TALK TO ME ALL OF
Line_6186	WE'VE BEEN FILING WITH MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM
Line_6187	A THERE WAS NINETEEN WASHERS
Line_6188	THE'RE WEIGHT WHAT IS THE THING
Line_6189	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE MAGNETS HAVE ENOUGH FORCE TO GET THROUGH ONE SPACERS SO IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP B AND IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP A
Line_6190	THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACERS THAT IT TOOK THAT THE FORCE COULDN'T STICK TOGETHER AND THEY WOULDN'T STICK SO
Line_6191	FIVE SPACERS NEEDED THREE THREE WASHERS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS ENOUGH
Line_6192	ES ARE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_6193	EDGES FOLLOW THE RULES AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN DO WE
Line_6194	A B EN D GO NINETEEN WASHERS AND THAT WAS ENOUGH IN THE OTHER PICTURES THAT YOU SHOWED ME TO DISCONNECT IT AND THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FORCE
Line_6195	TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS AND A NINE WASHERS AND B IN GROUP D TOOK NINETEWASHERS AND THEN IN GROUP SAME FIVE
Line_6196	SPACERS AND THEN THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
Line_6197	A NINE TEEN BEAN NINE TEEN S FIVE D NINETEEN
Line_6198	IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE RIVETS CAN PICK UP
Line_6199	UM YOU MAKES IT WORK BECAUSE OF THE THE RIVET KIND OF HAS MOST OF THE ENERGY
Line_6200	IT MEANS THAT THERE IS MAGNETISM IN IT AND THAT THERE'S A A LOT OF STUFF IN IT
Line_6201	PROBABLY A WASHER W MAKES IT WORK BUT IT SOMETIMES WON'T
Line_6202	I'M SORRY WHAT
Line_6203	UM WELL IT JUST KIND OF CONNECTS BECAUSE THE FLOW UH THEY PROBABLY
Line_6204	LOW IS THE BELLY WHAT I DRESS IS DOING IF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OR IF IT DOES NOT
Line_6205	I THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S CLOSED THERE IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY SO FLOWING
Line_6206	IT HAS TO BE UM CLOSED FOR IT TO ATTRACT ITS
Line_6207	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM UH
Line_6208	UM IT HAN ER BATTERY POWER WHEN THEY'RE USED TOO MUCH AND IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP IT LOT BUT YET IT MEASURES THE THING YOU JUST MENTION TO MEAN
Line_6209	IT'S A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB STAND WIRES AND A LITTLE STANDS FOR EVERYTHING TO GO INTO
Line_6210	YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER AND THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN LIKE A IN THE BATTERY DID SO
Line_6211	WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IT RECEIVES THE BATTERY AND THE POWER AND THE ELECTRICITY AND G
Line_6212	WHAT I CAN DO IS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT GOES POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE
Line_6213	THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATATIVE ON TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE
Line_6214	BUT AFTER THAT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING WILL JUST STAY THERE AND YEAH
Line_6215	UM ELECTRICITY AND IT FFLOWES YEAH AND JUST FLOW IS N STUFF
Line_6216	UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6217	UM THE BATTERY HELPS THAT IN IT MADE IT WORKS
Line_6218	IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IT CAN FLOW TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WEIGHT THAT IT FLOWS AND SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_6219	UM IT LIGHTS TO LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6220	HM ONE GOES TO THE SIDE AND ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6221	AND THE NEGATIVE GIVE TO THE SIDE
Line_6222	LOSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING FLOWING IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_6223	SO THE POSITIVE GOES TO NEGATI
Line_6224	THE BULB IS A CLOSED IT'S NOT OPEN
Line_6225	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT STUFF TO MAKE LIKE A SWITCH WORK AND MAKE THE LIGHTS LIGHT UP
Line_6226	SO THE SWITCH IS WHAT CONTAINS THE UM
Line_6227	UM G LIKE BHOCKS THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6228	TOP UM THE D CELL BATTERY UM CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_6229	TH D CELL MAKES IT LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE WIRES AND THEN THE MOTOR
Line_6230	UH ELECTRICITY
Line_6231	UM IT HELPS THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6232	IT CARRIES ELECTRICITY POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6233	T CONNECTS AND THAT MAKES IT BOTH LIGHT UP AND THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6234	SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_6235	IT RECEIVES IT AND THEN SHIPS IT OFF TO NEW ORLENDS SORRY Y
Line_6236	UM IT MAKES IT WORK WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT IT SHUTS EVERYTHING OFF WELL
Line_6237	NOW
Line_6238	IT'S MAKING EVERYTHING GO CRAZY
Line_6239	UM WHAT IT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S CLOSE TO THAT IT'S MAKING THE FLAG GO THROUGH
Line_6240	IT'S FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND COME FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_6241	WIRE'S TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6242	IT'S LETTING THE WIRES TOUCH THE MOTOR AND HELPING IT GO ON IN A
Line_6243	THE LIGHT BULB WE
Line_6244	IT'S POLLABLI DIDN'T WORK
Line_6245	WELL THE WELL IT'S JUST A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH
Line_6246	UM THE LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTING TO THE WIRE WIRES UM AND THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR LETTING IT GO THROUGH
Line_6247	A A BATTERY A BATTERY THAT HAS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_6248	IT'S THE MOTOR
Line_6249	THOSE ARE THE WIRES CONNECTING
Line_6250	BATTERY AND MOTOR AND UM WHAT IS THIS
Line_6251	UH WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS I
Line_6252	THEY AVERY VERY STRONG
Line_6253	THERE'S A RIVET AND WASHERS AND THE RAPET'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_6254	IRO-
Line_6255	W WASHERS AND THE RIVET
Line_6256	IT A CLOSED
Line_6257	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STRONG SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6258	THAT THERE'S A WATER WINDS
Line_6259	FORTY THREE ILLAMIE'S THAT THERE IS FORTY THREE WASHERS THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH
Line_6260	UM THE MORE WIRES YOU PUT IN PROBABLY
Line_6261	THE BATTERY PROBABLY LIKE THE POWERS
Line_6262	IT PICKS UP OR WASHERS
Line_6263	UM YOU RAP IF YOU RAP
Line_6264	YOUR BATTERY PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD NEED MORE OF THE POWDER BUT THEN
Line_6265	IT IT LETS IT DOESN'T BRING UP A WA BUT IT USUALLY DOES A
Line_6266	THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT A WATER PAPER
Line_6267	THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TH
Line_6268	BUBBLE WRAPS ON GRA WOULD BE GOOD PROBABLY
Line_6269	ON THE SIDE OF THE DRAFT IT REPRESENTS HOW MANY WASHERS WERE PICKED UP
Line_6270	MORE WASHERS TO PICK UP
Line_6271	IT INCREASES BY TWO AND TEN UP TO ONE
Line_6272	IT GOES TO FIFTEEN STILL BUT IT'S GOING SATURN
Line_6273	AND I'M I'M LIKE UM WHAT THEY DO HERE THEY MICK IT UP TO GO TO FLIM ER OW
Line_6274	THERE WAS A LOT OF STRENGTH S
Line_6275	THIRTY THIRTY PROBABLY
Line_6276	PROBABLY TWENTY ARI TWENTY FIVE
Line_6277	WE'VE BEEN DOING MAGNETISM AND SEEING UHM WHAT COULD MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_6278	UM WELL IF WE TAKE A AN ALUMINIUM NAIL IT ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE MOTOR WORK IF YOU CONNECT THE TWO WIRES TO IT
Line_6279	E A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET A MOTOR WORK
Line_6280	UM IT THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS MAKING IT WORK THE MOTOR IS G
Line_6281	TALK TO ME WEIGHS
Line_6282	INSULATORS S STUFF THAT YOU NOT HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM AND THAT DON'T WORK
Line_6283	Y DON'T INSULATORS DON'T HAVE ANY THEY WON'T LET THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM
Line_6284	WHEN I CLICKED I SPUNGE THE MOTOR DIDN'T WORK IT JUST SAT THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE
Line_6285	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK THE INSULATOR SHUTS DOWN
Line_6286	METAL UH METAL CAN STICK TO IT
Line_6287	AND THE ALUMINIUM ONE IS HAVE ANY METAL OR IRON
Line_6288	A STEEL NAIL WILL CAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND A
Line_6289	MASS WEIGHT
Line_6290	IT'S ABOUT H HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6291	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY UM SO
Line_6292	THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_6293	UM YOU COULD THAT TO THE BRAIN UH
Line_6294	YEAH TO FILL IT TO THE BUMP
Line_6295	YOU COULD TAKE A CIRRINGE AND POUR ONE WATER TO WATER AND SOSOUNTILL YOU GET
Line_6296	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT I I DON'T
Line_6297	OU COULD TAKE A SERRENZION TO IT A YES
Line_6298	MASS OF ACTUALLY VOLUME OH
Line_6299	IT OPEN THE CAN UM AND SO THEY WENT
Line_6300	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS AND WE INSTEAD IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED
Line_6301	IT'S AS MUCH AS THE CANT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6302	IT'S THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLDS
Line_6303	IT'S NOT PULLING AS MUCH AS IT IT
Line_6304	THE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN H POSSIBLY
Line_6305	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6306	TH I CAN REALLY ANSWER THAT WITH MY LEBLE OF KNOWLEDGE NOT SAYING LEM DO BUT
Line_6307	VOLUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY SHORT THAT'S WHAT I SAY ON THE PICTURE
Line_6308	CAPACITY IS HIKER THAN THE VOLIOUM
Line_6309	THE MOST IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE THE ERASE HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_6310	MEASURED MASS THE CAPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLUME
Line_6311	THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_6312	THE TOOLS OR THE UNIT SIDE
Line_6313	EVERY TEN MILLA- LITERS
Line_6314	YOU COULD USE CIRVINCHES AND JU MEASURE THAT IT'S PROBABLY THE S
Line_6315	YOU COULD USE THE SORENGE AND STUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD PULL IT OUT
Line_6316	IT SUCKS UP WATER AND THEN SIT OUT WHEN YOU PUT POLE SUCKS IN PUSH S
Line_6317	IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY MILLI
Line_6318	YOU COULD SCORDEND INTO A BEER BEAKER NOT A BEER
Line_6319	COULD FOLLOW IT UHM THE BEAKER
Line_6320	UH BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE S RANGE WILL'T EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE
Line_6321	YOU COULD FIGURE OUT I I FORGET WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
Line_6322	OH YOU'RE WELCOME GOOD BYE
Line_6323	WELL WE HAD
Line_6324	CAPACITY IS THE MEASUREMENT HOW LONG SOME THE CA CAPACITY
Line_6325	HOW MUCH WATER SOMETHING IS AND THIS PEEK TRAY HAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLIMETERS IT'S JUST A FAST PITION
Line_6326	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6327	HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN THE CUP
Line_6328	WE TOOK SODA CANS TO SEE IF THE SODA COMPANY TOLD THE TRIP ABOUT IT OR DIDN'T NOT TELL THE TRIP ABOUT IT
Line_6329	AND WE DIDN'T FILL OUR CANS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP BECAUSE THE UM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS FILTONTHEWAY TO THE TOP SO YOU SHAKE THE CAUSE YOU SHAKE THIS BEFORE YOU OPEN IT
Line_6330	WE USED WE LEFT A LITTLE SPACE INSIDE AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER IT READ OUT HOW MUCH WATER THAT WAS
Line_6331	MEANS THAT THERE'S THREE A HUNDRED OUT THE MELLITERS
Line_6332	IT COULD I WILL ACTUALLY HURT ALMORE THAN IT SAYS BECAUSE IT
Line_6333	I I'M NOT SOR
Line_6334	OHH THE CAPACITY HAS
Line_6335	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS
Line_6336	RENGES ON THE FAR LEFT AND THE MIDDLE THERE IS A GRADUATED SILINDER AND ON THE SIDE IS ONE LITER
Line_6337	MEASURE THINGS OR WATER FOR COOKING
Line_6338	UM WHAT WE DO FOR MEASURING OF THINGS TOOLS WE YOU SE HITCH TALL
Line_6339	Y YOU JUST READ HOW MUCH
Line_6340	HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS IN ALL THE CRANGES PUT TOGETHER
Line_6341	THE UNIT WE USED OUR MELLOLITEMELLOLITERS UH LITERS
Line_6342	YOU WOULD MEASURE HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAS
Line_6343	NEED OTHER TO MEASURE CAPACITY ORANGES AND ALWAYS THE BEST TALKS THAT COULD STUCK UP THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_6344	YOU LOOKED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TURTLE
Line_6345	YOU COULD SENSE THAT IT WAS COOLED
Line_6346	A THERMOMETER BECAUSE THERMOMETER IS CONLLUTIVE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_6347	IT MEASURES SOMETHING AND THE THING THAT A THE MOUNT OR MEASURES IS TEMPERATURE CELCIES DEGREES OR FAIR IN HIGH DEGREES
Line_6348	THE THIRD AND FIRST CUPS ARE HOTTER THAN THE SECOND AND THE FIRST CUP
Line_6349	GETS SWAMMER
Line_6350	WE TOOK THE ICED WATER AND
Line_6351	IT'S FIFTY DEGREES SOUTH SO IT'S WARMER THAN THE WATER ON THE LEFT WHICH IS TEN DEGREES YES
Line_6352	TELLS YOU THAT THE WATER IS WARMER THAN THE TEMPERATURE CUPS THE LITTLE WATER
Line_6353	THE WATER THIS MARKED TENDEGAR IS SALT YES TENDEGAR SALTS YES
Line_6354	IT'S NEXT BYE MARNEY
Line_6355	UM THE ILLUM AND IN CEL SEE A SCREEN
Line_6356	WELL I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT COLDER AND U
Line_6357	THEY HAVE BEEN THAT UM THE FIRST HIGH
Line_6358	ARNIE THE LOUD AND THEY GOT ALLY COLD AND WE COULD WEREN'T L TO PUT A HAND IN WHICH WAS SAT BECAUSE WE WERE HOT
Line_6359	IT GETS IT STAYS THE SAME AND THEN GET WHAT GET AND
Line_6360	WELL IT STARTED REALLY HIGH AND THEN IT GOT COLDER AND COLDER
Line_6361	THE LITTLE RED LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE BLUD GOES DOWN T
Line_6362	GOOD STONE UM SNOW IT STOOD I HI
Line_6363	WELL IT'S GETTING COLDER AND CLIPS
Line_6364	IT TAKES MORE SPACE AND STARTS TO BRAN
Line_6365	I DISPLAYED IT WAS ON A LINE
Line_6366	I DREW WITH LITTLE DOTS ON A IN GRAM
Line_6367	L THERE WAS THAT UP GO I
Line_6368	WEL- IT HELPS YOU
Line_6369	IN ERS A TILE AND THAT'S NOT MEAN AND YEAH
Line_6370	I PUT THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MINUTES OF HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN
Line_6371	THE DOTS ARE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND THEN THE DOTS SHOW IT MOVING DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND WHAT EVER
Line_6372	TWENTY DEGREES S
Line_6373	YOU IS SEEN HOW MANY MINUTES I'VE BEEN BETWEEN TWENTY MS ER OUT
Line_6374	UM E MOCHEAH
Line_6375	STARTING THE FIRST NUMBER BUNS ENDING AT THE LAST NUMBER
Line_6376	WE STARTED UP AND IT AT TWENTY IT'S FIFTEEN
Line_6377	I MEAN IF IT'S TIRE OR
Line_6378	THE FIRST TWO ARE BELOW CITY AND THE SECOND TWO ARE OVER F
Line_6379	THAT'S THE FIRST YOU ARE LOWER THAN FIFTY AND THE SECOND
Line_6380	UH MY NAME SERIES
Line_6381	WHAT WE A MAR SIMPLY IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MONKEY
Line_6382	TO MEASURE THINGS AND ALSO SOME AND DO STICK THAT LITTLE LONGER THEN YOU STICK
Line_6383	YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS AND IT'S MAINLY ABOUT T HOW LONG IT IS
Line_6384	SO WE PUT ONE STRAW IN FRONT OF ANOTHER STRAP ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS TABLE TO FIBER OUT HOW LONG THE TABLE WAS
Line_6385	WE WORKON IS IN THIS STRAWS
Line_6386	T THINK THAT THE DIFFERENT SIZE DOSE SOMETIMES
Line_6387	WE HAD DIFFERENT LENGTH STRAWS TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENT UH IT COULD LOOK LIKE I THINK
Line_6388	IT WAS SEVEN STRAWS FOR GROUP C
Line_6389	THERE'S THE SAME FOUR THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS
Line_6390	YOU NEED TO USE THE SAME SIZES
Line_6391	IT MEANS KILOMETERS
Line_6392	AND UH MOST EVERY BY THE M THE ENTIRE WORLD
Line_6393	SO WE AS TO MADE IT AND MEAN AND THE PINKIE'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT
Line_6394	HOUSE THEM TO I'M NOT SURE
Line_6395	BECAUSE THAT SHOWS US BECAUSE THEY SHARE YOU NUMBERS AND IT SEESER SO YOU KNOW
Line_6396	IS THERE IN SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT HELPS YOU MEASURE
Line_6397	THEY'RE ALL SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT S
Line_6398	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT SIZES HAVE THINGS AND IT A SCIENTIFIC WAY AND LENGTH AND WAS
Line_6399	THERE IS ONE BENCH IN THE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
Line_6400	YOUR PINKIE OR OUR HANDED OR FOOT
Line_6401	THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
Line_6402	WELL IT SEEMS KIND UH LIKE YOU U
Line_6403	MEASURING IT E YOUR PINKIE OR WITH YOUR HAND OR FEET OR PART OF YOUR BODY BY MEASURING IT THAT WAY
Line_6404	WELL IF THE HAND IS FIVE INCHES TALL UP I MEAN TEN INCHES LONG SO THEN THE SIDE WILL BE ABOUT
Line_6405	WELL THE WHIT BOARDS ESTIMATE WOULD PROBABLY BE WA RULERS LONG WHICH WOULD BE
Line_6406	WELL IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING A TON OF TIMES YOU'RE PROBABLY WHEN THAT TIME'S GOING TO GET THE RIGHT ESTIMATES SO IT HELPS YOU
Line_6407	GETTING BETTER AT ESTIMATING BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU GET BETTER AND GET THE CLOSER AT
Line_6408	TO YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6409	AT A HORSE FRANCE YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE CARRYING MEASURING PAPER BUT IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG YOUR HORSE WAS YOU'D PROBABLY NEED ESTIMATES
Line_6410	USE A MEASURING TAPE OR USE YOUR AN OR RUFFRUM
Line_6411	IT HELPS YOU FINGERS OUT HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6412	BECAUSE METER TAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND HANDS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6413	I I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_6414	IT SHOWS YOU THAT IF YOU BEGIN AT ONE ENDS END AN END AT THE OTHER
Line_6415	GETTING AT END OF THE TABLE
Line_6416	IT FELT KIND OF HUND BECAUSE NOBODY HAD THE EXACT RIGHT WEIGH TO MEASURE FROM TIGHT
Line_6417	WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIXED OUT THE CLOSEST GUESS WE COULD GET TO WITH A FRIEND
Line_6418	WE NEEDED TO LEARN THE CRAFT CABINET N EXCEPT THE TEACHER RECOMMENDED
Line_6419	S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN IF THE ANSWER THE SAME ANSWER TWICE THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT CORRECT ANSWERS
Line_6420	WAS A LITTLE HIGH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE SAME RESULT THAT IT CAME OUT LOT DIFFERENTLY
Line_6421	METER TAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY BRAKE THE METERS TO IT AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO ME
Line_6422	LIKE THE CHECK WAS BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING RE
Line_6423	OOD HAS THE SAME SIZE AS ONE KILOMETER
Line_6424	IT GIVES US RERUM TO DO STUFF BECAUSE IT CAN AND FISH SO IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL
Line_6425	E WASN'T REALLY ANY BODY PART MEASUREMENTS THAT WERE THE SAME COULD WE DON'T GET TO FINISH MEASURING BEFORE WE LEFT FOR THIS
Line_6426	THE LIGHT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FLEW ARE
Line_6427	ARE BUT OTHERS ARE NOW BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BODY PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME THAT'S EVERY BODY PARTS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_6428	YOU PROBABLY YEAS THE REFERENCE THE PINKIE HAS TWO INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_6429	YOU USE THE SMALLEST NA I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED
Line_6430	I GUESS I THINK IT KIND OF BECAUSE LIKE SOME THING I'M NOT YOUR
Line_6431	YOU WILL PLEASE THEM WHEN LOGS AND A METLE STICK OH WHEN YOU'RE ENABLED TO MEASURE SOMETHING
Line_6432	WE'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MASS TODAY AND MISSES HINE'S CLASS
Line_6433	THEN WE MEASURED THE MASS AND ESTIMATED THAT WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND WITH A STEEL TIE
Line_6434	EASEL STEEL TO FIGURE THE WEIGHT
Line_6435	FOUND IT MAKES IT'S
Line_6436	WELL YOU COULD USE DIFFERENT REFERENCES TO MEASURE THE M
Line_6437	IT'S A PAPER CLIP
Line_6438	GROUP TWO HAD A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND GROUP ONE HAS A SMALLER PAPER CLIP
Line_6439	YOU COULD HAVE THE UM WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOU COULD HAVE THIS THE SAME SIZE INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6440	GROUP TWO HAS SMALLER RESULTS GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER RESULTS
Line_6441	THAT'S ONE GRAM WE LOVE S FOR MAGNING HOW MUCH STUFF WEIGHED
Line_6442	WE MEASURED THE THINGS WE IS JUST SCIENT
Line_6443	MOVES YOU UM ARE EXACT ANSWER
Line_6444	I KNOW THAT IT WEIGHS MORE THAN A SMALL ONES BECAUSE OF THE SIZE A MASS
Line_6445	THE LARGE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_6446	WELL THE S THE MIDDLE DISK IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY GRAMS THERE ARE
Line_6447	IT'S IN A PERFECTLY STRAIT LINE
Line_6448	WELL I'M NOT REALLY OBSERVED WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT
Line_6449	AN BECAUSE WE'RE MASTERING WITH GRAMS
Line_6450	ONE GRAM A FIVE ONE GRAM FIVE IT MA TELLS YOU
Line_6451	WHERE BEING IS TO MEASURE THE MASS OF THE PIECE OF WOOD
Line_6452	CAN S ALL RIGHT THE PENCIL IS TWO NICLARS THAT MUST NAME ITS TEN GRAMS
Line_6453	A METAL DISC WEIGHS GRAMS
Line_6454	THE TOY CAR WEIGHS SEVENTY GRAMS
Line_6455	TWENTY BLUE
Line_6456	IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IT'S SO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MATTER BUN
Line_6457	THE ORANGE WEIGHS MORE THAN ALL THE GRAM PIECES AND THE CUPS
Line_6458	WELL OUR THEATRE HAD US TAKE IN SCIENCE TO DAY SHE HAD US TAKE
Line_6459	THE ORANGE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_6460	IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND A LETTER SIDE IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS TWO
Line_6461	A KELLOGRAM IS TEN OF ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6462	YOU YOU NEED TO USE A SCAIL B
Line_6463	TWO THREE AND EIGHT
Line_6464	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORK TO DAY WE WORKED WITH A SPONGE AND WATER
Line_6465	SPONGE ON THE LEFT WAS DRY THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE SWEAT AND THE SPONGE ON THE RIGHT WAS SOAKED AND THEY GREW AS THEY GOT WET AND DREW DRY
Line_6466	WELL IT'S A SPONGE THAT IS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TOO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET
Line_6467	IT'S A WET SPONGE WHICH MEANS IT HASN'T GO ON ALL THE WAY TO SOAK A SOAKED SPONGE BUT IT IS STILL GETTING BIG IS STILL BIGGER THAN
Line_6468	IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOTALLY WET AND IT'S YOU IT'S DRIPPING AND REALLY WET
Line_6469	WHEN IT'S ALL THE IT WHEN IT'S LARGEST IT CAN GET A
Line_6470	YOU CAN TAKE THE WET SPONGE YOU CAN EARS SPONGE AN ERS GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6471	THERE IS NO GRAMS AND THE CAN I NEED TO PUT GRAMS AND THE CUP UM
Line_6472	YOU USES GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6473	SPUNCH IS FOUR THREE GRAMS LONG
Line_6474	E SPONGE WEIGHS THREE GRAMS TILL UNIFORM
Line_6475	IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_6476	IT'S SIXTEEN GRAMS LONG IT'S SIX TEEN GRAMS AND IT WEIGHTS
Line_6477	YOU CAN UM IT YOU CAN MEASURE THE DIFFERENT S
Line_6478	SO YOU MEASURED THE MOUTH OUT AND THE ANSWERS CARCHING GRAMS WATER BECAUSE YOU TOOK THREE AWAY
Line_6479	ITS CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_6480	YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENT
Line_6481	H I WOULD PROBB LE OU ONE PART AT A TIME
Line_6482	WELL IT SORT OF TELLS ME THAT I CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS
Line_6483	AD MANLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT AND THE CUP
Line_6484	YOU GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME ARE BECAUSE THE GROUP ONE IS BIGGER AND GROUP TWO IS SMALL
Line_6485	IT'S A PICK TUREAVLITOR
Line_6486	WELL WE CAN MEASURE DIFFERENT WATERS A MOUSE OF WATERS OUT
Line_6487	OR A SHOWING HOW MUCH WATER IS TO THE CUP
Line_6488	S SO THAT WE CAN UM
Line_6489	WITH THE LITTLE SPINNERS ONE NO METER IT'S THING IT W ONE HUNDRED AND MELMETERS
Line_6490	A ONE HUNDRED
Line_6491	I USED THEM AND COOK GAINS
Line_6492	IT'S FOR VALIUS WHICH IS EIGHTY AT GROUP ON IS FOR WHICH IS EIGHTY MELLIMETERS AND
Line_6493	STUFF THE STUFF THAT WE MADE TO MANY
Line_6494	I'M NOT SURE
Line_6495	UM MILLIMETERS I
Line_6496	IT'S PUSHING THE WATER AND THE SIDES TRIAL OUT THE FRONT
Line_6497	YOU WOULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND MORE HOW MANY IT WAS
Line_6498	THEY WRAPREZENT DIRENTMUMBERSFOR MILLIMETERS I
Line_6499	I SHARED WATER
Line_6500	THAT WAS ABOUT UM OKAY
Line_6501	ATER A B SANDY THROUGH THAT ASORB D
Line_6502	WELL THE SALT OF THE
Line_6503	A SPRON CURRENT OR WHATEVER LITTLE SCOARY THINGS COULD
Line_6504	THEY TELL YOU TO THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS AND YOU CALL THIS CONVERSATION
Line_6505	ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN SO EACH ONE WA
Line_6506	EACH LINE REPRESENTED TWO IT DIDN'T HAVE THE DARKER LINES THAT THEY
Line_6507	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6508	THIS IS TH MAXIMUM THAT'S HALF OF ONE HUNDRED
Line_6509	I'M LO
Line_6510	ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GALOMS Y
Line_6511	ELL CALL THE BACK AND SEE WHAT THE VOLUME SAYS
Line_6512	HOW MUCH THERE WAS FROM THE BOTTOM LIME BEAM
Line_6513	EACH ONE IS FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_6514	THE VOLIUMEMABPLESS AND THE CAP
Line_6515	YOU COULD MEASURE UP THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_6516	TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER ARE FILLED WITH THE S SLOPE
Line_6517	THERE CONTAINERS
Line_6518	A HUNDRED MALLITERS
Line_6519	THEY ARE DIFFERENT SENCES BUT THEY'S THE SAND OTHER WIRE'S
Line_6520	IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED MILLIMETERS OF WATER TO T DO IT
Line_6521	THAT THE SHAPE AND THE VOLUME ARE ALWAYS THE SAME THE VOLUME AND TYPE DON'T MATTER BUT THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER DUST
Line_6522	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT UM MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_6523	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A CIROFICE UM BLOCKING IT THEY STILL CAN STICK
Line_6524	I CAN RELAXES THE LAND
Line_6525	WELL ON THE THICKER PAPER IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK BUT ON THE THINNER PAPER IT'S THIN SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_6526	I DON'T KNOW
Line_6527	WE THE LONG SI OBJECT IS A NAIL AND SO UM WHEN THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6528	I'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6529	WE WERE UM WE ARE DOING A MEASURING AND YEAH THAT'S STUFF
Line_6530	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6531	YES UH MAINLY IT WAS THE WASHER
Line_6532	WHAT HOW LIGHT THE MOLECUES ARE MOLECULES ARE SORRY
Line_6533	NO WE USED A SCALE
Line_6534	COUNTERWAITS OR THINGS THAT MAKE OTHER THINGS ON A SCALE EVEN LIKE STRIP LIKE STRAT SIDE TO SIDES
Line_6535	DON'T KNOW YOU'RE WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6536	BECAUSE METAL WEIGHS MORE THAN PLASTIC U
Line_6537	IT WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_6538	BALANCER BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT RIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_6539	YES IF IT'S ON A SAIL
Line_6540	THE PLASTIC CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS ARE ON A SCAIL AND CUPS AND THE EQUAL
Line_6541	WE'VE BEEN DOING THE VISION AND WEIGHT
Line_6542	E PLASTIC CHIP THEN THE WOODEN CUB THEN THE METAL RING
Line_6543	OR TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
Line_6544	THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_6545	THAT'S MALL I THINK
Line_6546	UM YOU COULD UM GOOD IT'S UM OR RAY I N UM UM ESTIMATE
Line_6547	TWENTY AND THAT'S YOU'RE I THINK THAT'S IT
Line_6548	UM IT'S HOW MUCH THEY ARE IN SLCIES
Line_6549	UM BECAUSE WHEN IF YOU DO IT WHILE IT'S STILL MOVING YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERATURES
Line_6550	HE PLACE IT UNDER WATER TO AND THEN THE ALCOHOL CUP GOES UP OR DOWN
Line_6551	OW UM HOW MUCH HOW HOT OR COLD HOW HOT OR COLD THEY ARE IN SULCIES
Line_6552	UM WE HAVE BEEN UM MEASURING VOLUME UM AND WEIGHTS YEAH
Line_6553	MARNEY I DON'T GET THAT
Line_6554	AND THEN AND THE GRAMS WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SPONGE WOULD
Line_6555	I IT THINKS THANKS FOR LETTING ME TEACH YOU BYE MARNEY
Line_6556	OH NEAT TODAY WE MEASURED HOW MUCH WATER A SPUNCH CAN TAKE UP
Line_6557	WE USED GRAMS BECAUSE
Line_6558	I I THINK THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT
Line_6559	THE METAL DISC WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6560	UM YEAH THAT'S SPACICCILEE YEAH
Line_6561	YEAH WE HAD THAT IN OUR CLASS AND THEN WE USED THE MOUTH
Line_6562	WELL THOSE LITTLE NUMBERS ON THIS SIDE AND YOU READ THE TEMPERATURE THERE
Line_6563	ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IS
Line_6564	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER AND UM S STUFF LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6565	GRAM ARE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND
Line_6566	YOU YOU COMPARE IT WITH THE NICKEL
Line_6567	UM WHAT WHAT STUFF ER WHAT STUFF EQUAL
Line_6568	AND- AND TEN GRAMS EQUALS ONE TEN BIG GRAM
Line_6569	YOU FIRST PUT IN THE ORANGES AND THEN YOU
Line_6570	THE ORANGE WEIGHS A LOT MORE THAN THOSE GRAM S
Line_6571	FIVE TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS S
Line_6572	UM WHICH ONE WAS HOTTER AND WHICH FORM WAS COLDER
Line_6573	THE ROBY IS STICKING HIS FINGERS IN CUP B TO SEE IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_6574	IT MEANS THAT A IS UM IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM TH SEE AND SEE IS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM BEAT
Line_6575	WHICH ONE IS HOTTER
Line_6576	UM YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE UM THE TEMPERATURE OR YOU COULD DISCUSE YOUR FINGER
Line_6577	YOU STICK A THERMOMETER AND UM THEN IF Y THEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS
Line_6578	E WANT TO USE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_6579	M I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_6580	YOU WOULD LOOK UP CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT TEMPERATURE IT WAS
Line_6581	ON SOME IT'S REALLY HOT AND ON SOME IT'S REALLY COLD
Line_6582	THE THERMOMETER IS S
Line_6583	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE WORD FOR IT
Line_6584	IT'S THE OLCOHOL
Line_6585	THE THE ICE WATER I MEAN THE MICE IT MOUNTS IN THE WATER AND THEN IT MAKES IT AND THEN THE ICE MAKES IT COLDER
Line_6586	AND IT'S GETTING COLDER
Line_6587	WE'VE BEEN DOING S LIKE WEIGHING THINGS
Line_6588	WE PUT IT IN ONE SIDE OF THE SCALE AND THEN WE WAITED TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS BY PUTTING GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER SIDE
Line_6589	AND YOU CAN ADD MORE GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED OR TAKE OUT GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_6590	WELL IT TAKES LIKE THE DISCS THE METAL DISC IS BALANCED WITH THE GRAM WEIGHTS
Line_6591	WELL YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF DIFFERENT WELL YOU CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LOT OF IT
Line_6592	BINGS YOU CAN WATER AND EAR AR IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE EASIEST ONES AND THE ONLY ONE'S THAT WE'VE DONE
Line_6593	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS A HOTTEST AND WHICH WAS COLDEST AND WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6594	HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURES OF THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_6595	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THEM SOME OF THE CUP ARE GOING TO BE COLDER THAN OTHERS
Line_6596	BIT
Line_6597	WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT WANTS TO EXPAND IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS HOT ER
Line_6598	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6599	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURES LENGTH CAPCILYS AND MASSES
Line_6600	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOURS OR HOW COLD IT IS
Line_6601	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS THE COURSE AND RICH THE MEDIAM AND RICH WAS THE HARDEST I MEAN WARMEST
Line_6602	WELL A IS INITING ONE OF HIS FINGERS INTO THE CUP B
Line_6603	OW FIRST IT WAS A PRETTY THE GRID THEN A DROP THE FIVE TIGERS THEN EVENTUALLY RUN UP
Line_6604	WELL WE UM SIBATIONS ARE
Line_6605	WELL OBSERVATION THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS UM MAKE GRASS AND CHOP ABOUT THE THINGS AND YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT
Line_6606	I LIKE SCIENCE ILL MUCH AND SCIENCE IS MY FAVERET LEARNING SUBJECT
Line_6607	HUNDRED UH ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IS BOILING POINT SO THE WATER WILL BE BOILING
Line_6608	OILING IS BUILT WE HAD
Line_6609	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPONGES CAN OBSORB
Line_6610	THE THE LEFT ONE IS DRY THE MIDDLE ONE IS WET AND THE RIGHT ONE IS SOCKET
Line_6611	ITS ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER
Line_6612	IT'S SORT OF CRACKLES
Line_6613	IT'S WET SO IT MOVE IT'S WET SO IT MOVES MORE EASILY AND IT'S OBSORBEDN SOME WATER
Line_6614	SPONGE HAS GOTTEN BIGGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS HARD
Line_6615	THE WATER DRIPS OUT AND IT GETS IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
Line_6616	WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITHOUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET
Line_6617	THE SPONGE HAS OBSORBED WATER AND SO IT'S TIPPING THE BALANCE SAIL
Line_6618	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE E
Line_6619	THE SPONGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE IT'S ORBSORBING WATER
Line_6620	GRAMS WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONGE AND IT WAS EQUAL
Line_6621	WE HAVE MEASURED TEMPERATURE
Line_6622	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT OR HOW COLD THINGS ARE AND YOU CAN USE THERMOMETERS TO TELL
Line_6623	WHICH WAS THE COLDEST AND WHICH WAS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6624	AS AND IF IT WAS THE COLDEST OR THE WARMEST
Line_6625	THE ROBOT IS TESTING CUP BE WITH HIS FINGER
Line_6626	IT MEANS THAT SOME HAVE HIGHER DEGREES THAN OTHERS AND THIS ROBOT IS TRYING TO TELL
Line_6627	WHICH ONE IS COLDEST T WARMEST AND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6628	AND LIQUIDS AND SOME SOLIDS AND MOST GASSES
Line_6629	MEASURED THE EXACT DEGREES AND HOW DIFFERENT ALL THE CLASSIC MEASUREMENTS WERE
Line_6630	IT SHOWS HOW MANY DEGREES THAT THE THING IT'S ON ARE
Line_6631	THEY SHOW HOW MANY DEGREES THE THING THAT THEY'RE ON IS
Line_6632	WE CAN DO CELCY S OR FAR IN HEIGHT THESE THERMOMETERS SHOW CELSIUS
Line_6633	WE WERE CHECKING THE CHANGES AND TEMPERATURE EVERY MINUTE
Line_6634	WE NOTICED SORT OF A AT THE SAME DEGREES AND IT'S SORT OF ROSE AFTER A FEW MINUTES SLOWLY
Line_6635	THE ICE SCOOPS WILL MELT AND THE WATER WILL GET WARMER
Line_6636	IT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE ICE CUBE IS FROSEN WATER SO IT'S COLD
Line_6637	I SEE FIFTEEN DEGREES ON DIFFERANTS
Line_6638	N RIGHT IT DOUBT OF COURSE OR
Line_6639	I SEE THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN I LA A LOUD A LOUD AND THEN SLOWLY GOING UPWARD
Line_6640	M KIND OF JUST SOAKED UP ALL THE WATER THAT IT CAN HOLD
Line_6641	MEAN IT'S KIND OF BEEN JUST SOAKING UP WATER
Line_6642	UM THE ON
Line_6643	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A TOP SPUNGE IS
Line_6644	THANKS MY DEAR BYE
Line_6645	UM MATH UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6646	WE MEASURED HOW WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND WE SAW HOW COLD IT WAS
Line_6647	WE MEASURED HOW COLD IT WAS WITH THE THERMOMETER AND THE BEAK WAS COLDEST
Line_6648	H HOW COLD AND HOW HOT IT WAS
Line_6649	OKAY WE WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD WITH I WEIGHT WITH THE WEIGHT LAST WEEK
Line_6650	WE COULD USE A RULER AND MEASURE HOW THI IT WENT UP TO
Line_6651	IT COULD TELL US HOW HIT THE CUP THE CUP COULD HOLD WATER
Line_6652	GA THE VOLUME OF LIQUID AND THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN
Line_6653	H HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_6654	E VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND THE CAPACITY THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD BUT THE VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IT'S HOLDING NOW
Line_6655	I WOULD FILL IT UP TO THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6656	WE COULD USE TO CIRRANGE AND MEASURE HOW MUCH
Line_6657	WE COULD USE A CIRRANGE TO MEASURE IT
Line_6658	I DID THING'S

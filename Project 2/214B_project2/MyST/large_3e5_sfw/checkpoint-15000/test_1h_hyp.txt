Line_2	IT COARS A SISTOM WITH THE MANY PARTS LIKE THE WEAEL
Line_3	THE CARE HAS MADPARTS LIKE THE ZAUS
Line_4	THE MANY PARTS IT HAS
Line_5	DEL HEHELPS IT ROLE
Line_6	HUMAN BODDY IS ALSO I
Line_7	IT SHOWES ME PART OF PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND WHAT MAKES IT A
Line_8	UH W ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE HEART CONNECTS TO AND THE BLOD VESIL
Line_9	ALL THE PARTS THAT MAKE IT A SYSTOM
Line_10	THE ERTH IS ALSO
Line_11	IT IT HAS LAND IT ALSO HAS WATER AND IT HAS BEFOR STEELS
Line_12	YES BECCAUSE ERTH HAS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE UP
Line_13	WELL THE TREESE ARE PART THE
Line_14	SAND AND PLEACES LIKE
Line_15	THE BY SFEER IS PART OF ERTH AND ERTH IS AN NEGO CYSTAL
Line_16	THIS PICTURE SHOWES ME A MAYBE A SHOW TLAP AND LIFE
Line_17	WHAT ANIMALES EAT AND WHAT ANIMALS GET EATEN BYE ANIMALS ARE PART OF THE B
Line_18	A PINE TREE AND PRODUCES ITS FOED
Line_19	ABOUT D COMPOSEORS CONSUMARS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE UFRIC DILIY PRODUCES
Line_20	THIS SHOWS UST CONSUMARS PRODUCERS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_21	COMPOSERS CONCUNARS AND PRODUCERS
Line_22	WHEN THEY EAT THE FRUD THE ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_23	COUSUMARS EAT OTHER ANIMALES AND CONSUMARS CAN GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_24	IT CONSUMAR THAT EATCH ANOTHER ANIMAL OR A CONSUMAR THAT THE ANIMAL GO TO EAT AM BYE MAYBE
Line_25	THE RABAT WILL THEY BOTH CIND OF EAT LIKE PLANTS AND THEY BOTH GET EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
Line_26	THEY ARE BOTH ANIMALS RIGHT

Line_32	CAN YOU PLEASE NAME ALL SOAORE
Line_33	RED WORMS EATH DECAY METARAL
Line_34	THEY ARE CAMPING OWN THE PAPER AND LEAVES AND TURNING IT INTO THE THAT MEANS THEY ARE DCOMPOSING
Line_35	IT TURNES INTO DIRTS HOR SOIL
Line_36	THE WAICE IS THE WORMS FOOD
Line_37	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT UP THE GROTH OF PLANTS
Line_38	SOMETHING WITH GORALS
Line_39	WELLE IT'RE ONLY W GDHAN'T THER MONS ACD

Line_54	NO BECAUSE PLANS ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WILL NOT HAVE SELTER BUT THEY MOSTLY DO NEAND THIS
Line_55	PLEASE REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_56	BY THEIR BLOODS CELLS AND THERE ARE LEAVES
Line_57	THE FOOD THEY B THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH THE LIGHTS FROM THE SUON AND THE ENERGY
Line_58	IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY OF THIS STUFF THEN IT A GARANTEEDED IND A DODGE
Line_59	PRODUCING THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_60	IT'S DNERING IT'S
Line_61	IT'S NOT GETTING THE WRIGHT MATERIALS THAT IT NEADS TO LIVE
Line_62	IT MEANS IT'S GETTING NO FOOD AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY FOOD IT'S NOT GOING TO LIVE

Line_68	THEN THAT MEANS IT'S GETTING ALL THE THINGS THAT IT MEANS
Line_69	THAT FUE WEBS ARE IMPORTANT TO LIFE
Line_70	THAT FLAMS ARE IN
Line_71	IT STARTS WITH THE DCOMPOSERS THEN TO THE PRODUCERS THEN TO THE CONSUMARS
Line_72	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT AVS PLANTS LIVING THINGS AND HOW PLANTS NEED AIR SUN AND WATER

Line_135	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING CISTUMS
Line_136	MY BODY AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE SOCASE MEANING ONE BECAUSE THE SOTCASE HAAD A TUNT OF LITTLE THINGS THAT MADE UP THE STCASE
Line_137	I THINK THERE IS BARONING VERY MANY PARTS OF THE ENJEN THAT'S MOVING AND MAKING THE ENTIRE CARD WORK
Line_138	I THINK IT'S LIKE A SUBSISTM AND A SUSISTOM IS A LITTLE SISTOM THAT MAKES UP A BIG SISTOM
Line_139	I THINK IT'S A SISTOM BECAUSE THERE IS TUNS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MOVE AND STOP
Line_140	IT SHOWS UM HOW THAT T'S ONE THING THA HELPS YOUR BODY

Line_155	DIRT WATER AND THE SUNLIGHT
Line_156	ANE TRENTS FROM THE SOIL
Line_157	I THINK PLANTS NEED THE SUN
Line_158	NO I DON'T THINK IT REALLY WOUOLD
Line_159	PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FEAED THEM
Line_160	I THINK THAT'S TOMATO JEWS
Line_161	THINK I DON'T THINK THEY NEEDED BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_162	YES THEY DO NEAN THAT
Line_163	THE SUN MAKES IT LOOK GREEN AND IF IT DOESN'T GET ANY SUN IT WON'T BE GREE

Line_166	SMIGCE AND HELTHY AND IT GET'S FREE TO GROW
Line_167	IT'S WHAT EATS W AND WHAT EATS IT
Line_168	PRODUCERS ARE USUALLY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FOODWEAB WHICH MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT EATS IT
Line_169	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE VASCULAR SISTOM AND PLANTS AND VASCULAR MEANS SPAINS
Line_170	SOME LEAVES ARE ADIFFERENT PLANTS AND SOME AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THEIR RANGE TO BE GOING
Line_171	PENNEI POLMATE AND PARALLEL
Line_172	WELL WE HAVE MAINS OR ANIMALS
Line_173	THE BASCULAR SISTM IT IT CARRIES ALL THE FOOD AND NEW TRANS ANDW
Line_174	I THINK IT COMES FROM THE LEAF BECAUSE IT EVAPORATES
Line_175	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAIN BODY AND THE RESPRETORY SISTA
Line_176	IT WARNS ANIMALS TO STA AWAY OR THEY CAN BE SPRAYED
Line_177	THE CARAIDY DOESN'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE NEARE THE SCLCHS IT'S TAIL IS UP AND THAT MEANS IT MINDS BREIGHT

Line_414	THAT THERE TO BE ANYWEARE
Line_415	THAT THEY THEY ALL HAVE SELLS AND SOME THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_416	I THINK THA HUMAN HAS THE MOST SCELLS BECAUSE THE HUMAN IS BIGGER
Line_417	WELL THIS IS AN INSECT BUT IT CAN IT'S ALSO AN AND WON'T D IT ALSO AS SELS
Line_418	THIS KIND OF ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A HUMAN BODY
Line_419	THAT THERE'S SOVIVA HAS TO BRAKE GOUM AF FULD
Line_420	THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODDY
Line_421	TO MAKE SURE WE STAY HELTHY AND DON'T GET ANYTHING BAD IN OUR BODDY
Line_422	IT BRAKES IT DOWN SO WE DON'T CHOK
Line_423	IT WILL TAK OUT ALL THE BAD STUFF AND IT 'ILL BREAK THINGS DOWN
Line_424	THAT IT HAS A SIRVIV WHICH CAN BRIK YOUR FOOD DOWN AND MIXTURE THAT YOU DON'T SHOW
Line_425	THAT THE SPLIGE THAT BREAKES IT DOWN
Line_426	IT BRINGS YOUR FOE DOWN
Line_427	THAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR FOOD GOES DOWN TOYOUR STUMMICK
Line_428	IT HELPS YOU SWALLOW DOWN THE FOOD AND
Line_429	THAT'S WHERE ALRIAL FOOD GOES
Line_430	THEY ALSO HOLPE YOU DIJEST YOUR FOOD
Line_431	ABOUT LIKE THE DIFFERENT TIPES OF LEAVES AND LIKE THE DIFFERENT NAMES AND ABOUT THE ROUTS AIN THE LEAVES
Line_432	THAT THERE IS A PINEY A POLMAY AND A PARALLEL
Line_433	ALL THE ROUTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEIR SHAPE IS DIFFERENT
Line_434	THERE IS THREE KINDS OF VANS THERE IS PALMEC PIONNE AND PARALLEL
Line_435	ABOUT THE DIJESTIVE SISTUM AND HOW YOUR FOOD DIJESTS AND HOW YOU BREETH
Line_436	YOU'RE A SOFFIGIS IND YOUR MOUTH
Line_437	THEY ALL HELP YOU LIKE DO JUST YOUR FOD
Line_438	THE LGNE SNOWS NOWTH BRONHI DIEFRAM
Line_439	BECAUSE IF YOU COULDN'T BREETH YOU WOULDN'T BE ALIVE AND
Line_440	THAT THIS IS LIKE HOW IT GOES THROUGH
Line_441	IT GETS THE BREATHING FOR ANY HUMANS
Line_442	THEY HELP YOU LIKE PUMP AIR OUT OF YOUR SISTOM AND THEN BACK GAIN
Line_443	THAT LIKE IT'S LIKE THA LONG BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPING YOU PUMP AIR AND PUMP IT OUT
Line_444	BRONE CUT BROUNCLES
Line_445	UM HELPING PUMP THE AIR AND YOUR LUNGS AND UT OU
Line_446	THET IT GETS REID OF ALL O THE BAD AIR
Line_447	IM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_448	ABOUT LIKE UM LIKE  LUNS AND HOW WE BREETH
Line_449	IT WELL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW ANIMALS LIKE USE ATTRACTIONS TO CALL MATES OR SENCE DANGER
Line_450	THAT THEY ALL CALL FOR MATES AND SHENCE DANGER AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW AND THEY TRY NO GET AWAY FROM PADLERS AND YEAH
Line_451	WELL THE SCEONC WILL USE ITS SMELL BECAUSE IT STINKS LIKE REALLY THAT IT WILL USE IT SMELL TO MAKE PREDTORS GO AWAY
Line_452	IT IS LIKE ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS THAT IT BLUNS IN WITH THE SAND SO IF ONE OF ITS PLEARS COME BY IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
Line_453	WELL IT LIKE COULD BLEND IN TO THE CORAL
Line_454	THE THA ITS FEAT HIS LITTLE TINY LITTLE CUTE LITTLE FEET
Line_455	BECAUSE AS LIKE THEA RIGHT KIND OF WEB KIND OF AND LIKE IT IT'S REALLY LIKE IT HELPS IT PUSH
Line_456	NUMBER TWO DYS BECAUSE THEY'RE CANIGNE TEETH AND THEY REALLY SHARP AND HELPS THEM LIKE CHO IT UP
Line_457	I THINK THAT IT'S UM WEAINS DO SO IT COULD FLY AWAY
Line_458	BECAUSE LIKE THERE SHOW BRIGHT AND THEY HTHERWINGS IT CAN HELP IT FLI AWAY FROM PRELARS
Line_459	WELL SHE'S LIKE LIKE THE SNAKE IS WARNING THE GIRL WITH HIS WRATTAL
Line_460	WELL SO THE HUMAN DOESN'T GET HERT HE IS JUST GIVING HER A SIMPLE WARM
Line_461	WELL THE SNAKE IS THE STIMMUIS AND THE GIRL IS THE REACTION
Line_462	WELL THE THE SCUNC IS LIKE MAKING HIS SMELL SO THE CIOTY WILL GO AWAY FROM
Line_463	THAT HIS SMELL HIS LIKE SCUN SMELL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY STINKY
Line_464	IT COULD HAVE  REALLY WEARED REACTION
Line_465	'S ABOUT STIMULAS AND IT'S MOSTLLY ABOUT ACTUALLY LIKE REACTIONS AND STUFF
Line_466	THAT TI'LL SHOW A STIMULS AND AND REACTION I RE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_467	THEY ARE LIKE MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET COLD ON WHERE THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY ARE
Line_468	INSTINK TOUAL BEHAVIERE
Line_469	WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THEYRE'S SEING LIKE THO WAY CAL I JUST GOT THAT ON SPEEKER OH MAKEA
Line_470	NO IT ISN'T A LEARND BEHAVIORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A REACTION
Line_471	YES YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO RIGHT BECAUSE IF 'S NOT INSTINKTIVE IT'S A LEARNING THING
Line_472	WE'VE BEEN DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS
Line_473	SALAD IS MIXED WITH VECHTABLES
Line_474	THEY ARE MIXED WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS
Line_475	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT
Line_476	IT TAKES BETTER WHEN IT'S MIXED
Line_477	THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_478	THE MARBLES ARE STUCK IN THE THING YOE HAD THE WATER W AND THE BULB
Line_479	FOR THE SCREEN THE SAND FALLS ON THE SCREEN SO THEN THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
Line_480	THE SAND IS NOT GOING THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_481	UM IT I CANN'T FORGOT I'M SORY
Line_482	THE SALT EVAPORATES OR OR DISSOLVES
Line_483	UM MAYBE I YE DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_484	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT EVAPORATES THE WATER STILL SI STUGS AS SALT WATER
Line_485	IT'S TURNING INTO A MIXTURE BUT SALT DISSOLVES AND IF IT WER HADD SAND IN IT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO THE WATER AND THE SCRE
Line_486	SALT OR THE SOLUTION
Line_487	YES YOU COULD PUT THE GREAP JSE BACK IN THE CAN BUT UM THE WATER WOULD JUS THE GREA  WOULD BE PURIFIED WITH WATER
Line_488	UM
Line_489	THERE IS MUD MADE FROM SAND AND WATER
Line_490	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU SAID YOU NT KNOW THE SOME COMING
Line_491	IT DISSOLVVES
Line_492	I LIKE TALKORS
Line_493	WELL IT IS A SIUTE I DON'T KNOW WHTHAR SIUTE IS SO PLEASED THEMIT WOLTH A SIGE H OCKAY
Line_494	WHAT IS A SILUTE
Line_495	WHAT IS A SIUTES
Line_496	SALT SALT SALT INTERMELIKE
Line_497	TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU A REAL PERSON OR IT'S THY'S JUST LIKE AN ANIMATED ROBAR
Line_498	UM THE SOLUTION
Line_499	CAN YOU PLEASE ANSWER ME I DON'T KNOW
Line_500	REPEAT THAT
Line_501	IT IS PERFECTLY BALANCED
Line_502	WE HAVE NOT YET LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE CLASS BECAUSE WE'V JUST STARTED THE UNIT
Line_503	OF A MIXTURE IN SOLUTION SPRAE
Line_504	WE HAVE NOT LEARNED AT SIUNTE MEANS YET SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT A SIUNTE MEANS YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT HUT FOR ME PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A SIUNTE IS
Line_505	IT MEANS THAT IT CREATES SOLUTION AT THE END BECAUSE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SALT INTO THE CUP
Line_506	A SOLUTION
Line_507	A MIXTURE A MIXTURE A MIXTURE
Line_508	IT'S A MIXTURE NOW BUT THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH SO DOESN'T IT CREATE A SOLUTION
Line_509	IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_510	A SOLUTION
Line_511	A MIXTURE
Line_512	U I DONT MILLK
Line_513	IT IS CREATING A MIXTURE
Line_514	THEY TURN INTO CRYSTALS
Line_515	IT IS THE TURN TO CRYSTALS LIKE SALT CRYSTALS I THINK SO THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_516	CREATE A MIXTURE
Line_517	UM THE PERSON WAS MIXING IT UP
Line_518	UM I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
Line_519	UM I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TIME IT TAKES TIM FOR TO EVAPORATE
Line_520	UP TO DAY WE TOOK SALT CRYSTALS MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_521	BYE
Line_522	MIXTURES
Line_523	SOLUTIONSA
Line_524	USING A SCREEN AND OR A MAGNET OR A FUNNEL
Line_525	WHAT DID YOU SAY MNE
Line_526	WHAT DID YOU SY MULME
Line_527	WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT THE MIXTURES MARNEY
Line_528	I THINK A LITTLE IMPORTAIMPROPERTY OF THIS PICTURE IS MASS
Line_529	YUS IT IS A MAGNET IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_530	I WON'T ASK RE A QUESTION MARNEY
Line_531	OKS LIKE THE SAME EXAMPLE TO ME THE SODIT SEAMS LIKE NAGTIVES
Line_532	BECAUSE SOE MIXTURES ARE TIPE OF GASSIS SOME ARE SOLID AND SOME ARE LIQUIDS
Line_533	UM I THINK IT'S THE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THILS HAVE METAL IN IT AND MAGNET'S ATTRACTING METAL
Line_534	MARNEY WOOD IS UM LI WEGLES
Line_535	UM I THINK IT IT COULD BE SALT
Line_536	UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS PLEASE TON MY WHITH THE MEN
Line_537	A SOLUTION
Line_538	UM BYE CHIKING TOACH
Line_539	NOT GOOD NOT GOOD AMOUNT DOING SIRVWALTER DAY
Line_540	WE UM WHAT ARE WE DO IN SCIENCE
Line_541	HER IS THAT MOLD ON THE RIGHT CUP I DON'T KNOW THAT IT LECTUALLY GROWS
Line_542	I'M JUST JUST SAYING IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ARAN
Line_543	THE ROCK WEIGHS EITY TWO MORE N OWH I MEAN TO USHING THE ROCK WEIGHS UM EITY EIGHT MORE GRAMS THAN THE FETHER
Line_544	WHAT IS I WHAT IS A SOLUTE
Line_545	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHS HEAVIER
Line_546	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_547	U MOST CONCENTRATE IS SOLUTION TWO
Line_548	OH THAT WON'T BOOKS SLIGHTLY ONE NOT
Line_549	THE MOST DILUTED LOOKS LIKE A SOLUTION THREE
Line_550	UH GOOD BYE WHAT'S OUR NAME AGAIN
Line_551	NOT GOOD I'M NOT DOING SO WELL TO DAY
Line_552	I DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WAIGH'S MONDAY AND LAST TIME EDEN SCIENCE WAS EITHER ON FRIDAY OR THIRSDAY SO I CAN'T REMEMBER
Line_553	IT LOOKS LIKE A CORK SLOWLY ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND THE PENY HAS SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND THE WATER
Line_554	UH THEY FLOW AND SOME DON'T FLOW
Line_555	DON'T LAID D CUTLLIYDIUED
Line_556	A SOLUTION B HAS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS IT UP LIKE SALT CAUESE SALT CAN KEEP THINGS UP
Line_557	UM YEAH ISA I EGREE
Line_558	IT'S IT'S U
Line_559	IT AN COMES FIFTY YEAH IT BECOMES A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND
Line_560	M THE BLUE ONE IS MORE DENSE SO IT FLOWS ON TOP OF THE YELLOW LIQUID
Line_561	UM IT'S VERY CONSONTRATE
Line_562	IT HAS TE MOST GRAMS OF SALT
Line_563	THE BLUE ONE HAS THE MOST GRAMS AND THAT MAKES IT MORE DUN
Line_564	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE DENSE AND ONE IS WESS ANSE THE LESS DENCE ONE IS THE GREEN AND THE MORE DENE ONE IS
Line_565	HI HOW YOU'RE DOING TO DAY
Line_566	UH IT'S ABOUT SALT AND WATER
Line_567	YEAH BIE
Line_568	EI NOTICE THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED EVERY TIM
Line_569	UM SO IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATIG NOW BECAUSE IT'S THREE SCOOP OF
Line_570	E IS  SO THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE
Line_571	IT'S NO CONCENTRATED EVERY TIME
Line_572	I DON'T KNOW THAT ANO
Line_573	ARE YOURE GOING TO ANSWER ME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING AND I ARE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SO
Line_574	I CNAME UP A CERTIMAM CONDRUCTWATE
Line_575	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT TWOULD BE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS IN THE WASHER
Line_576	ATHE ONE IN THE MIDDLE WOULD BE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_577	H THE ONE IN THE MIDDL IS THET MOST THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST GRAMS INSIDE OF THECAM
Line_578	UH BELIEVE IT WOULD BE WELLDAMSCON
Line_579	UM IT LORKS LIKE THE SUBSTANCE TO IS THE MOST CONSCIANT
Line_580	THE ONE ON THE MIDDL SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST CO
Line_581	UH IT TALKS LIKE SUBST
Line_582	UH UP STE THREE
Line_583	UM THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES AND DIFFERENT UM UH DIFFERENCES LIKE LIKE UM O YOU CAN DESCRIBE THEM DIFFEREN
Line_584	UM THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THEG
Line_585	IT WOULD BE AM EPSOM SALT
Line_586	WAS BC EPOM SALT IT MUST BE
Line_587	WE DID A SCIENCE UM A A CUPLE DAYSE AGO SO I FOR I FORGOT UM
Line_588	THEY'RE MAKING CAML REACTION AND MAKING IT EXPLOTE ITXPLOWED
Line_589	ACHEMICAL REACTION
Line_590	OH IT'S THE PRODUCT
Line_591	UMREPEATE
Line_592	UM I THINK THE BEST ONE WOULD BEA THE CALCIM CORN BEA
Line_593	NEMBERED
Line_594	UM IT BECOMES THE PRODUCT
Line_595	IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CEMICALES IN IT
Line_596	UM THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENTUM C
Line_597	THOE MOUNT MOLECUELES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_598	UH I I DON'T KNOW
Line_599	THEY  LIKE THEY'RE DIFFERENT MOLECULES
Line_600	MIX  PRODUCT OR A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_601	UM THERE ARE CHEMICALS CALLED BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLOR
Line_602	ONLY IT BUBBLES UP
Line_603	THE PRICIY PITAPE GOES TO THE BOTTM
Line_604	THE SODIUM HIGHT DROPS SIDE IT DISSOLVES
Line_605	THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIPES OF MOLECULES AND ALL
Line_606	UM IT JUST DISSOLVES
Line_607	M IT DISSOLVES LIKE OUR HEEPS
Line_608	UM I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME UM AFTER THE CHEMICALS ARE PUT IN SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN
Line_609	UH IT'S MADE BUBBL
Line_610	UHUH I DON'T THINK THE THEMICALS WATER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WOULD BE WATER ON THE OUT SID
Line_611	IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MAM A NEW CAMAKL
Line_612	HERE SOMEONE IS DUMPING WATER INTO A GLASS
Line_613	UM ITSTHENS
Line_614	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION FCUREN
Line_615	CAUSE IS RUS
Line_616	THE TWO WITH GREEN LIQUID MADE THE WATER TUR IN GRA
Line_617	IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE BENDING A GLOW STICK THAT'S A
Line_618	UM THERE'S CM REACTION TAKING PLAC
Line_619	UH YEAH TOTALLY
Line_620	UH I WONT NAO SEE THAT BIDDYGOB
Line_621	H YOU'RE ADDING THE GRAPES TASTICK INTO THE WATER AND IT MAKES IT BE A DIFFERENT CON
Line_622	YES THERE ISI THINK
Line_623	TO DAY WE LEARND ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS HOW THEY MIXD TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_624	I'M DOING WELL TO DAY MARYGOOD
Line_625	UH IT IS IMPORTAN WHEN YOU SAY IMPORTANT DO MEAN PORTIN TO THE ERTH OR LIKE TO THE EXPERIMENT
Line_626	I NOTICE THAT IT UM BLUE UP SO I THINK IT MADE OCIGIN
Line_627	I THINK THOSE CHEMICALS ARE CREATENG CREATING OCCIGIN  HIDRGEN BUT WE WOULDN'T PLEASING A
Line_628	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_629	IT LOKS LIKE UM IT GETS HEAVIER WHEN YOU UM ADD MORE CHEMICAL ST
Line_630	ELL TWENTY FIVE PUS THIRTY FIVE BECLES SIXTY AND SIXTY GRAMS
Line_631	UM I HINT WEIGHT  I DON'T KNOW THAT
Line_632	THEY ARE NOT TEQUAL TO EACH OTHER
Line_633	M I THER'S MORENEAED TO SAY I AGREED WITH YOU OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I'M DOING GOOD
Line_635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_636	THEY ARE ALL TWO OR MORE THINGS THAT ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_637	SOME ARE FOD AND SOME ARE OTHER ITUMS
Line_638	HALF OF THEM ARE FOOD AND HALF OF THEM ARE OTHER MIXTURES
Line_639	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE AND THEN ONE ON RIGHT AR A BUNCH OF SEPARATE ITUMS
Line_640	IT IS A MIXTURE AND WHEN WE DO IT IT WILL MAKE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
Line_641	I WOLL CALL THESE MIXTURES
Line_642	IT GETS SORED IT OUT INTO THREE DIFFERENT ITUMS AND THEN IT IS NOT A MIXTURE
Line_643	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED AND NOW ARE NOT A MIXTURE THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT ITUMS
Line_644	THE MIXTURE IS BEING SEPARATED
Line_645	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND CREATED A SOLUTION
Line_646	I DON'T KNOW
Line_647	A SOLUTION
Line_648	MARNEY I CAN SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_649	MARIA CAN'T SEE THE VIDIO
Line_650	KNO MARNEY I DON'T KNOW THEM
Line_651	MARNEY I CANT SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_652	A SOLUTE
Line_653	THAT NOTHING EVAPORATES OR DISAPPEARES
Line_654	THAT NOTHING DISAPPEARES OR EVAPORATES INTO THE AIRA
Line_655	BY EVAPORATING THE LIQUID AND JUST LEAVING THE SOLID
Line_656	ONLY IN A MIXTUREAM NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_657	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER ALL THE WAY SO IT WAS ABLE TO BE SEPARATED
Line_658	THIS MEANS THAT TOH THE WATER AND THE SALT ARE THE SOLUTE  ARE A SOLUTION
Line_659	THAT MEANS THAT ITWAS A MIXTURE NOT A SOLUTION
Line_660	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ASID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER MEANING THAT IT WAS A SOLUTION
Line_661	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE LIQUID TO ETO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_662	IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE WATER TO EVAPORATE AND LEAVE THE SALT BE
Line_663	GOOD BYE BU MARNEY
Line_664	I'M DOING EXLENT AND THAT GREAYT SLEEP LAST NIGHT
Line_665	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_666	YOU CAN SORT IT OUT WITH YOUR HAN
Line_667	YOU CAN USE A FUNNEL OR A SCREEN
Line_668	THERE IS A DRY MIXTURE AND A MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF IT
Line_669	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WROCKS AND THE WATER
Line_670	WHAT'S A SEEDE
Line_671	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND I THINK THE SAND
Line_672	THE MAGNET PULLED THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_673	A SEEVE AND A MAGNET
Line_674	BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE ROCKS AND THE WATER SO A SEE CATCH THE ROCKS ON TOP WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE WHOLEDS
Line_675	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE METAL IN THEM AND SOME MIXTURES HAVE BIG OBJECTS AND SMALL OBJECTS IN THEM
Line_676	BECAUSE THE MAGNET WOULD GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT AND LEAVE THE REST IN THERE
Line_677	I NOTICE THAT ONLY THE ROCKS WENT THROUGH THE SEE NON OF THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY WARE TWO SMALL
Line_678	UN CLEASED FILTER BECAUSE IT'S HOLDS ARE BIG ENOUGH THAT WATER CAN GO THROUGH BUT SMALL ENOUGH THAT SAND CAN NOT
Line_679	BY MARNEY SEE YOU WHENEVER I SEE YOU AS OF LIKE THE NEXT TIME WE DO AN EXSCIENCE EXPERIMENT TO GETHER
Line_680	A SOLUTE HAHION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_681	I THINK IT'S CALLED SOMETHING LIKE A SOUTE TATION OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_682	CAUSE ITWLL ITHER BE DARKER OR LIGHTER
Line_683	ONE ONLY HAS TWO PURPLE CRYSTAL SHAS AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRYSTAL SHARTS
Line_684	ONE OF THEM HAS TWO CRISTALS OF POWDER AND THE OTHER HAS FIVE CRISTALS OF POWDER
Line_685	I THINK THAT THIS IS TRYING TO SHOW THATTHE MORE DILUTE THE LIGHTER AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED THE DARKER
Line_686	THERE IS MORE GRAPE RINK POWDER AND THE DARKER ONE AND LESS GREAP DRINK POWDER AND THE LE
Line_687	WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY ADDING WATER TO IT
Line_688	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER OR NOT PUT AS MUCH WAER INTO STO
Line_689	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER
Line_690	YOU CAN WEIGH EACH OF THEM IF YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AND SEE WHICH ONE WEINHS MORE AND THAT ONE IS OST CONCENTRATED
Line_691	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT WEIGHED MORE THAN TWO AND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE TWO WEIGH MORE THAN ONE
Line_692	BY MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME WE DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
Line_693	IT WILL FLOW
Line_694	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWT BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE ALSO
Line_695	THE ONE THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW AND THE ONE THAT IS MORE DENSE WILL SINK
Line_696	THE ONE THAT IS MORE CONCENTRATED WILL SINK AND THE ONE THAT IS LESS CONCENTRATED WILL FLOW
Line_697	IT WILL FLOWT INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_698	REAN
Line_699	BECAUSE THE DENSER ONE CEPT THE LIGHTER ONE WEIGHT DOWN AND ENDED UP MIXING WITH IT
Line_700	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION S ARE FLOWTING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF MIXING
Line_701	BY MARNEY I CAN WEIT TO DO MY NEXT EXPERIMENT WITH YOU
Line_702	OM GREY HOW ARE YOU
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT IS A SATURATED SOLUTO
Line_704	WE NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN DISSOLVE IN WATER OF COURSE WATER AND SOMETHING TO PUT THIS SOLID INTO THE WATER WITH
Line_705	WE PUT IN SEVERAL SCOOPS OF SALT UNTILL THE WIRE COULDN'T HOLD ANYMORE SALTIN IT SO IT WAS SATURATED
Line_706	UM THERE IS SO MUCH SALT AND THE WATER THAT THE WATER CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE
Line_707	AFTER THREE SCOOPS IT IT BTHE WATER BECAME SATURATED AND THE EPSOM SALT WENT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_708	IT'S TAKING A LOT LONGER TO BECOME SATURATED
Line_709	IT LETS THE REST OF IT STINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE SHIGER IS ADDING  YOU CAN AD
Line_710	THE SHI TOOK LONGER TO B R TO SATURATE THE  THAN CITRIC ACID
Line_711	THE WATER IS RIZING AS WE PUT IN MORE SALT
Line_712	I DON'T KNOW
Line_713	UM DOING THOOD READY FOR SCIENCE HOWABOUT YOU
Line_714	WHEN YOU MIXED THE VINEGAR AND THE BAKING SODA IT STARTED FILING UP
Line_715	WE ARE GOING TO MIX MORE ONE OF MORE THAN ONE OF THESE WITH WATER
Line_716	REACTOINS AND PRODUCTS
Line_717	VINEGAR OR TH WATER
Line_718	THEY LOOK DIFFERENT SO THEY CHEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_719	THE REACTIND MOLECULES WHEN MIXED CEMICALLY CHANGED
Line_720	BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORRIDE AND WATER
Line_721	THERE UM TWO PURPLE MOLECULES AND AIT LOUNT OF STEL WATER MOLECULES
Line_722	NO BECAUSE THEY HAVE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND BASICALLY CREATED ONE U SUBSTANCE
Line_723	THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FILZING UP
Line_724	THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE CARBONATED WATER STARTED FILLING UP WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO THE CUP
Line_725	THE GREN SUBSTANCE WENT INTO THE WATER AND TURNED ALL THE WATER GREN
Line_726	I THEANK TA CHEMICAL REACTION IS ACCURRENT BECAUSE THE WATER IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE DRING SUBSTANCE
Line_727	THE SUBSTANCE ON THE INCETTHEIR GLOW STICKS TOSCIGL
Line_728	THE WATER CHEMICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THE GRAPES THAT I THE CA STICK IS MIXED WITH IT
Line_729	NO BECAUSE THE GRATVES THE TAY STICK IS JUST GOING INTO THE WATER ANOT WERLLY CEMICALB CHANGE I
Line_730	BYE I HOPE TO SEE YOU NILATER WHEN I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MORE SCIENCE
Line_731	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_732	I SEE IT'S CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER FOR THE REACTAN TO CREATE A NEW SUBSTIE
Line_733	I SAW A NEW PRODUCT AT THE BOTTOM
Line_734	THEY MADE IT FIL UP AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOME
Line_735	IND THAT THERE WAS A CEMICAL CHANGE
Line_736	THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOST
Line_737	THAT NO WEIHT IS LOSTD
Line_738	THE BAG THAT WAS OPEN LET OUT THE GASS THAT IS CREEATED AND THE BAG THAT WIS CLOSED CEPT THE GUASS AND MAKING IT WEIGH MORE
Line_739	THE OPEN BAG IS LOWER OR ITS A WEIGHS LESS THAN THE CLOSED BAG
Line_740	BECAUSE THE OPEN BAG LEFT OUT R LET THE GASS GO OUT AND THE CAUS BACK DIDN'T
Line_741	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
Line_742	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_743	THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS IN THEM
Line_744	THES HAS THE SALAD
Line_745	IT HAS EVERY THING IN IT THAT MAKES IT A MIKESE
Line_746	IT IS CALLED A MIXURE WHEN ONE OR MORE ME TWO OR MORE THINGS ARE COMPARED TO
Line_747	A MIXTURE
Line_748	IT IS NOT COMPARED AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALLTOGETHER IT IS COLED
Line_749	THEY WERE TOOKING OUT OF THEIR M
Line_750	THEY WERE TOOKEN OUT OF THEIR MIXTURE AND NOT KEPD TOGETHER ANYMO
Line_751	THEY WERE TOOKING OUT OF THEIR MIXTURES AND NOT KEPED TOGETHE
Line_752	WHEN TRYING TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE SCREEN THEY WERE NOT PUT IN BECAUSE THEY ARE TO BI
Line_753	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE FROM THE WATER
Line_754	SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE SAND AND WASHE
Line_755	THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER INTO A MIXTURE AND THEN SEPARATE
Line_756	IT BECAME A MIXTURE AND THEN WAS SEPARATED
Line_757	WHEN IT DISSOLVES IT BECOMES PART OF THE OTHER MIXTURE INT CREATES ONE BIG SOLID
Line_758	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_759	MORE ROLS THAT THEY HAVE BIN CREATING THE SOLUTION IS WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE DISSOLVE
Line_760	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_761	THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WAS DISSOLVED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THE SALT WAS TOOKEN BY THE WATER AND DIS SAL
Line_762	A DISSOLVATIONO
Line_763	NO I DO NOT THINK SO BECAUSE IF AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE AND DOS
Line_764	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SALT AND WATER BEING MIXTURES AND D
Line_765	THAT WHEN YOU MIXKE SAND AND WATER TOGETHER IT JUST MIKES BROWN MUDY WATER AND HEN YOU MIXKES SALT AND WATER TOGETHER IT MAKES A CLEAR SOLID AND LIQUID
Line_766	WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SALT IS THAT WHEN THE SAND AND WATER WERE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE IT WAS DISSOLVED
Line_767	I THINK THAT THE WATER AND THE SOLUTION IS PLAYING THE LIQUID BECAUSE THE GRAP ASTICK IS A SOLID
Line_768	I THINK THAT IT IS CALLED A DISSOLVENT
Line_769	I THINK THE SOLUTE IS THE SALTS IN THITS MIXTURE AND ITS POSITION IS THE SOLID IN THIS PAP
Line_770	WE CALL THE THING THAT IS THE DISSOLVING U DISSOLVENT
Line_771	THE MASS OF THE STUFF GOING IN D GRM
Line_772	THE MASS IS CREATING A LARGER AMOUNT BECAUSE OF MORE MIXTURE IS BEING BROUGHT INTO
Line_773	MARNEY THIS DOESN'T MAKE
Line_774	WHAT IS THE CHERM ARMEY
Line_775	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PIXCTURE
Line_776	WHAT'S UP THIS REPET
Line_777	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND IT BECAME A MIXTURE SOLUTION
Line_778	WHAT IS THIS OBJECT MORNING
Line_779	MARNEYN I CAN NOT SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_780	WELL MORNEY THE WATER IS DISSAPEARING FROM EACH DISH BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING THE SALT IS SHRINKING IN TO THE WATER
Line_781	MORNEY WHAT IS DICIPATING MEAN
Line_782	MORNEYN CAN USE SUMAN ON THE PIXCTURE PLEASED
Line_783	MARNEY CAN WE GO OVER THIS HOLE CHESTGAT
Line_784	YOUR TWO MARNEY HAVE A GOOD DAY YOU'RE MY BEST FRE
Line_785	ONE WAY WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE IS USING A SCREEN ANOTHER IS TAKING A FUNNEL
Line_786	A MIXTURE IS A MIX  SOMETHING OF TWO OR MORE OBJECTS MIX TOGETHER MAKING A COMBONATO
Line_787	THE OBJECT AND WATER IS BEING SEPARATED FROM WITH FROM THAE SCREE
Line_788	MOARNEY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MISS
Line_789	MONEY WHAT IS A PROPERTY
Line_790	WE WHENT ABOUT USING A MAGNET IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAGNET USES MAGNETISM TO GET THE MAGNETS O
Line_791	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PIXTURE
Line_792	MARNEY I CAN NOT SEE THE PIXCTURE
Line_793	WHAT IS A THEEVE
Line_794	BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM WOULDN'T BE AS STRONG
Line_795	I THINK WE WUSE DIFFERENT TOLS ROM DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE IT HELPS FOR DIFFERENT PRO
Line_796	I THINK WE YUSED A MAGNET BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAN ON MAN'T BE ABLE TO S
Line_797	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL SEPARATED FROM FROM THE SAND BECAUSE IT IS A BIGGER OBJECT OBJECT AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE WHOLES
Line_798	I THINK WE USED A FILTER SO THAT THE WATER COULD GO THROUGH AND THE SAND DID NOT
Line_799	YEARES YEA
Line_800	I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT EVERY THING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WENT ON AND SEPARATING THEM THROUGH THE MIXE
Line_801	MY BEST FRIND BY MARNEY MARNEY CAN YOU KEEPE TALKING TO ME
Line_802	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DILUTIN AND CONCITERATE LIQUIDS THAT HAVE BEEN MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_803	WELL TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MIXTURE AND THEN SOME HOW SEPARATE THE MIXTURE
Line_804	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE DILUTED
Line_805	THAT THEY ARE MORE DILUTED
Line_806	BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER AS THE CONCENTRATED ONES
Line_807	IT WOULD TAST NOT AS STRONG YET A LITTLEMORE DILUTED IND
Line_808	BY ADDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER
Line_809	BY ADDING MORE WATER TO A DIFFERENT CUP
Line_810	BECAUSE YOU COULD ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THEN DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_811	THE AND THE PURPLE AND THE BLOUEM ONE CUP IS CONCENTRATED AND ONE IS DILUTED
Line_812	I CAN SEE THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO CUPS OF SALT WATER I SOLUTION THAT ONE HAS TEN GRAMS F SOLUTE AND THE OTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SALT
Line_813	THE ONE OF TWETY GRAMS SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE THING GRAMSO BECAUSE IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS
Line_814	MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_815	BECAUSE OF THE TWENYGRAMS AND THE TEN GRAMS A SOLUTE BEING COMPARED WILL BE THE TWENY GRAMS BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IS TEN MOR GRAMS SO
Line_816	I THINK WE HAVE TO DOUWITH THE AMOUNT THE MASS AND SOLUTE IS THAT THE MASS IS GREATER AND EXPERIMENT THAN THIS
Line_817	SOLUTION THEONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_818	SOLUTION THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED A SOLUTION ONE
Line_819	SOLUTION ONE MAS SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATING SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRA
Line_820	SOLUTION THREE SOLUTION ONE IS THAT MOST GOME STRAT INTO THE SOLUTION THREE THE LEAST CONFORT
Line_821	SOLUTION A FIRST SOLUTIN
Line_822	IF SOMETHING IS MORE DANSI WE DROP INTO THE CHINK IT ILL FLOW ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_823	I THINK THIS MEANS A SOLUTION B HAS SALT IN IT SOLUTION A DOES NOT
Line_824	WELL IT WOULD DEPEND ON IF IT HAS SALTAR NA
Line_825	THEY DID NOT BLAN THEY DID NOT BLAN AND THEY DO NOT BLUN
Line_826	I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT SINCE THEY'RE NOT BLENDING IT'S CAUSING A FORM OF CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION
Line_827	IT WOULD NOT BLENT AND IT WOULD LOOK CONSCT FROM CONCENTRATED TO DILUTION
Line_828	NOT BLENDING
Line_829	SOME ONE EITHER ADDED TO M PRESURE OR YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EACH
Line_830	IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF TEN GRAMS OF SALT
Line_831	I NOTICED THAT BLUE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IT AND THEN RED IS A LITTLE MORE DILUTED AND THEN GREENIS
Line_832	THAT THE BLUE HAS TWELOGRAM SO THIS THE HEAVIEST SO THIS THEMOST CONCENTRATED AND THEN RED IS THE SECOND CONCENTRATED AND THEN GREAN IS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_833	BECAUSE THE BLUE WAS THE HEAVIEST AND GREAN IS THE LIGHT
Line_834	ELLOWE CORNDL
Line_835	IT'S EVEN MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THE FORE SCOOPS IS MORE AND THE THREE SCOOPS MAKES IT MORE
Line_836	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN DILU
Line_837	WELL IT DID NOT DISSOLVE ALL THE WEIGHT
Line_838	W I THINK VEGLES AND TWO THIRTY SIX FORTY EIGHT TWELVE SLIHIN SEPSANC THREE IS THE TWENTIEST ONE AND THEN UM THIRETY SIX I MEAN SOME THIC'S ONE AN AND SAE
Line_839	THE SUBSTANCE TWO IS THE MOST LEADING AND
Line_840	THE CRIYSTALS GO AWAY
Line_841	WELL THE CRYSTALS WOULD NOT MAKE CLEAR
Line_842	WELL THEY GO IN CLEARLY TO THE DITCH AND DON'T COME OUT
Line_843	ULT CRYSTALS WOULD BE THE MOST UM DENITY
Line_844	HE WAED THE AND
Line_845	WELL EVAPORATED TOGETHER AND MAKING AM IT ALL MIXTURE THE REAL PRODUCTION
Line_846	HIT IS A PRODUCT CANEBYE W TE GREE
Line_847	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_848	IT MAKES IT A SALT CRYSTAL WIGHTTHERE'S A STARDAD OUT OH
Line_849	PRICIPITATION IS HAPPENING AND ITR MAKES ITS MOICING AND MA SATURATE THE SOLVENTS IN TO PRICIPIT
Line_850	AND THEN YOU MAKE THE PARCIPITATION GO
Line_851	ORERN SCIENDS WELL IT HANDS OVER AND IT MAKES PATICIPITATION
Line_852	WELL AS YOU SHAKE IN MOISCING THE BAG THE PERSON'S HAND IT'S MAKING FRDCIPITATE MORE
Line_853	THE CHEMICAL ACTION CURED BECAUSE THE PROTIPITATION HAPPENED AND IT WENT DOWN TH CHAN
Line_854	THE MAGNET IS BRINGING THE PAPER CLIP RIVERGO
Line_855	THE MAGNET IS MOVING AROUND AND THE THE PAPER CLIP IS STICKING
Line_856	IT'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_857	MAGNETS
Line_858	WHEN I WENT UP TO NINETEENE IT STOPEDT IT WENT DOWN
Line_859	THE WHEN I WENT UP TO NIGNETEEN AGAIN THE THE MAGNETS WERE ATTRACTING AT FIRST BUT THEN ITSTOD OF REPELLING
Line_860	IT GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER AND STRONGER BECAUSE THETS MORE WASHERS THAN THE MAGNET
Line_861	IT GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER EACH TIME YOU ADD SOMETHING
Line_862	WHEN I UED THE WASHER IT GOT SEPARTHE MAGNETS SEPARATED FROM ME
Line_863	I'S JUST LOINE ADDING AND ADDING AND ADDIN
Line_864	ENORTH AND SOUTH CAN CAN BE TOGETHER AND SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH TO
Line_865	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LECTRI
Line_866	WELL YOU YOUPUT THE BATTERY TO THE WITH THE BATTERY
Line_867	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_868	THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_869	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE IT IS FLOWING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND COMING BACK AROUND AND AROUND
Line_870	MOTOR IS MOVING IT TO MAKE THE ENERGY S COMING BACK AGAIN
Line_871	BECAUSE MEAEN METAL TO TOUCH TO FOR ENERGY TO TO WORK FOR ENY OTHER ENERGY
Line_872	IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE THE ENERGY IS TRAPED
Line_873	FOR THE SWITCH TO CLOSED
Line_874	NOTHINGS ATBEEEN
Line_875	FOR THE FOR THE SWITCHER TO TURN TO CLOSED
Line_876	IT DOESN'T WORK THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_877	THE SUNLIGHT IS MAKING IT'S LIKE A CALCULATOR MAKING IT WORK BY THE SUN
Line_878	WET HAVPEN FOR THE MOMENT TO RUN IT'S TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SO IT CAN WORK
Line_879	FOR THE SUNLIGHT TO SHINE ON THE THING
Line_880	OR THE SON FOR HIS SUN FOR THE MOTOR TO WORK SO HE CAN WORK
Line_881	IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_882	NO MEAN NO
Line_883	IT TURNS THE MOTOR ON
Line_884	IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT FOR THE ENERGY TO WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_885	THE SUN MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_886	THAT'S NOT MOVING ANY MORE
Line_887	THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR ANY MORE
Line_888	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING IS THE BATTERY MAKEING THE MOTOR RUN BECAUSE THE D CELL T'S FROM THE WIRE
Line_889	THINK YOEU A LOT
Line_890	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_891	WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN SCIENCE IT'S ENERGY
Line_892	THE NAIL IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_893	UM
Line_894	A CONDUCTOR MAKES ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_895	IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POPSICAL STICK
Line_896	NATIVE IS PLASTIC SO
Line_897	THAT ELECTRICITY IS ENERGY
Line_898	UM BECAUSE CONDUCTING IS NOT FLOWING
Line_899	IT'S NOT SPINNING STILL
Line_900	I NOTICE ABOUT THE PAPER CLIP THAT IS MAKING THE ENERGY FULLOW
Line_901	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_902	WE WERE WE'VE BEEN DOING MAKING TWO LIGHT BULBS TO WORK AT CAM T
Line_903	ER  IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRODUCES LIGHT
Line_904	I SEE A CANDLE PRODUCIN HEAT ENERGY
Line_905	IT GETS IT COMES WAX OFF WAX IT COMES OFF AND THE IT HAS TO HEAT FOR HEAT IN IT
Line_906	IT MAKES IT'S BECAUSE IS THE HEAT
Line_907	THE WAX
Line_908	NO END O
Line_909	IT'S SOUNDED LIKE NOTHING
Line_910	I SEE THE WAX MELTING AND THE FIRE BERNING
Line_911	IT  IT HAS A COLOR THAT WE CAN SEE
Line_912	BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_913	IT PRODUCES SOUND ENERGY
Line_914	YOU CAN HEARE THE SOUND WHEN THE STICK IS BANGING ON THE SRUB
Line_915	GIRL IS WALKING UP A MOUNT IN
Line_916	HEN REPEETE THAT
Line_917	BY EANING THE HELTHY SNACK LIKE AN APPLE OR BNANOS OR GREAYPE
Line_918	I SEE A FIEWELE BLOCKS A BRANCH CANDLE APPLES AND A CABINET
Line_919	IT'S HEAVING UP TO TURN TO FIRE
Line_920	IT IS MAKING IT MOVES
Line_921	IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_922	UM IT IT'S MAKING IT PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_923	I DON'T KNOW
Line_924	S THE SOWR PANEL CAN MAIKE STUFF MOVE AND THE ONE THING YOU CAN MAIKE STUFF MOVE TWO
Line_925	THAT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_926	ENERGY U
Line_927	IMPORTANT BYE MAKES STUFF IN THE MOVEME
Line_928	BILDING CIRCUITS CAORS  NO I DON'T KNOW
Line_929	IT MAKES WEL HOW IT HING TO DAY
Line_930	HAVE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_931	CIRCUIT S ABOUT CHANGED THE FON
Line_932	THE BATTERY IS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_933	SO THEY CAN ALL LIGHT UP SO IT CAN MAKE ALL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_934	UM IT'S MAKING IT WLIGHES UP BY A LIGHT BULB I MEAN THATERY EXPOIN
Line_935	UM THE D CELLS ARE GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS TO WORK
Line_936	THOSE ARE D CELLS THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB PWORK
Line_937	BYE MAKING THE TWO LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_938	IT'S TO FLOW THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_939	BY CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_940	GI GOT THAT
Line_941	THREE THERE ARE THREE PATHWAYS IN THEM
Line_942	SAY WELL NOT WOR BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ONE BATTERY AND THERE'S LIKE FIFTEEN OF THEM LIKE BULBS
Line_943	UM THAT ILL MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTER
Line_944	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WEILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_945	UM BECAUSE THERES THE TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER OH NO
Line_946	UM THE BULBS MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS WORK TO CREE ENERGY
Line_947	THAT THEY ARE NOT WORKINGS
Line_948	ENERGY
Line_949	IT HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_950	THE BOTH LIGHT BULBARE LIGHTING
Line_951	THE BATTERY IS MAKING TWO BULBS WORK
Line_952	THE BULBS ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_953	UM IT'LL GET MORE BRIGHTER
Line_954	I DON'T KNOW
Line_955	ELECTRICITY COMES FROM A BATTERY
Line_956	THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY GOING AROUND AND AROUND IT FROM THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_957	THE MINER OF THE IN THIS PIXTURE IS THE BATTERY MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_958	THAT THEY ARE GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_959	THE BATTERYE S MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS WORK
Line_960	THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SIDE
Line_961	IT'S FLOWING BIYE FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_962	CUT THE ENERGY BY THE BLUE LIGHT BULBS AND THE WORLL THE WIRES
Line_963	I NOTICE THAT LIGHT BULBS OT LIGHT ENOE AT THE WIRE
Line_964	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW I FORGOT
Line_965	M WITH TWO BATTERIES IT CAN MAKE IT BRIGHTER
Line_966	YES
Line_967	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE MORE BRIGHTER
Line_968	BIYE MAKE IT JOU' LIGHT BUN'TS WORK
Line_969	THE SECANT ONE
Line_970	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_971	NOT SO MUCH
Line_972	IT SHOWES THE LIGHT BUP
Line_973	IT HAS MAGNETS FORCE IN THEM
Line_974	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A REFRIGERATOR BECAUSE IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_975	BECAUSE THEY ARE METAL
Line_976	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_977	BECAUSE IT IS METAL IRON OR STEEL
Line_978	YES BECAUSE IT IS METAL I RIE TOLD YOU THAT
Line_979	I DON'T LIKE OU
Line_980	BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE IRON IN THEM
Line_981	MORE M MORE METAL STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_982	OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR OR FORCE FOR ITS SO IT CAN'T STICK
Line_983	SOME METALS FOR MAGNETS CAN STICK SO IT CAN WORK
Line_984	IRON
Line_985	IRON CAN STICK TO METAL BECAUSE IT HAS LOW MAGNETS IND THE
Line_986	THE ONE THAT'S NOT ALUMINIUM BECAUSE THAT HAS MORE FORSE THAN IN N THAT WO'S HIK IT'S METAL
Line_987	SO THE ROCK THE RING AND THE ALUMIU NAIL CAN'T STICK
Line_988	UH IT WON'T S WORK CUT IT HAS NO METAL ORNIT IN IT
Line_989	THAT THE GREY ROCK DOESN'T STICK
Line_990	THAT IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE HT HAS NO METAL IN IT OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_991	STICK COUS IT HAS MET IT'S METAL
Line_992	IT'S WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT SO LIKE LITTL STUFF ND THEIR
Line_993	BECAUSE ITY HAS METAL INSIDE IT
Line_994	IRON  METAL STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_995	TALKED ABOUT STUFF THAT CAN STICK TO METAL AND STUFF THAT CANT STICK TO METAL
Line_996	ONE IS WIRES TWO WIRES A BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_997	THEY GIVE OUT ENERGY FRSTL
Line_998	SOURCE IS ANOTHER WAY FOR SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU YES
Line_999	UM WHAT THEY THEY DO IS WE GIVE MORE ENERGY KIND OF
Line_1000	I THINK IT'S JAPATHWAY BECAUSE IT'S GOIN LIKE A PATH BECAUSE IT'S SO LIKE THIN A PATH IS THEN
Line_1001	BLIGHT BULBS ARE AR SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU LIGHT
Line_1002	THEY HELP YOU SEE AND MANY PLACES
Line_1003	A RECEIVER IS ANOTHER WORM FOR A LIGHT BULB
Line_1004	THAT MEANS THAT HOW THEY PUT IT TOGETHER THAT I THEY DID VERY GOOD UND THAT THEY MADE LIGHT
Line_1005	ROULE TINE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE IS ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1006	IT CIN O DIPENDS
Line_1007	UM WHERE THERE IS A MINES SIGNE
Line_1008	WELL THERE IS RED ON THAT SIDE AND THERE IS A FLAT SIDE ON THAT SIDE
Line_1009	THAT THE BATTERY TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S DOING THE UPAZ THING
Line_1010	NO IT IS THE MINOUS SCIEN IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN LIGHT BULB IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE BATTERY YOU GAEN
Line_1011	I AM SORY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_1012	THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CRAT ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND MAKE LIGHT WITH THAT
Line_1013	IT WILL NOT CARRIYE ENERGY UNOR BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1014	WELL KA BY YOUVE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO ME I HOPE I SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_1015	A LITTLE FLAG IS SHUR MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT MEANS THA IT IS WORKING
Line_1016	IF THE FLAG IS MADE FING THAT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1017	IT NEEDS ENERGY FOR TO RUN OR GASOLINE
Line_1018	THE WIRES ARE LIKE A PATHWAY AND ENERGY GOES THROUGH IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKES IT WORK
Line_1019	IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND IT TURNS
Line_1020	IT TURNS ON ONCE YOULE TERN ON THE SWITCH
Line_1021	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1022	REASE SLOWLY THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1023	WITS THE FLIE COODN'T MOVE
Line_1024	NO BECAUSE IF THE CADY DAY IS BLOCKING THE SUN
Line_1025	WIT'S COWDY THE  FLAG STOPS
Line_1026	THERE IS MOVING AND WORKING
Line_1027	WHEN THE SUNGETS TOTHE MOTOR IT'S THRIFTS TO ME
Line_1028	A NEW VANG A FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1029	UNBECAUSE IT'S METAL AND METAL I THINK HAS ENERGY
Line_1030	WELL USUALLY W MAKES THE MOTOR WORK IS NOT ALLNOT NOTHING ELSE TO MOR
Line_1031	UH USUALLY A NAIL
Line_1032	NO THINGS REALLY HAPPENING AIND SIN AND
Line_1033	YUSUALLY IN INSULATOR IS METAL AND THE CONDUCTOR IS USUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
Line_1034	IN THE LITORS ARE IERLY NOT METAL YEAH SO GYEAH
Line_1035	O M IT STIR'S MOVING BECAUSE IT IT'S NO METAL
Line_1036	THEY UMTHEY DON'T PART COLLEC THE
Line_1037	WELL CONDUCTORS  ARR UM SOMETHING METAL USUALLY
Line_1038	
Line_1039	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS WICK AND ONE CIRCUIT
Line_1040	BECAUSE OUT WITHOUT ENERGY WE COULDN'T BE MOVING
Line_1041	YOU IF THEY FIEL HEAT
Line_1042	THE SHEET IS PROABLY FLOWING AND GIVING US ENERGY
Line_1043	YES I HEAR FLAMES BURNING
Line_1044	ITTSON'T THIT KIND OF LIKE ASH SOUND
Line_1045	FIRE AR THE FLAME IS MAREAN SUCH SIDE
Line_1046	IT MAKES THE BIG THUMB
Line_1047	BECAUSE ENERGY IS YOURSE LIGHTER WHEN YOU MOVE
Line_1048	IT MAKES ALLOWED SOUND AND YOU'R WAISTING YOUR ENERGY
Line_1049	WE C HER A LOUD SOUND
Line_1050	THE GIRL IS USING HER ENERGY TO WALK
Line_1051	BY FIEELED AND APPLES FRIELDS SWETCHED THE BOLEDS
Line_1052	THERERE IT WOULD CAUSE A FLAME
Line_1053	YOU SEE KIND OF LIKE A GREY SEAN LIKE A GREAY CLOUD GOING UP
Line_1054	I WENT
Line_1055	THEY YOU GET ENERGY BY THE SAME THING
Line_1056	I TTHEY'RE ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1057	BEME IT WOULD CURENT IS SHOE EXCLAMED
Line_1058	BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH DIFFERENT N ENERGY THEY GET ENERGY BY DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_1059	YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH THE WE
Line_1060	EVEN TRYING TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_1061	THE CIRCUIT MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND IT HELPS MORE IN STEAD OF USING YOUR HANDS
Line_1062	TO GET HELPS IT BB U HELPS THE LIGHT BB LIGHT UP
Line_1063	TO THAT THE SAME THING JUST T TWIST IT IT WAT'S EASIER BECAUSE SM MATERIALS THE CIRCUIT HOLD
Line_1064	PASWAY
Line_1065	THE BLUE DULTS ARE THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_1066	WE THINK OF AS LITTLE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE PATHWAY AND T COMEG OUT LIKE A CAVE
Line_1067	WELL YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEY START TO LIGH UP MORE AND MORE
Line_1068	MAYBE MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO BE CIRCIN WEIGHT TO FOR ITTO LIGHT UP
Line_1069	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M GOOD HOW ARE YO
Line_1070	WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOGHT WITH THE BATTERIES
Line_1071	THEY ARE ALL KINDS OF MAGNETS FIRST IT'S A DONAMAGNET THEN IT'S A HORHO MAGNET AND THEN IT'S JUST A REGLAR MAGNET
Line_1072	WELL THEY CARRIY ENERGY INSIDE OF IT AND STICK TO ANYTHING STEEL AND THE M
Line_1073	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1074	YES BECAUSE THE WHOLE ENTIRE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL SO THE STEEL STICKS TO ANYTHING MAGNET IT
Line_1075	IT'S LIKE PROBABLY LIKE LITTLE TINY MAGNETS BECAUSE STHOM MAGNET TICK TOGETHER
Line_1076	THE NAIL STICK CILLO MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL THE OTHER ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL SO IT WON'T BE ABL TO STICK
Line_1077	ONLY GOSHOD TKS I NEVER NEW THAT WHEILL I JUST LEARND SOMETHING NEW TO NEAW
Line_1078	UM STEEL THAT'S FOR HER STEEL
Line_1079	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1080	THEY ARE TOOLES TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1081	WHEN THE WIRES ARE ATTATCHED TO THE BATTERY AND ATTATCHED TO THE LIGHT BULB THEY MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1082	THEY ARE PRITY MUCH THE ENERGY THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB GO ON AND THE WIRES THAT HIT IT
Line_1083	IT HELPS ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S COIND U LIKE THE BATTERY FOR THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1084	IT IS AN ENERGY SOURCE
Line_1085	THEY ARE A PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY WHICH IS THE SOURCE ENERGY SOURCE AND TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_1086	ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
Line_1087	THEY CARRY ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY SO THAT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_1088	THE LIGHT BULB HERE UM IS FOR THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY SO THEY WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1089	IN THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE FILLAMENT AND THE FILLARMENT UM HELPS IT LIGHT UP
Line_1090	IT RECEIVES ALL THE ENERGY
Line_1091	WHEN IT DOES THIS I THINK THERE IS ELECTRICITY SO THEN WE CAN HAVE LIGHT
Line_1092	THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1093	THE NEGATIVE AR THE THE PNEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1094	IT COME TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES TOWARDS THE WIRE AND COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE BATTERY
Line_1095	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1096	THE ELEC LITTLE ELECTRICITY BLUE DOCTS ARE GOING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_1097	IT TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY STARTED FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1098	IT GOES BACK THE WAY THAT IT STARTED
Line_1099	IT MIGHT GO FASTER OR THEY WOULD BOTH HIT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT MIGHT LIGHT UP OR IT MIGHT NOT
Line_1100	WHEN THE'RE ON ONES ON THE SIDE AND ONES ON THE BOTTOM IT WORKS BUT WHENTHE'RE BOTH ON THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1101	THE MOTOR FLAT THE FLAG ON THE MOTOR IS MOVING
Line_1102	IT 'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S  HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING
Line_1103	IT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND IT'S THE ENERGY IS MAKING IT MOVE
Line_1104	IT IS THE ENERGY AND IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CARE YOU MEAN THE BATTERY FOR THE CAR FOR IT TO WORK
Line_1105	IT IS NOT TOUCHING THE ONE SIDE WERE IT SHOULD BE AND THAT'S WHY THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING
Line_1106	THE FIVE ON THE MOTOR STARTS WORKING SO THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING IT WON'T WORK
Line_1107	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING WHAT IS LIKE CLOSED
Line_1108	A SOLAR THING IS MAKES SOME THINGS WORK
Line_1109	IF THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THEN THERE IS NO ENERGY COMING DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO MAKE THIRO
Line_1110	IT WOULN'T WORK WE WERE GONG NA DO THAT TO DAY ALSO BUT IT WAS GLADDY DAY SO IT DIDN'T WORK IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK
Line_1111	IT MAKES THE SOLAR PANEL HAVE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR YOU SHOWED ME THIS BEFORE IN THE CANNIN
Line_1112	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1113	YOU TO BIYE MORNE
Line_1114	GOOD HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU MAM MARNEY
Line_1115	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INCONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_1116	I SEE THAT THE GENERATOR FLAG ISN'T MOVING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT TURNED LIKE TO WHERE T IT WOULD BE ALL
Line_1117	I MAKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT IT WORKS RIGHT
Line_1118	OBJECTS THAT ARE INSULATORS DON'T WORK
Line_1119	BYE MARNEY THANKS FOR THE TOTORING BYIE
Line_1120	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY
Line_1121	THIS IS THAE CANDLE AND IT'S LIKE THE WARM FLOMATED A HANDROWBANK
Line_1122	THE HEAT IS MAKING THE IT'S SO HOT IT MAKES THE WAX MELT IT'S LIKE THE CARENT WHEN YOU GO IT BURNS OFF THE GUASS
Line_1123	I FLINK WHEN I WENT BYE IT OR LIKE CAND SEE IT'S IT'S LIKE HOT
Line_1124	THAT E GASS OR THE WAX IS LIKE GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE HEAT IS LIKE MAKING IT SO HOT THAT THEN WAX
Line_1125	UM LIGHT
Line_1126	THERE WAS NO SOUND THE THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AT ALL
Line_1127	A PERSON IS BANGING ON DRUMS
Line_1128	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE IS EATING FOOD SHE IS EATING THEN NAPL
Line_1129	IT IS MAKING SOUNDS
Line_1130	I SEE WOOD  FOULE LIKE GASS A LAINE I SEE A CANDLE AND THREE APPLES
Line_1131	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE YOU COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP BOTH LIKE THE WIRE AND THE BATTERY
Line_1132	IT'S ALL CONNECTED
Line_1133	AEALL M THE ELECTRICITY LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES AND INO THE LIGHT TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_1134	THE WHAT'S WHAI DO YOU THAY
Line_1135	O  MONEY THE CIRCUIT IS THE WHOLE THING CONNECTED AND THE PATHWAYS ARE THE WIRES
Line_1136	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT BULBT MAK
Line_1137	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS IN LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING IN THE LAIHT
Line_1138	THE BLU DOTS ARE THA LITTLE ENERGY AND THE ENERGY
Line_1139	OKAY I DID THAT MARNEY NO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE MEE
Line_1140	USUALLY ONE OR TWO OR MORE
Line_1141	WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL BOTH OF THEM ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND WLIGHT
Line_1142	WHEN YOU TAKE A BATTERY AWAY ITS THEN LIGHT BULBS AREN'T AS BRIGHT
Line_1143	IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
Line_1144	YOU ON THE ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS ARE'T BRIGHT AT ALL BUT ON THE TWO D CELL THE BRIGHT THE LIGHTS ARE REALLY REALLY REDT
Line_1145	YES AND IT WELL IT  LIKE WHEN YOU ADD IN ANOTHER D CELL THE LIGHTS THE BULBS OR LIGHTS GOT VERY
Line_1146	WE HAVE BEEN BILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_1147	IT HAS LIKE IT IT PRODUCES ENERGY
Line_1148	I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS U THE WIRES
Line_1149	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THETHE
Line_1150	THE PATHWAY IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1151	THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO THROUGH THE PATHLAY AND IT MOVES LIKE THROUGH E LIGHT BULB
Line_1152	YEAHTHE PATHWAY OR THE WIRES OR BOTH THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
Line_1153	BLOUWE DOTS ARE THE LITTALE DOUTS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1154	ELECTRICITY IS GOING LIKE THROUGH THE LIKE LITTLE PIECES OF ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH VERYTHING
Line_1155	WE WILL HAVE TO ADD MORE COMPONENTS LIKE ANOTHER BATTERY AND MORE WIRES
Line_1156	IF WE HAD MORE THAN ONE D CELL THE BULBS WILL LIGHT THE BRIGHTER
Line_1157	I SEE THAT SOME OTHER TIME THE BULB GETS TAKING AWAY IT'S DIFFERENT
Line_1158	WITH TWO D CELLS IT GOES BRIGHTER BUT ONECE THE ONE LIGHT BULB KETS TIAKING AWAY THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK
Line_1159	BECAUSE IT'S THEN BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND NOT THE POSIVE
Line_1160	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1161	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE LIGHTS ARE LIGHTING VERY BRIGHTLY
Line_1163	I SEE TWO TWO BULBS AND ONE D CELL
Line_1164	THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_1165	THE LIGHTS WILL PROBABLY GET MAYBE A LITTLE LESS BRIGHT OR NOT BRIGHT
Line_1166	I JUST TOLD YOU
Line_1167	MAYBE THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1168	REPEATE PLEASED
Line_1169	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1170	THERE ARE A LIGHT BULB A BATTERY AND WIRE
Line_1171	A D CELL BATTERY
Line_1172	THEY'RE ALL ABOUT HOW THEY THEY POWER EVERYTHING I DON'T I THINK
Line_1173	I MEAN THAT IT POWWERS MOSTLY EVERY THING
Line_1174	POWER ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SOURCE
Line_1175	LIGHT BULBS UM HELP LIGHT COME INTO THE ROUMITIC
Line_1176	IT MEANS THAT IT POWERES A LIGHT BULB FOR THE ROUM TO GET LIGHTER
Line_1177	IT'S M GOING UP AND DOWN AND UNDER
Line_1178	THE BOTTOM ONE WHICH IS PRINGING THE POWER AGAIN THROUGH THE BATTERY
Line_1179	THEY PREVENT THE POWER ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1180	I NOTICE IT SWITCHED AROUND SO IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW
Line_1181	IT GOES BACK WARDS SO IT GOES THE OTHER WAY WHERE IT WAS GOING BEFORE
Line_1182	IT CHANGES WHILE GOING THE OTHER WAY ROUND
Line_1183	THAT IT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH EVERY THING EVEN IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_1184	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1185	I THINK IT WOULD GET BRIGHTER TO BREAKE THE BULB OR IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1186	LEARNING HOW TO POWER MOT POWER A MOTOR
Line_1187	THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO POWER THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIT
Line_1188	FOR ELECTRICITY OR POWER TO GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR FOR THE FLAG TO STEK
Line_1189	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROGH THE WIRE
Line_1190	THE WIRES ARE COMING OUT A D CELL TO THE MOTOR AND THERE IS ALSO A SWIT
Line_1191	IT IT GETS THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE PAT THE MOTOR WORK
Line_1192	THE FLAT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO D CELL IGHT TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1193	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE MIDDAL
Line_1194	WHEN THE SWITCH IS  IS NOT ON THE METAL IT DOESN'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S ON THE METAL THE FLAG STARTS SPINI
Line_1195	THE FLAGS STOPS MOVIN
Line_1196	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THAT TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING FLAG SPIT
Line_1197	FOR THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO TO FROM THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_1198	POWER GOT TO THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE POWER AND THE MOTOR MAKE THE FLAG S
Line_1199	THE POWERS WENT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG WOR
Line_1200	TRYING TO PUT OBJECTS ON A SWITCH FORO THE MOTOR
Line_1201	THE HEAT FROM THE CANDLE IS MELTING THE CANDLESP
Line_1202	IT SPURNING THE CAN
Line_1203	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED IT UM TO HAVE LIGHTS IN EVERYTHING
Line_1204	CHEANCHEAN
Line_1205	I CAN SEE SHEETS SHE ENERGY FIRE AND THE CANDLE WAS MELT TO
Line_1206	UM SOUND ENERGY
Line_1207	I CAN TELL BECAUSE PEEP ONEED ENERGY TO WALK RUN AND SIT
Line_1208	ENERGY MAKES YOU WALK AND RUN IN SLEEP AND YOU CAN TELL SHE HAS ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING
Line_1209	BY EATING AND DRINKING THOT SO WA
Line_1210	THE MOTOR AND THE FLAG WILL M
Line_1211	OH I DON'T KNOW
Line_1212	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME
Line_1213	I DON'T KNOWAND I DON'T KNOW YEAH CAN YOU LEAST TELL ME PLEASE MARNEY
Line_1214	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT MUCH SCIENCE
Line_1215	IT'S A CANDLE AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING SCIENCE LIGHT
Line_1216	IT'S THE MELTING YEAH IT'S MELTING
Line_1217	NO BECAUSE I NEVER TOUCHED FIRE NO WOLD BE VERY STUPID  D AND YEAH YOU'RE QUIT IN ER CREENT
Line_1218	IT HIS ENERGY
Line_1219	IT'S HOWN LIKE THE
Line_1220	IT'S FLAMING

Line_1236	UN RENIABLE SOURCES
Line_1237	USING MAGNETCIC YOU AS A MAGNETANOISM
Line_1238	IT CIRCUITS ABOUTA FULL CI
Line_1239	UM
Line_1240	ELECTRICITY DEUS ENVOLVES S CIRCUITS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY MAKES A CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1241	FOR ELECTRICITY BEGOING THROUGH THE CIRCUT
Line_1242	IT FLOWS BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE POSIVE SIDE AND ON F THE WIRES ARN NEGATIVE SIDE MAKE ING IT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1243	THE BLUE DOT IS ELECTRIC
Line_1244	THEY WERE TO BE IT WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUIT AND THE ELECTRICITY WON'T
Line_1245	THEY WON'T GLOW POSSIBLY
Line_1246	IT' AFFECT IT BYE IT WILL GET MAYBE IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THE MORE D CELLS YOU GET FIT AND THE
Line_1247	UM UM THE

Line_1253	H WE HAVE YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWO BATTERIES  LIGHT BULBS IN A CIRCUIT
Line_1254	I SAY PU
Line_1255	MARNEY KITY REAP CET THATPLEASE WA
Line_1256	I HAVE NO GLADA CHICK YOU TELL ME AND F QUW
Line_1257	WITH TWO BATTERIES AND ONE LIGHT BULB IT'LL NOT WORK BUT WITH TWO BATTERIES TWO LIGHT BULBS THEN OUT WORK
Line_1258	CAN YOU REPEATE THAT PLESE IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE GOING TO JIV
Line_1259	I THINK NOUMBER ONE WHICH S ON THE TOP
Line_1260	I THINK A CIRCUIT NUMBER TWO AND S CRACT CIRCUIT IN EVERYTHI
Line_1261	WE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND EVERYTG
Line_1262	CAN YOU REPEET UP THESE SLOWLY
Line_1263	END YOU DON'T HAVE A CIRCUIT D NO
Line_1264	SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1265	UM I N NO
Line_1266	I I THAT'S ARY UM CAN YOU REPEATE THAT SLOWLY OR CAN YOU SAY LIKE A CHIPMUNK
Line_1267	THEN YOU DON'T KNOW HAV FR A FULS CIRCUIT
Line_1268	WCAN YOU REPETE THAT SLOWLY
Line_1269	UMIT CAN B NOT I DON'T KNOW
Line_1270	BBECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CRACK
Line_1271	I TOLD YOU THE LIGHT BULB FILLMENT IS NOT LARGE E
Line_1272	CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME MY NOWING FREND YONAR WAS BUGING M
Line_1273	DEING NOIED THAT MYENOYING FRANCHIONA WAS BUING
Line_1274	NE CYANA SIR THE LIGHT BUBBLB
Line_1275	KETON IVE SHE FIE HE ON A THAT MADNEWAS BUGING
Line_1276	RANOWA THE THING IS UP THERE'S TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS TWO MORE NO WIE
Line_1277	THE FILMENT BROKE
Line_1278	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT IT'S PLIKED
Line_1279	BY AND BESIDE CAN YOU GOT A PE HE HN'T GET ME A PE
Line_1280	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGMOISM
Line_1281	ITS SOUTH AND NORTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL STICK BUT IF SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE TOGETHER THEY WILL REPELL
Line_1282	UM I CANT CAVREERS GET TO LESS IMPOE
Line_1283	IT'S METAL SO IT'LL ATTRACTS A MAGNET
Line_1284	A NAIL IS STICKING TO A ADONA SHAPED MAGNE
Line_1285	IT STICKS BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL IS META
Line_1286	THE METDAL DOES NOT ATTRACT TO THE BLOCK BECAUSE IT'S WOOD
Line_1287	BECAUSE WONE CAN ATTRACT TO A MAGNET BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR METAL OR STEEL
Line_1288	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE NAIL HAS ONE NAIL HAS IRON AND METAL AND THE OTHER DOESN'T
Line_1289	IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_1290	I THINK IT HAS METAL OR STEEL OR IRON IN IT BECAUSE ITS STICKING
Line_1291	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1292	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IRON METAL OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1293	BECAUSE IT'S STEEL WON'T METAL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1294	I'M GOOD I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1295	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1296	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES
Line_1297	THE D CELL IS IMPORTANT CAUSE THEN IT GIVES OFF ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1298	IT MEANS LIKE A PASSWAIGHT TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE ENERGY AND THE WIRES
Line_1299	I SEEN TRAVELES MEANS LIKE IT GOS LIKE THROUGH THE WIRES AND OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB DO CENT OFF ELECTRICITY
Line_1300	THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY
Line_1301	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ABOUT LIKE CA CEND THE LIGHT SO THEN YOU COULD SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IT'S NOT JUST A PITCH BLACK PLATE
Line_1302	IT MEANS LIKE IT RECHEVES THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE WIRES
Line_1303	I SEE THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT AND GOING IN THE CHIRCLE SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE THE LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1304	IT IS FLOWING THE LEFT WAY LIKE IT GOES RIGHT AND THEN IT GOES DOWN IN THE  IT'S GOTH AROUND
Line_1305	HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_1306	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY THE WIRES IK SEE T IN TH PICTURE S GOING THROUGH AND TAND GOING OUT THAT'S OW I WORK
Line_1307	THE END OF THE D CELL  WITH THE MINEISONIE
Line_1308	IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1309	THE BUDS REPROSENT THAT THE THE BUDS REPROSENT THE ELECTRICITY FONE
Line_1310	I DON'T KNOTICE ANYTHING I'M SORY I DON'T KNOTICE ANYTHNI
Line_1311	IT GOES THE OPPOSIT WAY IT WOS GOING NOW IT'S GOING THE LEFT WAY NOT THE RIGH
Line_1312	IT GOES THE I WAIGH IT WAS FOLLING
Line_1313	THEA MINES
Line_1314	WHAT'S IT UP I DON'T SEE ANY SIT UP
Line_1315	I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HINTS ABOUT IT
Line_1316	UP THE D CELL TO MAKE IT WORK IF TIF THERE WASN'T A D CELL THEN NOW WOULD THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1317	THE FLAG STOP S MOVING AND IT WON'T WORK
Line_1318	I NOTICE THAT WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH THE FLAGH STOPS TO MOVE AND THEN WHEN I STICK IT AGAIN THEN IT STOPS MOVING
Line_1319	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR HAS  WIRES HEPD  TO WEGH AND THE WIRES  HARHUKED UP TO THE SOLAR POWER
Line_1320	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN IT MEANS THAT IT'S COLLECTING ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR POWER TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_1321	IT WON'T WORK AND  IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN HOW WILL YOU MAKE THIS MOTOR WORK
Line_1322	THE FLAG IS THE MOTOR IS RUNING
Line_1323	WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT FLAG IS NOT MOVING
Line_1324	IF THE WAG IS 'T MOVING THEN IT MEANS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER IT
Line_1325	WHELL KNO HOW IS YOUR DA
Line_1326	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1327	CAN YOU PLEASE US THE QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1328	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BY THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1329	UH ANYTHING THAT'S METAL CAN MICKE MOTOR
Line_1330	I NOTICE THAT IF THE STICK S WARED AND IT DOESN'T COLLECT THE ELECTRICITY AND E THE MOTOR'S NOT RUNING
Line_1331	TO CIT'S HAVE PENNOLES THAT TA
Line_1332	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION AGAIN
Line_1333	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEATE THAT
Line_1334	WHT CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT IT OF ANOYIN LITTLE CATE RIGHT RIGHT NOW AROUND MAMY THING YOU STOCK AN SMACK SO CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1335	THE MOTOR WHAPPENS TO THE MOTOR AS IT DOESN'T RUN
Line_1336	PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_1337	THEY ARE MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1338	WE RIGHT NOW SO CAN YOU PLEASE REBEA THAT PLTEY
Line_1339	THE BRASS ROUM THE PAPER CLIP THE WHOLD ON THE MSHIEN ROU CQUWLIP
Line_1340	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1341	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE TWO LIGHT BULPS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1342	WE'VE BEEN DOING HOW SHE WOOD WOULD MAKE TO LIGHT BULBS TO LIGHT WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_1343	I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FIEOUAL
Line_1344	IT GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT
Line_1345	YO I DON'T SHEO'RE ANYTHING WHEN THE CANDL BURNS
Line_1346	IF A CANDLE DIDN'T MAKE SOUND THEN IT WOUL MAKE LIKE PM NOISES
Line_1347	I CAS SEE THAT THE FLAME IS MOVING BACK AND FORWARDS FORTH SLOWLY
Line_1348	I SEE THAT THERE IS A FEUWELE WOOD AND THE CANDLE AND TH THREE APPLES
Line_1349	INKING AROUND
Line_1350	IT TURNED INTO SMOKE
Line_1351	WE PEAT PLEASED
Line_1352	THE MOTOR THE MOTORS  WE STARTED SPINING IN A CIRCLE
Line_1353	WE TAKE TON FROM EAH
Line_1354	N I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_1355	THEY BOTH COLLECT
Line_1356	AND COAL AND GUASS WILL MAKE A FIRE
Line_1357	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1358	REPEAT
Line_1359	I DO NOT COMPLETELY NO
Line_1360	UM REAPE PLUBEAE
Line_1361	WE PEACED POLLICE
Line_1362	I THINK THE BANRY WOULD RUN OUT  ENERGY BECAUSE OU AS MORE LIGHT BULBS AND THEI IT WON'T BE THAT BRIGHT
Line_1363	REBE  SCHLEESE SCHLEESED
Line_1364	IF YOU ADD ONE MORE UM MORE D CHELLS THE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BRIGHTER
Line_1365	GOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1366	WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN DOING SOCIAL STUDYES AN THAT SIENCE
Line_1367	WHAT I'V OBSERVED ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT IS THAT DICK STICK TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1368	WHAT IT DOS HAVE TO DO WITH SHAKING TO A MAGNET IS THAT A MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS IRON AND STEEL
Line_1369	WHAT'S IN THE METAL IS IT LIKE TIGNEY BITS OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT HELPS IT STICK
Line_1370	VOUVORY PEAKED PEILIEACE
Line_1371	IT IS TRUG THAT PAPER CLIPS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1372	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1373	I'M GOOD TO TAY HOW ARE YOU
Line_1374	WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT H
Line_1375	I THINK THAT BECAUSE I LEARND IT
Line_1376	THEY'RE FASING THE SOUT AND SOUT ARE FASCING EACH OTHER AND THOS ENNOTS ARE FASING EACH OTHER SOL WITHILL
Line_1377	THE SUMMARBOUTTOUM IS THAT SOUTH AND NORTH ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THE FACT BECAUSE THEY'RE FASING THEY'RE IN THE OPPOSIT DIRECTION SO WIT THE ATTRACT
Line_1378	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1379	WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS THAT TO LEARN ABOUT MAGNET AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_1380	HINTEE ONE LENE
Line_1381	WHAT MAKES ME SAYE THAT IS BECAUSE I TRIED IT WITH A MAGNET AND A PAPER CLIP AND I I UKED IT UP TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WHICH ITS LIKE ATTRACTD
Line_1382	OKIE WHAT'S DOA MAGNET IS CENDING I LAR UHM MAGNETISM THROUGH THE NAIL TO PICK UP THER STOFVOKIE
Line_1383	THREAPE PLEANSE
Line_1384	THAT AS YOUR MOM WAS PAYING YOUR PIGNES
Line_1385	REPEATELECE
Line_1386	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT RENE CECIALS ORE IN LEARNING ALL
Line_1387	WHAT'S IT ABOUT IS THA WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT A MAGNET WILL ATTRACT
Line_1388	WHAT MAKES ME SEE THAT  BECAUSE I TEST ED IT OUT
Line_1389	WHAT'S ABOUT THAT IS I SHAKE YOU AND A
Line_1390	NOT REALLISED HOW ARE YOU
Line_1391	SKI ME PPLEN WHE PIER
Line_1392	YOU HAVE TE  U R PEAINTS
Line_1393	RUPET ITS I D I CIFITY
Line_1394	WILLIN WE LARN NA WHEN TO BE DONE
Line_1395	I COLLECTED FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_1396	THERE IS A UBLEADAL ONE
Line_1397	LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1398	A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1399	THEY POWER STUFF LIKE COMPUTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_1400	IT STORES ENERGY AND THEN IT GIVES OTHER THINGS ENERGY TO USE
Line_1401	I DON'T KNOWDON'T
Line_1402	ELECTRICITY OR POWBER
Line_1403	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THEY RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES OR THE BATTERY
Line_1404	IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_1405	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGWART THE POSITIVE END
Line_1406	IT GOES TOWARDS THE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THEN NE
Line_1407	IT GOES BACK TO WHAT IT WAS NO N THE WEY A THE ELECTRICITY FLOWES BACK TO THE SIDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO US IN THE FIERS
Line_1408	IT IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE TOUCH
Line_1409	IT WOULDN'T WORK IT WOULDN'T FLOW LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO
Line_1410	THE SIDES THE SIDES WORK
Line_1411	WE'VE BEEN LODING LEARNING HOW A MOTOR WORK
Line_1412	BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWER BY THE D CELL AND THE MOTOR IS POWERING THE FLAG
Line_1413	THAT THERE IS POWERING THE MOTOR IT HAS ENDY
Line_1414	THE MOTOR IS GETTING POWERED BY THE D CELL
Line_1415	IT MI I DON'T KNOW HOW SHALLY I DON'T
Line_1416	IT IT GIVES THE MOTOR POWER SO THE FLAW CAN RUN
Line_1417	THIS IS UM MOTOR WITH A SWITCH A CIRCUIT WITH A SWIT
Line_1418	THE MOTOR IS SPINING
Line_1419	BECAUSE THE SWITCH WAS IN TOUCHING THE WIRE
Line_1420	IT STOPS BECAUSE IT CANT FLOW THROUGH THE PUF TO THE POSITIVE SE
Line_1421	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSE
Line_1422	WHEN IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE THE MOTOR SPINS WHEN IT'S NOT THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_1423	I WAS ABSENT THAT DAY
Line_1424	THAT THE SUN IS THERE TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Line_1425	IT WOULDN'T WORK
Line_1426	THE THE FLAG STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1427	IT PRODUCES ENERGY SO THAT SOAR SOAL OR PANEL CAN GET ENERGY FOR THE MOUNT
Line_1428	IT IS A CIRCUIT WITH THE MOTOR
Line_1429	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING OT WHAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH
Line_1430	HOW ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH SOMETHINGS BUT NOT OTHERS
Line_1431	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH EVERY CINL PART OF THE CIRCUIT
Line_1432	THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1433	SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE LIST WORKS BUT OTHERS DON'T LIKE THE SPUNGE AND THE ROCKS
Line_1434	THAT WITH STICK THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_1435	IT IS OPEN
Line_1436	IT DOES IND IT STOPS SPINNING
Line_1437	UH I COULDN'T MOVE MY ITUM SO
Line_1438	THEY ARE METAL
Line_1439	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS ATTRACT AND REPELL EACH OTH
Line_1440	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1441	THEY ARE MAKING THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
Line_1442	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_1443	IT ISN'T JUST TWO WIRES IT'S FOR WIRES
Line_1444	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_1445	EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_1446	THEY ARE LIGHTING UP CLERALLY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE I THINK THEY EACH HAS THEIR OWN UH WHAT DO YOU PATHWAY
Line_1447	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL SHINE BRIGHTER
Line_1448	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1449	REPEATE THAT PLEEN
Line_1450	IT IS SHOWING WHAT PATHWAY IT'S GOING
Line_1451	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS BUT ONE D CELL
Line_1452	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOP AR BRIGHTER THAN THE LIGHT BULBS ON THE BO
Line_1453	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_1454	NEED A THEY NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_1455	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN CONNECTED IT'S NOT
Line_1456	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN IT DOESN'T
Line_1457	YOU HACTUAOLL REPLACE THE LIGHT BULB OR D CELL
Line_1458	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WORKS BETTER THAN A NORMAL CIRCUIT ECAUSE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS ON PATH
Line_1459	THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY OF ENERGY
Line_1460	THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_1461	YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1462	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND NOW THE THERE IS NO PATHWAY
Line_1463	THERE I'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY
Line_1464	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1465	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1466	THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1467	A SERIES I MEAN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1468	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS CKEEP SLIGHTING
Line_1469	THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS TOLE HEEPS GIVING WE
Line_1470	ONE FILLIM A BROK BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS ARE STILL WORKING
Line_1471	THE FILLMENT IT BURNS OUT BUT THE LIGHT BUB THE OTHER LIGHT BUB SULP
Line_1472	THEY ALL CONNECT TO THE D CELL
Line_1473	HERE IS A BURN OUT FILLMENT
Line_1474	BECAUSE THE FILMANT BROKE AND THERE IS NO OTHER PATHWEY TO GUET THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1476	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1477	I LEARN THAT IN CLASS THAT IRON OR STEEL ATTRACT MAGNETS
Line_1478	THE THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIEDGE
Line_1479	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE REFRIGERATE
Line_1480	THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET THE MAT YEAT
Line_1481	THERE IS IRON OR STEEL AND THE NAIL
Line_1482	S YES THERE IS IRON OR STEEL IND THE NIT
Line_1483	WORD DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1484	IRONS THAT OU MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_1485	THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL INSIDE OF IT
Line_1486	UH THEY STICK TO STUFF THAT ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1487	ONE NAIL HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL I
Line_1488	THE ONE THAT IS MADE OF STEEL
Line_1489	THE STUFF THAT HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT STICKS BUT THE STUFF DOES THAT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1490	IT WILL NOT STICK BCAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN I
Line_1491	IT STICKS
Line_1492	ALL IM Y HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT AND THAT'S WAY
Line_1493	SOME METALS HAVE IRON IN THEM OR STEEL AND THOSE WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1494	BECAUSE IT HAS IRON OR STEEL AND SAY INSIDE OF
Line_1495	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1496	NORTH AND SOUTH NORTH AND SOUTH STICK TOGETHER BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH WEP
Line_1497	THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE MAGNET ARE STICKING
Line_1498	BECAUSE SIDES NORTH AND NORTH WE PEL BUT SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRAC
Line_1499	SIDES NORTH AND NORTH SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL BUT NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT
Line_1500	UH THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ATTRACTING OR SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ATTRACTING
Line_1501	A GIRL HIKING NORTH
Line_1502	I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S POINTING NORTH
Line_1503	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ON A MAGNET ATTRACTS BUT NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1504	THE SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH THIKE TRA
Line_1505	SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACTS BUT NORTH AND NORTH REPEL AND SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL
Line_1506	THERE IS A MAGNET MAGNETIC FORCE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUT THE TABLE IS STOPING IT FROM GETTING ALL THE WAY THERE
Line_1507	UTHERE I'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE TO REACH THE PAPER CLIP SO IT CANT MOVE THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1508	THE MAGNET IS TRAVELING THE MAGNEGATIVE FLOOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1509	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRAVELING INTO THE NAIL AND IT'S MAKING IT ACT LIKE A
Line_1510	THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL TICK LIKE A MAGNET SO THE PAPER CLIP CAN STICK TO THE NAIL
Line_1511	THE MAGNET IT'S TO BE REALLY STRONGED
Line_1512	AT THE TOP OF THE NAIL
Line_1513	BECAUSE ITS A DIFFERENT FORCE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRAVELERS THROUGH THE NAIL AND PICKS UP THE PAPE C
Line_1514	IT HELPS THE NAIL WILL GET A MAGNETIC FORCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1515	THE NAIL WOULD LOUSE ITS FORCE
Line_1516	IT WON'T BECOME A MAGNET FOR A MAGNET IS N'T TOUCHING IT
Line_1517	THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THEN NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET WHICH IS PICKING UP THE PAPR
Line_1518	IT'S BECOMING A TEMPORARAL AARE YOU MAGNET
Line_1519	IT'S ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET IS TOUCHING IT AND THEN IT HAS A MAGNETIC FOR
Line_1520	IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1521	THE NAIL IS BECOMING A TEMPORAR TEMPORARALLY A MAGNET AND IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP

Line_1641	UM DON'T KNOW
Line_1642	IT'S THROWING THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1643	ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THIS ONE HIN THE WIRES TAKES THE ENERGY GOES TO THE T THEN IT FLOWS TO THER BING COMES TO THE OTHER ONE
Line_1644	THAT IS THE ENERGY
Line_1645	IT HAS TO BE FLOWED THROUGH MANY TOLE RECEIVERS
Line_1646	MOTRABULE AND CONON ENERGY FLOWSY THEIRE COMES OU OUT TO THE LIGHT BULBS ONE LIGHT BULB GET ANOTHER AND THON'T COME BACK
Line_1647	THREYE THREE THREE
Line_1648	YOU NEED MORE POWER SOURCE
Line_1649	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GAIN
Line_1650	THAT THEY GET DIMMER
Line_1651	THE LIGHT BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_1652	IT GOVES IN MOLE ENERGY
Line_1653	UM IF IT ONECE IT THEN BOTH OF THEM M GOES OUT ONE OF THEM GOES OUT THE YOU HAVE TO REPLACE ANOTHER ON
Line_1654	BECAUSE THEY THEN PRLESS AND PRLESS ARE TOUCHING TOGETHER
Line_1655	UM WHENSE YOU TURN ONE OF THES D CELLS AROUND IT WILL START WORKING AGAIN
Line_1656	IF IF TWO OF THE SAME SIDE TOGETHER IT WOUN'T WORK
Line_1657	DON'T WELL PUT TWO BATTERIES TOGETHER ON THE SAME SID
Line_1658	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BUS TO TEY REALLY BRIGHT
Line_1659	UM THIS IS A PARALLE CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT HAS ONE BATTERY BUT FORE WIRES

Line_1661	EACH HAD THEOVER AND A I CHEP THE LON PATHWAY
Line_1662	A WAIVE SLOW PRULS FALLWARD
Line_1663	IT IT'S GARRIN FEAIR THE NEGATIVE TO THE TODLIGHT BULB
Line_1664	I SEE  I SEE IT'S GOING NORTH
Line_1665	THAT IS REALLY
Line_1666	IT FLOWS MWHEN A STON FLOLWLING THROUG THE IR ONES IT IT FLOWS THROUGH THE POSIT
Line_1667	UH  ABCIRVIDY GOES FROM ONE TO AN
Line_1668	IT IS BURNING NOT IT'S NOT BURNING AS LONG IT'S BURNING ROUDLY QUICK
Line_1669	THERE IS TWO PALA SOURCES
Line_1670	UM IT'S SHARING THE SAME POWER SOUICE IT NO NEVER MAN
Line_1671	THEY'RE SHARING THE SAME FLOWER OF THENUZIEAH
Line_1672	YES THERE IS TWO BUT THE I IS MORE ENERGY SO THAT'S WHY IT'S YOU REP RIGHT
Line_1673	THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1674	ARRLE CIRCUIT OND THE TOP RIGHT
Line_1675	THE TOP RY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1676	BECAUSE EXPERIMENTE WITH AN ELECTRO MAGNE
Line_1677	THERE IS A BARMAR MAGNET GOING A MAGNET AND HURCSHO
Line_1678	MAGNETS MAGNETS ONLY CAN STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_1679	MAGNETS ONLY COULD STICK TO ANYTHING MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1680	MADY CAN YOU REPEETE THAT
Line_1681	E'R STICKIN CUPULI FRIJURE EITER
Line_1682	THERE T JURIATOUR IS MADE OF IRON FROM STEEL
Line_1683	THERE IS A STEEL NAIL AND I DON'T WHAVE MAGNET
Line_1684	TINE REPEATE THA
Line_1685	CEAN ARIEE PIEETE THAT
Line_1686	WOD A ALULINIUM CHESE
Line_1687	REASON THAT IIS BECAUSE ONLY CERTON ITUMS IS MADE OUT OF STEELOR IRO
Line_1688	THEN THE WOODEN BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1689	THE IT'S SDE IRON ANYTHING THAT MATDE THOSE TWO MATERIALS WILL STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1690	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON AND STEEL
Line_1691	OH ANY OTHER PIXTURE
Line_1692	THAT THE STEEL NAIL IS STICKING AND ALUMINNAIL AS NOT BECAUSE THE STEEL WILL IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND THE ALUMINIUMS NOT
Line_1693	GELUINIUM ALUINIMUMS ANDE ALUMINIUM IS NOT MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1694	BECAUSE NOT ALL METALS IS MADE O OF IRON OR STEEL BUT THE STEEL NAILS ARE MADE OF IRON
Line_1695	INARON AND THE STEEL NAIL
Line_1696	UHM  I DON'T KNOW
Line_1697	THE STEEL AN NEA YOU HAS IRON IN
Line_1698	THIS DEERE NAIR IS TO THE KING TO DEMA

Line_1700	THE GREY WAROCK WOLE NOT WORK BECAUSE IT HAS NO IRON
Line_1701	ITIT HAS STEEL IN IT
Line_1702	IT HAS IRORON AND STEEL IN IT
Line_1703	BECAUSE IT HAS STEE
Line_1704	UH STEEL
Line_1705	THINK WE LEARN TODAY IT HAS TO STICK TO MAGNETS IT HAS TO BE UH MADE OF STEEL OR
Line_1706	HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_1707	A BATTERLY WIRLES AND THEND LIGHT BULL
Line_1708	THAT YOU GIVE THE LIGHT BULLB ENERGY
Line_1709	IT'S THE SOUCE THAT GIVES THE UM LIGHT BULB ENARGY
Line_1710	IF THOUGH CONNECTED TO THE D CELL THEY TRANSFUL THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1711	THEY THEY LIGHT UP IF IT HAS A SORC OF ENERGY
Line_1712	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THATN  IT RECEIVES THAT ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1713	THE D CELL IS GIVING THE THE H LIGHT BULB UM AND O J THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1714	THE THE POWERE COMES FROME THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES TO HE LIGHT BULB AND COMES TO THE POSITIVE
Line_1715	IT GIVES IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1716	IT LIGHTS UP
Line_1717	IT MOVES THE OPOSIT WAY
Line_1718	THE NEGATIVE
Line_1719	BUT BOTH OF THE WIRE THERE'S ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THERE'S ONE WIRE GOING FROM THIS SIDE
Line_1720	IT WOULDN'T GIVE IT ANY LECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE COULDN'T BE ANY GOING OUT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_1721	THE LIGHT BULB NOT LIT UP WHEN I CHANGED IT TO A SIDE
Line_1722	WE'VE BEEN LARNING LARNING ABOUT MOTALES AND WILES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTAL MOIANT OF THE THING
Line_1723	THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND TS MAKING THE MOTAL MOVE
Line_1724	THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTALE IS WALKING AND IT'S MOVING
Line_1725	THE MOTOL IS WALKING
Line_1726	THEREW'S ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT
Line_1727	THE MOTAR STOPS MOVING
Line_1728	THAT IT'S UM THAT THETHE IT'S THAT'S IT'S OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S OFF
Line_1729	THE MOTALE STOPS MOVING
Line_1730	THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1731	IT'S IN THE CLOSED POUSITION
Line_1732	NO ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTAL BECAUSE NOT TRAVELING TROUGH THE METAL AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THE MOTAL RUN
Line_1733	THEY THE SUN COME IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON IT IT GIVES ELECTRICITY D TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1734	IT'S SANIEAW AND THE SOLLA PANEL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTAL
Line_1735	THE SOLE PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
Line_1736	THE SOLL PANELS UM GIVING IT ELECTRICITY CELL CAN MOVE
Line_1737	THAT IT TORNS THE SUN SHINE INTO ELECTRICITY AND GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO OTHER THINGS
Line_1738	I NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOES NO SN ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO ELECTRICITY
Line_1739	THE MOTALE STOPS RUNNING
Line_1740	IT GIVES HA SOLE PANELS ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTAL SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTAL RUNS AND MOVES
Line_1741	IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY TO GET IT TO IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ELECTRICITY
Line_1742	MAKES THE MOTAL MOVE
Line_1743	UT IT'S NOT GIVING IT LESELECTRICITY TO MOVE
Line_1744	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTAL ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTAL MOVES
Line_1745	WE HAVE BEEN LONING ABOUT CILLIES CIRCUITS
Line_1746	THEAS A CANDLE IN IT'S LIGHT AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GIVING OFF HE ENERGY AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1747	THE WAX IS BURNING BECAUSE IT'S THE CANDL IS GITTING OFF YHOU ENERGY FROM THE FILE
Line_1748	HE ENERGY LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1749	LIGHT EAND AND LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1750	NO YOU WNO YOU DO NOT YOU DON'T HEAL ANYTHING THERE'S NO SOUND ENARY TO IT
Line_1751	GIVING OFF GIVING OFF LIGHT AND HEAT
Line_1752	THE SELND ENERGY AND DOESE ALSO FOOD ENERGY BECAUSE YOU NEED THE FOOD ENERGY TO MAKE YOUR HANDS MOVE TO TO DO THAT
Line_1753	IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THAT SOUND IS SOUND ENERGY SOUND ENERGY
Line_1754	SUDENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY
Line_1755	I SEE I I GUESS CAN I SEE WOD I SEE APPLES I SEE MOLD AND I SEE A CANDLE
Line_1756	IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_1757	IT'S TURNED INTO EXZAUST AND EXZAUSTRALL POLLUTE TEYLE
Line_1758	ONE IS ONE IS LIKE A LIQUID AND ONE IS JUST LIKE LIKE A LOCK IT'S JUST SOLID
Line_1759	IT WILL POLLUTE DEELS
Line_1760	THE GASSM COAS ILL POLLUTE THE ULFS AND THE SOLT PANELS AND THE WINTOL BINES WON'T
Line_1761	IT IT WOULD POLLUTE IT WOULD POLLUTE IT
Line_1762	WE'VE BEEN BILDING CILLIES CIRCUITS
Line_1763	THE D CELL IS GIVING POWER FROM THE NEGATIVE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE INTO THE WIRES TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1764	THAT ONE D CELL CAN BE USED A POW THE MANY THINGS THAT IT WAT ONE TIME
Line_1765	THAT THEY ALL ALL IN THE CIRCUITAND THEY ALL DO P A JUM AND TE CIRCUIT
Line_1766	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE D CELL AND THEN MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES TO WHATEVELS HOOKED UP TO THE WIRES
Line_1767	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL AND BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1768	THAT IT'S GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND MAKING THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN COMING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1769	THAT REPROSENTS THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FLOWING
Line_1770	IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE BATTERIES TO MAKE THEM LIGHT I MEANG INTO THE LIGHT BULBS TO MAKE THEM LIGHT
Line_1771	FLOWS FROM IT FLOWS FROM A D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE FILMNET AND BACK
Line_1772	ONE PATHWAY GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1773	TAKE MORE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL
Line_1774	IT GETS IT GETS LESS BLIGHT
Line_1775	BECAUSE ONE BATTERY IS RIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS YEA SQUAIT AND THE ELECTRE LIGHT IN EVERYTHING SO YEAH
Line_1776	IT HAS IT'S OWN PAPLAY
Line_1777	SO WE THEY BOTH ALL USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1778	THEY BOTH AR THEY BOTH ARE USING THE SAME PATHWAY
Line_1779	THE LIGHT BULBS BECOME BRIGHTALE
Line_1780	WELL THE CILLIES CIRCUIT IT WOULD THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE DIM BUT IN A PILL PILLLLEVE CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE THE LIGHT
Line_1781	THERE IS CILLIES CIRCUIT AND PILL PILLWELL LEVEL CILCUITS
Line_1782	SOME SHILLD ON PHALFWAY OF ELECTRICITY AND SOME HAVE THO OWN PALPHLAI OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1783	WEL THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ENERGY AND THEY WON'T BE AS BIGHT THAT WAY
Line_1784	WELL SOME SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY AND SOME DON'T BUT IF THEY SHOW THE SAME PATHWAY THEY WON'T BE AS BLIGHT
Line_1785	WELL THE FLOW WOULD THEY SHOLD THE SAME FLOW SO THE LIGHT BULBS ON TO  BE AS LIGHT
Line_1786	THAT SHOWING THE SAME FLOW
Line_1787	WELL IT SHO ITS SHILLING ENERGY FROM A LIGHT BULB FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1788	OR IT'S FLOWING IN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE M R LIGHT BULB
Line_1789	WELL IT'S COMING OUT OF THE SIDE AND GOING BACK INTO THE D CELL
Line_1790	WELL THE TOP ONES ILL LIGHT THE BOTTOME ONE IS NOT SO BLIGHT AND BUT LIKE THE BOTTOME ONE IS SHOWING A PATHWAY OFELECTRICITY THE TELP ONE'S ALVED
Line_1791	THE TOP ONES AN'T SHILING THE SAME PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1792	WELL IT'S SHOWING THE SAME IT'S SHOWING THE SAME PATHWAY SO  THOUG NOT GOING TO GETI AS MUCH AS ELECTRICITY INTO THEM
Line_1793	WELL UM THEY BOTH HAVE TWO BATTELIES NOW INSTEAD OF ONE AND THEL PUTY BLIKE
Line_1794	UM THE THE TOP TO THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
Line_1795	UP ONES BECAUSE THEM MORLE BRITELE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE BETTALE
Line_1796	UM SOAR DOING A PPE UM AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1797	TICITYA CIRCUIT UM HAS TO HAVE POWER SO YE COULD BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1798	A CIRCUIT HELPS TO HELP TO ENERGY
Line_1799	IT ISN'T A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONNECT A BATTERY AND ALL THE WIRES
Line_1800	S AND THIS  BE ABLE TO WORK
Line_1801	THIS CIRCUIT HAS A PATHWAY WITH THE WA
Line_1802	IT HAS LVEN IT BECAUSE THAT ELECTRICITY FALLS FROM THE POSITIVE SLIGHTE AND UNTO UM THEN IT COMES IN THE NEGATIV SIDE
Line_1803	IT'S FLALLING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY
Line_1804	I THEY REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IT TH
Line_1805	THE I THINK THEY ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY LITTLE TCT
Line_1806	U POSITIVE SIDES INTO THE NEGATIVE SAME
Line_1807	PUPOSITIVE SIDE
Line_1808	WI WE HAVE TO DO THAT
Line_1809	IS LESS ELCTRICITY
Line_1810	YEAH MORE THAN ONE DCELL IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTOL IT LAK CLIP BURNS OUT
Line_1811	BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1812	IT THEIT DOESN'T GO WITH NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE AND HEN GOES POSITOR POSITIVE GOES NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE
Line_1813	THAT MIX IT TURNED OFF IS THAT THE BOTH D CELLS ARE THE POSITIVE AND THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE WITH THE NEGATIVE AND THAT'S MAKING TURN OUT
Line_1814	IS FLIP THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_1815	ENERGY COULD TRAVEL FOR MIRES
Line_1816	LIGHT BULBS ARE ALL ABOUT LIKE IT GIVES YOU WHITE SO
Line_1817	WUT I HAVE BEEN DOING A CIAENCITING ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITS AND LIGHT BULBS
Line_1818	A CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGHI
Line_1819	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH
Line_1820	TH BOLLYGQUWIRES LEAD TO WE PRYTHETIC LAY
Line_1821	M IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH A BASING WIRE AND IT CASING WIRE
Line_1822	THERE IS NEETED THREE TWO OR ONES PATHWAY
Line_1823	WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS THE LIGHT GETS IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER
Line_1824	IF THEY GET LESS ENERGY IT WILL NOT BECAUSE IT WON'T GET THE
Line_1825	UM IT'LL IT'LL THE LIKE POLUTION BEFORE WE IMVT T LIKE TAKE THE LIGHT AND W BURN IT OUT
Line_1826	WE HAPPEND WHEN WE OTHER AND ADDED ANOTHER BATGERY S
Line_1827	IT THINK THEY'ULD BE AFFECTED BY GETTING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1828	WHAT I DISCOVER IS THE ELECTRICITY IS NOW FLOWING HO I THE LIGHT BULB AND ECAN WELL MSHINING  TRRE FRAIN
Line_1829	I PREESE LET'S GO
Line_1830	NOT SO GREAT
Line_1831	OARDER IN ALH ABOUT THE S AND QUASIS DIFFICALT Y HAT'S EB LIKE THAT AND IT'S MIXTD SOR
Line_1832	THE REASON WHY I THINK THAT IS BARONEY IT'S BECAUSE THAT MAST FINALY CERCING THE WIRE LIKE IT I'S PLOSED UP
Line_1833	WAPPIN SAY THE WETHER REPEATE AND THE FILLMENT WILL GOL DOWN DOWN DOWN AD AND FLTURE
Line_1834	CAUSE ILECDILLILYIRON TIGCHIEESE REA CA N
Line_1835	RE CIRCUITS A  CECRELE WY  THE SERIES SHOD THI HE AT LEAST HAVE TO BE ONES MORE CONNECTED
Line_1836	THE WAY WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS CIRCUIT WARKS HIS VI HAS STUFF AND GON'T STUFF RS STOF ONING WAILE YOU HAVE ONE WIRE AND THEN THE  ASE CAMOUNCATE MON
Line_1837	WE'E HAVING THO THE ENERGY IS JUST BASTING OUT INTO THEIRE BECAUSE IT WAS NUMBERED BY ELECTRICITY INTO
Line_1838	WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE IS NO LIGHT
Line_1839	THEY'ERE ALLE COM MIX IN OU SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT'
Line_1840	IT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT CX IT'LL LIGHT UP IT WON' RE THAT
Line_1841	WHY DO I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE FILLAMENT THERE IS NO LIGHT I MEAN COLLECTR TO TRA
Line_1842	LY  YEA IS THE FILLAMETARY FAND YOUT BURN'S OUT
Line_1843	WELRE THE ELECTRICITY FOUND THAT ONE OTHER CIRCUIT AND WHEN THEY BURNT IT OUT UM IT STOP WORKING
Line_1844	WHAT IS BEAING CHALLANEE AS THEY REPLACE  BETTER E WITH A DIFFERENT NEW ONE
Line_1845	THAT I NOTICE THEHBOKAR REUPLE ONE IS A LITER LANWORK THE POWZIL MAN IS TURNED OUT AND AH
Line_1846	WOUD I KNOWTICE THAT THE ONE LIGHT WILE BIDING UP O THE EOR HAS SPURNT OUT AND IT'S NOT WORAKING FALT
Line_1847	ELL IND HOW AND EVERY FROMHC STOF R JUST TO LIGTE OR AND
Line_1848	THEY ARE CONNECTED INA PARAAL SOPINCIS ORE THEOE A SIDE OR CAN ATL
Line_1849	OES WHAT THAT I BELEYEAHIS OUM ACRTHETIC AND FILL
Line_1850	THENK GET WILE IND A MIX
Line_1851	THE REASON WHY THE ELECTRICHIEET  FLOW STOPS SCOLING IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BUMBP BU BURNS OUT
Line_1852	UPSIDE
Line_1853	I'S UR MAGNETISM
Line_1854	MAGNETTO USE MAGNETISMS
Line_1855	IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONNECT TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO  BE THE OPSIT LIKE NORTH TO SOUTH
Line_1856	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TWO METAL
Line_1857	THAT IS CALLED MAGNETISM
Line_1858	IT HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF METAL IN IT
Line_1859	WHAT'S HAPPONING HERE IS MAGNETS STICKING TO A NEAIL
Line_1860	IT IS STICKING BECAUSE IT CRTAIN KIND YAV METAL
Line_1861	THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO THE WOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAGNET IN IT
Line_1862	THE PAPER CLIP AND I GUESS THAT'S ALL
Line_1863	ONE IS STEEL AND ON THE OTHER ONE IS IRON AGT
Line_1864	THE PAPER FACONE STICKS ON AND THE STEEL NAIL AND THE BLACK WROCK
Line_1865	IF I TRYE TO GET THAT TSTICK IT WILL STAL
Line_1866	IT CONNECTED AND IT STEAID
Line_1867	BECAUSE IT HAS A CERTAIN METAL IN IT
Line_1868	IT MAY HAVE THE SAME THING AS BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_1869	RE'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_1870	I THINK IT WOUL NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME QUODRET
Line_1871	THE FOURCE OF THE MAGNETISM IS NOT GODN'T LET IT STICK TOGETHER
Line_1872	I THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE IS CIRTAON PART OF IT
Line_1873	IF IT'SAN ANANSWR CONNECTS IF IT'S ESTINNES IT DOESN'T AND IF IT'S MENT IT DOESN'T EITHER
Line_1874	WHAT I SIMMLAR IS THESE SIGDS TO A CONNECT
Line_1875	WELL ECININT ATTRACT ENINIS ATTRACT AND AN END AND ASHIMEN DON'T
Line_1876	WHIT'S GOING ONE IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS DOESN'T WANT I LET TO TOUCH THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IT'S NESRYIT'S THE SAME QUADR AND THUT THE OPSI
Line_1877	I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT ALL THE QUAGRONS AND THE ERTH
Line_1878	I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT  SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER WAY AGAINST THE NORTH OR SOUT
Line_1879	ITFCTIONS BY IF YOU PUT A MAGNET UNDER IT AND YOUSE SPIN IT ITS THE POENTY THING WELL KEEP SPINNING AND SPINNING
Line_1880	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET ISM
Line_1881	BUT THE DIFFERENT FORSES AND WHIY THEY PUSHE BACK
Line_1882	WHIT'S GOING ON HERE IS A METAL AND A PIECE OF PAPER CLIP
Line_1883	THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP CAN NOT REP EACH OTHER
Line_1884	ONESE ON THE MEGNET DROP HWEL UNDER THE TAPBLE AND THEN THE MAGNETS STICKED THERE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET S CONDUCTORA UN HOBLED
Line_1885	THE  HORCE IS ABLE TO WHOLD IT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MOVE UNDER STUFF
Line_1886	UNDER A TABLE THAT IS KIND OF WOOD UM PAPER CLIP PAPER ANYTHING REALLY
Line_1887	RE NOTICE IS WHEN IT'S LESS THAT ONES LIKE WHEN IT'S JUST ONE PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN IKE ANET CAN HOLD THE PAPER
Line_1888	IT'S BECAUSE TE MAGNET ISM CAN NOT GO THROUGH ENER PAPERS SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH EGRAFNE PAPER CLIP BT THAT'S
Line_1889	WHAT IT'S GOING ON A THICK PECEOFPAPER IS THE FORCE THAT THE LB CAN NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK  AND THAT THEN IT C BEGINS IT SO B
Line_1890	WHAT WIT'S ALL WTHE IS TOHOTHE MGAD IS HOLDING TO PICK THE CLUP IND HAO
Line_1891	ROIT IS UP THAT THAT WITH THAT AS SING THINGS TO S
Line_1892	THE MAGNET IS RER FROM THE NAIL AND THERE'S THE NAIL LUSES ITS MAGNET
Line_1893	VERTOR CAN SAY ABOUT THAT IS IT'S ANY TIME THE MAGNETS ON IT IT IT REACTS LIKE
Line_1894	GOING ON WHERE JU SEE THE SOMETHING IN A DREAM E LAST NIGH
Line_1895	WHAT DO YOU MEAN AND SEE THE SAME PICTURE
Line_1896	MORE SORING THE ANMOVIY BECAUSE ALLY SEE IS THE SAME THING WITH THE MAGNET THEN NA ON THE PAPER  CLIP
Line_1897	FI SEE IS A MAGNET AND THEN NAIL AND IT'S FORSE KEEP T GOING ON TO THE MAGNET THAT'S ALL I SEE
Line_1898	WHEN ITS TO MAKE IT ON IT IT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP BUT WHEN ITS NOT IT CAN NOT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1899	WHAT IS HAPPONING IS THE MAGNETISM CRESSES OFF AND BECAUSE THE MAGNET IS MAKING IT JOUSTY
Line_1900	IT CAN BECAUSE THE MEGNRIC CHATAM FOR
Line_1901	I THINK WHAT ASSURING US IS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_1902	MORTAL SHOPAN IS ITS STUCKING TO A NAIL AND IT'CONNECTED PAPERS
Line_1903	THE MAGNET IS JAPER DTHER CLIP ITS ON TOP AND IT GLOWES IT AROUT
Line_1904	THE FORCE WASN'T THE STRONG ENOUGH
Line_1905	ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TWO MAGNETS
Line_1906	WHAT  PAPII IS LIKE M PRESSING THE WASHERS GO IN
Line_1907	AS I'M TRYING WHEN IT GOT UP TO HOW MANY WASHERS IT COULD GO UP TO THE IT BROKE IT THE FALT
Line_1908	IT'S GOING ON HERE FOR WHEN IT PUTS PEACHERS WHEN I ATHE MAGNET GETS TALLER BUT THE MAGNETAYS TO TUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_1909	THAT'S ALL THE GOOD IS TO USE THE MAGNET TO SOME OF THE ULLY IS FOURSHED ANOW
Line_1910	OR WETHE IT DOESN'T MAKES THE MOUT IT MAKES THE AMOUNT TALLER AND THAT HELPS IT MAKES IT EVEN
Line_1911	THERE IS SPREADDING A POTER
Line_1912	WHEN THEIT JUST ENTERD HEN WASHEIT BROKE GETS FAL BECAUSE OF THEBECAUSE OF THE SPACERS
Line_1913	THE FOURCE OF THE MAGNETS BIZORNESS WAS TO HAVE THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WAUN'T PLJICK IN IT
Line_1914	BUT IT DOESN'T  MIX A FRIST WEAKR
Line_1915	THE FOR THE SPACERS MADE THE FOURCE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER
Line_1916	UH THAT THE ONES BEE HERE A ICK NIGHTS NO Y WASHERS TO BREAKE IT
Line_1917	UMBY IT FORCE
Line_1918	I NEEDED THREE
Line_1919	IT CAUSE BIGGER AND THEN IT GOES SMALLER
Line_1920	WAT IT DOESN'T MIX A R CAN IT WEAERW CAREAWE CON ERVBING STRONG IT AND USUALLY THE FOUR SEE
Line_1921	SCIENT
Line_1922	U IT'S ALL ABOU CIRCUIT SAND
Line_1923	WI THE VET WIRE IS RAPPED ABOUNT THE TOP FRONT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEARE THE UM ELECTRICITY AND THE ENERGY CUEP UP THE
Line_1924	M WHAT'S IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THE SPARK COULD GO THROUGH THE FROUN BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WEIGH BACK IT WON'T BE ABL TO GET TRIP TO GET THE MAGNET
Line_1925	THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS A MAGNEGATIVE FORCE
Line_1926	IT ACTS A MAGNET AN CALECCAT PICK UP ANYTHING THAT'S HIRE STICK
Line_1927	WHAT HAPPEN LESE TO SO THE ENERGY IT GOES
Line_1928	WHAT THAT RELATES HIS MIXTURES AIN
Line_1929	WE LEARNED ABOUT H IT DON'T BE  GUM YOU'RE GET AFFECTED AND I DON'T WEIG
Line_1930	THIS WHEN IT'S ENOPEEIN CIRCUIT THE MAGNETIC FORCE M AND CONNECT TO IT THE WASHERS BECAUSE ITIT HAS NO COMPALAT TO THE WIRES
Line_1931	MENNERAL AND ELECTROL MAGNETS THE FOURCE OF THE CIRCUIT IS SOLBEUTE
Line_1932	THE CIRCUIT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CIRCUITS AND HOW IT'S M AND HOW IT'S PUT UP
Line_1933	UH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1934	MAKES ME THINK THAT S BECAUSE THE WIRE ELECTRICITY ITS GOING THROUGH UM TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRE MIXID TO GET IT THE MAGNETIC FORS
Line_1935	WE THEY HAVEPEEN THAT THE RIVER AND THE WIRES S IT HAS TO LEAST CONNECT SOME TO ATLEAST DO SOMETHING  IT
Line_1936	THE WIRES WAPPED AROUND A RIVENT
Line_1937	H WHAT THE PURANT IS THERE IS ASIPAL TO BE ANY OPEN CIRCUIT UH ULH IT HAS TO BE CLOSEERCUIT EVERYTH
Line_1938	WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT IT CONNECTS THE WASHERS STICK TO IT WHEN IT'S AN OPEN TIRCUIT IT DOESN'T
Line_1939	WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY RAPPING THE WIRE MORE ABOUT THE VBED
Line_1940	WELL THE MORE YOU HAPP IT AROUND THE MORE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY IT GETS POARC
Line_1941	WHAT I JUSDISCOVERED IS WHEN I PUT ORE RAPPING ONRE OF THE WIRE ABROUND IT MORE WASHER STICK TO IT
Line_1942	WHE WHEN IT'LL CREAS MORE THE LIGHTS HAS MORE THERE IS UP ORE
Line_1943	THE MORE  UM WELL IT YOU HAVE WHAT'S HAPORDAY AS THE STRENGTH IS IT'S GETTING THE MORE FORCE INTO IT
Line_1944	AWDO RELATES THIS I
Line_1945	WHEN YOU INCREASE MORAL BATTERIES U LIKE LIKE THEIG LIKE WHEN I RAPPED AROUND ON URVINTS IT PICKED UP THIRTY WASHES CAS TWO BATTERE
Line_1946	THIT'S ATTATCHED TO THIRTY
Line_1947	WHEN I MINESSE THE LIGNE TO SEVERN A MAURE TEN ONECSE UM I 'VNT SAY BEFORE I ONLY PICKED UP THREE AND NOW IT JUST PICKED UP FIVE
Line_1948	WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU'RE OARNAR TO MAKE YOUR ELECTRO MAGNET TROUMMETS ADDMARE BATTERIES FACING POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_1949	THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOW TWO D CELLS WORK WITH THE VERSE WHEN D CELL AND HOW MUCH ENERGY IT GIVES LEAITER GOES UP TO
Line_1950	BUT IT STEAND ABOUT A MELAGRAFF IS NUMBERS
Line_1951	THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHT BUB UM CONSERTS T HUMAN Y

Line_1955	BY THEY REFLECTIVE HOW IT REACTS
Line_1956	LIKE A MERIC SOMETIMES REFLECTING GO TO THE CENTAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_1957	WHAT I KNOW IS CERTAN LIGHT BULBS LIGHT ARDER AND SOME FOCA IN ONE SPOT
Line_1958	WY AND I CAUD PUT THOME THING UN THE LIGHT REFLEXTS OFF THE CASHOD
Line_1959	THEY BAS OFF AND WECOLECT TO OTHER STUFF
Line_1960	IT BOUNSES OFF AND REPLEX TRMETORS THINK
Line_1961	BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT REFLECTEDING ALL THE MAR WHICH GIVES HIM SO HE CAUND RSEE HIMSELF OF HIS REFLECTION
Line_1962	THE STICKH IS REFLECTING IN THE SUNLIGHT TIMEND WOVING THE RAL AND IT SHOWES IT ON THE WATER

Line_1973	SEVEN IT LOOKS
Line_1974	THE LIGHT IS RIFFTED INK A PRALING PBULB
Line_1975	TURNING TO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Line_1976	THE LIGHT KEEPS ON BASHING NOFH  OBJECT BUT THE COLOR BLUE
Line_1977	UM IT'S RECECTING OFH IS A BLUE OR APSOLTIER
Line_1978	HNEAN HAVE THE THES OBSTRUCTION OF THE LIRLE
Line_1979	IT IT TURNS INTO THE BUL
Line_1980	IT'S HAIRING SOME TWLONG YATA THOU LAGN
Line_1981	ALSO THE LIGHT IS ERE BECAUSE I FOUR THE L
Line_1982	IT'S ING BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING OFF AND TURNING INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR AND IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGEING INTO YEALA INSTEAD OF BLUE
Line_1983	IT WAS  ANDE AN Y CAOANDSOLVIN THERA TA TO BE RED
Line_1984	WE WELL HAVE A REFLECTION THAT THEY C E A THATS SO
Line_1985	YHAT CHANGE THE SCAIL THA FIL TURNIT
Line_1986	YES THE REFLECTION IT'S A COLOR
Line_1987	THE REFLEXTORN WAS USED TO A MIXING THE COLOR
Line_1988	UM IT WILLE TENDER
Line_1989	UM IT'S NOT USE TO THE COLOR BECAUSE IT HAS GREEN LIME AND IT'S POSTYGREEN NOT RED OR BLUE
Line_1990	BECAUSE IT STOPPS THE COLOR ITS USED TO
Line_1991	IT WON'T GO BECAUSE IT SAYS RAT OR IT MUST BE RED
Line_1992	ALEAN THE RED
Line_1993	I AM DOING FIN HOW ARE YOU
Line_1994	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON HOW TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS WITH WIRES AND BATTERYE
Line_1995	TWO GREEN WIRES ONE D CELL BATTERY AND ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1996	BATTERIES ARE A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT IT STORES ELECTRICITY
Line_1997	WIRES MAKE A CIRCUIT CLOSED
Line_1998	THE JERMAN OPEN CIRCUIT INTO A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1999	THAT THEY CONDUCT SORCE OF ELECTRICITY TOTHE TO THE BATTERY
Line_2000	I THINK ELECTRICITY TRAVELS AND WI
Line_2001	WIRES CARRY OPEN CIRCUITT
Line_2002	LIGHT BULBS AVE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_2003	A LIGHT BULB HAS EAGHT D
Line_2004	I THINK IT MEANS TOFOR A LIGHT BULB TO BE A RECEIVER THAT IT MEANS LIKE A RECEEVES ELECTRICIGITY TO LIGHT UP T
Line_2005	THAT THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THETHE CASING WIRES THE LIGHT BUL
Line_2006	LIKE I SEE I SEE ELECTRICITY TRAM
Line_2007	ELECTRICITY FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE L
Line_2008	THE ELECTRICITY IS BLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SCIL

Line_2011	THE BLUE DOESN' PRESENT THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB  BACK INTO THE BANER
Line_2012	THE D CELL BATTERY SLIPED OVER
Line_2013	CIRE BULS
Line_2014	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_2015	THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE CASING WIRE SO THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP INTO THE FITLL
Line_2016	I THINK THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT IF YOU TOUCHE THE BOTH OF THE WIRES TO THE BACE
Line_2017	THAT WHEN EVERY TIME THE WIRE TOUCHES THE CASING WIRE THE BULB LIGHTS AND WHEN BOTH OF THE WIRES TOUCHE THE BACE IT DOESN'T OW
Line_2018	IT'S LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT
Line_2019	THE FLAG IS SPITTING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2020	THE BRANTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE
Line_2021	THE BATTERY GIVES THE MOTOR ENERGY AND MAKES THE MHOTOR STICK
Line_2022	IT HAS A SWITCH MAKING E MOTOR STOP
Line_2023	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOST BUDS
Line_2024	IT CONNECTS TO THE WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPING
Line_2025	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_2026	THE MOTOR IS ON IT MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
Line_2027	THE WHOLE CIRCUIT BECOMES
Line_2028	THE SWITCH HAS TO TTOUCH THE WIRE
Line_2029	THE MOTOR STOPS AND MOVE
Line_2030	THE SWITCH IS IN IT NHOT CLOSED
Line_2031	THE ELECTRICITY HASTICK FROWSE TO WIRE TO THE BATTERY AND THEN TO THE MOTR
Line_2032	WHEN THEY GET SOLAR ENERGY THEY POWER SO
Line_2033	SUNLIGHT IS TRAVELING TO THE TO THE SOLAR PANEL INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAD SPIN
Line_2034	THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO RECEIVE ENERGY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKE IT SPIN
Line_2035	THE SOLAR PENEL IS RECEIVING SUNMLIGHT
Line_2036	THE FLAG WOULD STOP SPINNIN
Line_2037	WHEN TEY CLICK ON THE SUN THE LA TRS SPINING AGAIN
Line_2038	THE SOLAR FUL IS NOT RECEIVING ENNER A EANY ENERGY AND THE STOFPPING THE MOTOAR M SPAIN
Line_2039	IT IS SHOWING ENERGY TRANSFORIMNG FROM THE WIRE TO THE SMEAL
Line_2040	THEY'RE DOING FIN PIN
Line_2041	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO BILD PARALLEL ON SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2042	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2043	THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH POWER BY ONE D CELL BATTERY
Line_2044	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_2045	THE LIGHT BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_2046	IMER
Line_2047	COMES IT COMES AHE
Line_2048	DOCODCODDRODS OVER TO CHONE
Line_2049	WA
Line_2050	ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACCK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2051	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS TWO PATHWAY
Line_2052	THE SERIES CIRCUIT ON THE LEFT IS GOODDING ITS GODING
Line_2053	BODY THE WHUNGOUBUS HAD TO PULCHUTHD AND TUTA SCLAIRIES A CLI UN GOREE
Line_2054	BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE LIGHT BULB HAS TO STOP AND GO WHEND IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT OULK GET DIMMER
Line_2055	THE WIRES HAVE TO DOW ENERGY HAS TO TRAVEL LONGER THEN IT WILL SUPPORT
Line_2056	BATTERIES
Line_2057	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT DONST HAVE TO COUAL THAT
Line_2058	I AM DOING
Line_2059	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING TO SOLVE THE STREEMS OF LIGHTPRB
Line_2060	IT HA A CARE L STRE TO LIGHTS RO STRENGS OF WIGTE
Line_2061	THE BULB IS NOT LIGHTING BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2062	N SHIGD MANE
Line_2063	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OFF
Line_2064	THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING ANYMORE
Line_2065	BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE MORE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULBAN AND THEY BOTH DON'
Line_2066	TOP
Line_2067	THE FIRST LIGHT BULB BRIGHTS OUT AND NOH MORE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER
Line_2068	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOW
Line_2069	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2070	THE OTHER BULB STADS SLIGHT LIT BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IS CONNECTED TO TH
Line_2071	THE OTHER BULBS TANDS LIT

Line_2140	I SEE ALL SEVEN COLORS OF THE RAIN
Line_2141	IT MAKES AVERIG COLORS OF THE
Line_2142	I THINK THERE ARE SEVEN COLORS N
Line_2143	THE WHIHTE LIGHE IS GETTING OBSORBED TO THE WHIGHTE PART OF THE BULLB AND THE REST OF THE WHIGHE LITTER IS REFLECTING IG
Line_2144	BECAUSE IT FOLLOW'S DOWN
Line_2145	THE WHIGHT LIGHT GETS TURNED  TO BLUE LIGHT AND THE WHIHT PART OF THE BULB GETS OBSORBED
Line_2146	THE WHIGHT LIGHT IT'S GETTING OBSORBED BY THE WHIGHT PART OF THE BULB AND THE REST OF THE BLUE ART OF THE BULB IS GETTING WITH FLAT
Line_2147	GOOD TO BOSOME MONNE GET THE BOSSO
Line_2148	THE WHIGHT LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE AND THEN MAKES THE BUB BLUE AND THE WHIGHT POT STICKS WHIGT
Line_2149	THE WIGHE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF THE YELLOW BULLB IT IS MAKING THE BULL YEL
Line_2150	BULLS ARE BORNED TO PLAY WITH AND THE BULL IS MAKING IT YELLOW BECAUSE THE WAIRE IS PECHING ON IT
Line_2151	BULL MAKES ELLOW AND THEN BULL MAKES IT WHIGHT BECAUSE A WHITE SPOT AND YELLOWS
Line_2152	THE PLATFORM IS TURNING ON TO BLUD AND BRED IS TURNING CAY SHI
Line_2153	THE BOLM TURNS GREEN
Line_2154	THE BULTERND GREEM BECAUSE THE YELLOW LIGHT MAKES THA BLUE FILTER INTO BLUE LIGHT AND THE YEALLOW BULJE
Line_2155	GHTONLY THE GREEN LIGHT WILL MAKE THE LIGHMEN
Line_2156	THE LIGHT ISN'T REFLECTING OFF IT AND THE LIGHT IS TRN
Line_2157	WHEN YOU SHINE THE LIGHT ON THE BRICK IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2158	YOU WOULD SIGHT THE RED LIGHT ONLEY
Line_2159	HEY WE CALLED THEM A D CELL BATTERY A BATTERY AND  ENERGY WIRE
Line_2160	BATTERIES PRODUCE ENERGY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS POWER AND MOVE
Line_2161	THE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT TRAVEL ENERGY THROUGH THEM TO GIVE POWER TO AN OBJECT THAT IT IS TO
Line_2162	IN A CIRCUIT WIRES CARRY ENERGY
Line_2163	SO THE BATTERY PA GETS ITS POWER AND IT LIGHT SO THE BATTERY IS LIKE A LIGHT
Line_2164	A RECEIVER MEANS IT IS GETTING AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING FROM ANYTHGIN
Line_2165	TO ME IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S TRAVELING TO THE LIGHT FROM BECAUSE OF A WIDE ELECTRICITY WIRE
Line_2166	THE NEGATVE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2167	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ENERGY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2168	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2169	I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STARTED TO GO THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS KLOKQUISED
Line_2170	UH DIRECTION OF FLOW TURNS THE OTHER WY
Line_2171	THIS FALWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_2172	I NOTICE THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS WORKING BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
Line_2173	I THINK THAT THE ENERGY WOULD GO JUST GO NOWERE AND IT WOULD STOP AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT
Line_2174	I NOTICED THAT AT FIRST THE BULB DID NOT LIGHT AND WHEN WE CLICKED THE BUTAN THAT THE WITH THE WIRE MOVED THEN IT THE LIGHT BUB D
Line_2175	IN SCIENCE LEATLY WE HAVE BEEN DOING CLOSE CIRCUITS AND OPEN CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_2176	IT'S MOVEIT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THAT IT MEANS TO MOVE
Line_2177	IT MUST GET ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY SO THWILL MO
Line_2178	THAT IT MUST GET ENERGY SO IT MU
Line_2179	THE BATTERY IS TRANSFERING IT'S ENERGY AND THEN IT MOVES SO THAT IT WE
Line_2180	NOTICE THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER WIRE SO IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY JUST STOPS SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_2181	IS THAT THERE IS ENERGY TRAVELING FROM BOTH THE NEGATIE AND THE POSTRIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERI SWITCH  WAS UP STICKG AND THEN A READAL T
Line_2182	I NOTICE THAT I DON'T
Line_2183	IT HAS TO HAVE LIGHT FROM THE SUN SO THAT IT WILL MOVE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO LIGHT IT HAS NO ENERGY TO TRAVEL THROUGH IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR MO
Line_2184	FLAG IS TURNING IT MEANS THAT IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOLAR PANEL NO SOLAR PANEL GETS ITS ENERGIES FROM THE SUN AND THEN IT JUST LIKE MOS THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_2185	I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS SAVING
Line_2186	THINK CAN IT CAN STILL PRODUCE ENERGY ON A CLOUDY DAY I JUST THINK IT WON'T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS ON THE BRIGHT AND SUNY
Line_2187	THE FLAG WILL START TO MOVE BECAUSE IT IS GETTING ENERGY THROUGH THE SOL CELL AND THEN IT IT JUST MOVES AND IT GOES
Line_2188	MAKES THE FLAG BLOUWEAL WEL WEWEL
Line_2189	IT'S THAT WHEN THERE IS NO SIN THAT THE FLAG WILL NOT MOVE
Line_2190	THAT THERE IS NO ENERGY TRAVELING FROM THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN BUBBUBBUBBBBBBLACK HAT
Line_2191	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABT INTHERE  JUST CEIND IN SOLATORS AND INS E THAT
Line_2192	HAVING CONDUCT THIS HELPS SEND ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR SO THEN IT'S ABLE TO SPIN THE FLAG R
Line_2193	IN THE CIRCUIT A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY TO POWER A MOTOR
Line_2194	CONDUCTORS ARE WHAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE SO THEN AGAINST THE MOTOR POWER TO SPIT
Line_2195	GOOD
Line_2196	WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_2197	FOUND OUT THAT THE BRASS RING WORKS
Line_2198	IT WIT'S AN INSULATOR IN IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THE AN INSULATOR WILL NOT LET ENERGY FLOW THROUGH OR TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_2199	THIS THAT THI PAPER CLIP IS A CONDUCTOR AND ENERGY CAN IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH IT
Line_2200	CONDUCTORS ARE OBJECTS THAT OUR ENERGY IS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THEM WITH AND THE MOTOR WILL STILL SPIN IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER WIRE
Line_2201	WE HAVE BI ABOUT PRESENT ENERGY
Line_2202	BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO MAKE STUFF
Line_2203	I DON'T KNOW WHAT FIELDS AR
Line_2204	A CANDLE ITS ON FIRE AND IT RELATES TO ENERGY BECAUSE IT IS ENERGY
Line_2205	OBSERVE WHEN I SEE O CANNOT BURN TIPE
Line_2206	BURNING CANDLE GIVES OFF ENERGY
Line_2207	NO I DO NOT HEARE ANYTHING WHEN A CANDLE BRN
Line_2208	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER BECAUSE IT IS FEUL AND IT IS GETTING USED
Line_2209	YOU CAN SEE HEATOR YOU CAN FIEL HEAT
Line_2210	ENERGY IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THEY ARE USING THEIR ENERGY FROM THEIR BODY TO PET THE DRUM
Line_2211	SHE IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING ENERGY FROM HER APPLE AND THEN SHE IS USING HER ENERGY ON HER WALK
Line_2212	YES YOU CAN HEARE THE DRUMS BEING PLAYIED BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INSTRMENT AND THEY ARE MADE TO MAKE NOISE
Line_2213	WE SEE A LAW OF SOURCES OF ENERGY
Line_2214	I SEE SOLAR PANELS APPLES BARTREE PIECES COAL AND FEW
Line_2215	THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BAD BECAUSE WE ARE RELEACING BADD GASSIS INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATHE IN THAT AIR
Line_2216	WE IT MAKES THE AIR ALF IT IT GIVES OFF BAD GASSIS TO THE AIR AND WE BREATH IN THAT AIR
Line_2217	IT IS ALL DARK AND SMOKY
Line_2218	I SEE DIFFERENT FUELD SOURCES I SEE GOOD ONES AND BAD ONES
Line_2219	THEY ARE SIMMILAR BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT LEAVING BAD GASSIES IN THE AIR
Line_2220	THEY BOTH PRODUCE ENERGY AND THEY DO NOT AND NEETHER OF THEM PPRODUCE BAD GASSIS INTO THE A
Line_2221	THEY ARE SIMMLAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH DO LEAVE BAG ASSIS IN THE AIR AND THEY THEY ARE BOTH ENERGY SOURCES
Line_2222	I THINK THAT CACOAL AND GASS ONE DAY WILL RUN OUT AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE LESF TO
Line_2223	THEY WILL HAVE BAD BAD EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY PULLUT BAD GASSIS INTO THE AIR AND WE BREATH IN THAT AIR
Line_2224	RENEWABLE ENERGY CIRCHES ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ONE DAY THAT WE ONLY HAVE THEM NOW
Line_2225	I AM DOING GOOD
Line_2226	WE HAVE BEEN DOING BILDING SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_2227	ELECTRICITY CIRCUITS ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_2228	SORT THE BULB TO LIGHT THE THE WIRES ARE FLEDTING ENERGYS FROM THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE GO INTO THE THE LIGHT BUL
Line_2229	TO GET ENERGY FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BU U THE D CELL SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
Line_2230	IT IS GETING ENERGY AD OT TRIVE AS LICO PATHWAY AND THEN IT
Line_2231	UM O YEAH YEAT BUB YEAT BU
Line_2232	IN A SERIES CIRCUIT PATHWAYS THERE CAN BE AS MANY AS TO UP TO AS MANY AS A MILIAN
Line_2233	AND MORE LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULBS WELL GET TE
Line_2234	OUR D CELLS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS GET LIGHTER UND THEN WE BRIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY
Line_2235	IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE WE HAVE BEEN BILDING PARALLEL CR
Line_2236	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE UM THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM ONE LIGHT
Line_2237	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE D CELL BETTER
Line_2238	D THERE ARE FORE PATHWAY
Line_2239	I OBSERVED ENERGY S MOVEI
Line_2240	COMPARED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE BRIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT
Line_2241	BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING MORE LIKE CHUMS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D CELL YOU'LL GET MORE D
Line_2242	WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_2243	I REMEMBER THAT IT ALWAYS GOES LIKE IN ONE SIDE AND IT COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2244	IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE PATHTHEY OR TWO PATHWAYS OR MORE IT MATTERS HOW MANY LIKE WELLT
Line_2245	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLVING
Line_2246	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE STRINGS OF LIGHT
Line_2247	UM TO USE UM YOU CAN USE SOMETHING THAT IS HAT
Line_2248	UM YOU CAN USE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WILL A ENERGY FLOW THROUGH IT THAT CAN COMPLETE THIS
Line_2249	BECAUSE THE I THINK THAT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THAT LIKE LIGHT BULB SO IT DOESN'T KEEP FLOWIN
Line_2250	THE LIGHT BULB THAT IS BROKE AND THE FILLAMENT IS BROKEN SOTHA THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_2251	THE ENERGY STOPS RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE FILM BROKE SO THE ENERGY CAN NOT KEEP FLOWING THROUGH THE
Line_2252	SO THE FILLAMENT BRAKES IT ON ONE OF EITHER OF THE LIGHT BUL
Line_2253	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2254	WE HAVE ALSO SEIN UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PARALLEL
Line_2255	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_2256	UM ONLY A NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH PO WILL STICK TOGETHER
Line_2257	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRI
Line_2258	THE NAIL ARE THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT NAIL IS IRON
Line_2259	THEN NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGOR THEN NAIL IS STEEL OR IRON SO SO THE MAGNET ATTRACTS IT
Line_2260	UMLY IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_2261	MAGNET STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR S
Line_2262	A NAIL MUST BE MADE OF ALUMINIM
Line_2263	IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNET ONLY ATTRACTS CERTAIN KIND OF METALS AND THE OTHER NAIL MUST BE ALUMINIUM SO IT IS NOT ATTRACTING TO THE MET
Line_2264	IT IS USTEEL OR IRON THAT WILL ATTRACT TO THE MAGNET
Line_2265	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_2266	I THINK THAT THE STEEL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE ALUMINIUM IS LIKE NOT STRONG MET
Line_2267	I NOTICE THAT ONLY USUALLY THE METALS ON OUR OBJECTS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2268	I THINK IT HAS STEEL OR IRON
Line_2269	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_2270	STICK
Line_2271	I THINK THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STIC
Line_2272	UM WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS AND TRRAC
Line_2273	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE EITHER TWO NORTH POLES OR SOUTH POLES TRASING EACH OTHER
Line_2274	UH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO SOUTH POLES ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER AND THE TWO NUSTPULES AN REPELLING EACH OTHER MAN
Line_2275	THEY UM LIKE RUN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2276	THE MAGNETS ARE REREPELLING EACH OTHER THEEN PUSHING AWAY FROM EACH
Line_2277	I THINK THIS PIXTURE IS BECAU
Line_2278	SHE'S TRYING TO SEE WHICH DIRECTION SHE IS GOING
Line_2279	AND BECAUSE THE MAGNETS MAKE THE COMPESS NO WHICH WEIYGH THE'RE FACING
Line_2280	IT IS BECAUSE THE MY DICK
Line_2281	THE NAIL IS OUR TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_2282	OH IT WAS RECORDING ME
Line_2283	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_2284	THE MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN
Line_2285	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MAGNETIC FOURCE IS WEAKER
Line_2286	THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_2287	UM THEY DO NOT HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH FOURCE TO ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TO FAR APART
Line_2288	THE AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT YOU NEED GETS SMALLER
Line_2289	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_2290	AN ELECTRO MAGNET IS A MAGNET THAT HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_2291	THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUNT THE RIVET
Line_2292	I NOTICE THAT IS A CLOSE CIRCUIT AND IT INCLOUDES THE SWITCH BUT IT ALSO HAS A D CELL YOU HAVE ENERGY
Line_2293	WITH OUT THE ENERGY THEN IT WILL NOT BE AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNET AND THE RIVET WILL NOT ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_2294	YOU NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY STOPS UM AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2295	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN THE ENERGY WILL JUST STOP
Line_2296	THE ENERGY STOPS AND THE YOU MAGNET IS NOT ABLE TO ATTRACT ANYTHING ANYMORE
Line_2297	UM THE FLOW THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS BECAUSETHERE IS NO WER FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO
Line_2298	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING AND IT IS GIVING UM ENERGY TO THE MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2299	I THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE WASHERS
Line_2300	IT GOOD
Line_2301	THAT IS IT ISN'T A COMBNATION OF ELECTRICITY AND A MAGNET
Line_2302	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIREING AROUND THE MAGNET TO MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_2303	THE THE WIRE IS DRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET AND IT ATTRACTS THE WASHERS
Line_2304	IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2305	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE LETRO MAGNET IS AIBLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2306	YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS NO WASHE WASHERS ATTATCHING BECAUSE  IT IS NOT IN THE CL A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2307	IT DOES BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGER AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS RAPPING AROUND THE RIVET
Line_2308	YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE BOTTOME THAT IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU RAP THE WIRES AROUND TEEL RIVET
Line_2309	IF YOU ADD MORE WIRERAPS YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2310	CHANGES BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING AROUND THE RIVET AND IT IS GETTING MORE ENERGY SO IT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE WASHERS
Line_2311	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHI AND HOW IT TRAVELES
Line_2312	BECAUSE THIS LIGHT IS UMREFLECTING
Line_2313	YOU CAN IT REFLECT IT CAN REFLECT AND KEEP  CAN REFLECT ON TO SOMETHING
Line_2314	THE LIGHT IS TURNING ON ENOFF AND TS REFLECTING
Line_2315	UM WITH OUT IT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DARK
Line_2316	IT UM REFLECTS OFF ON UM SOMETHINGS BUT SOMETHINGS IT CAN NOT REFLECT AS WEL
Line_2317	IT REFLECTS OFF THE OBJECTS THAT IT HITS IN THE ROM
Line_2318	YOU OBSERVE THE LIGHT REFLECT
Line_2319	M THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING AND IT IS BOUNCING BACK AT THE STUDENT
Line_2320	IT CAN KEEP REFLECTING IF IF I IS POSITION DRY AND THE LIGHT IT IS STRONG ENOUGH
Line_2321	I THINK THE FLASH LIGHT WILL HIT THE BOTTOM LEFT AND THE COURNER STARE BECAUSE OF HOW
Line_2322	THE UM PENCILS AREFLECTING BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS TWO PENCILS IN THE WATER BUT THER REALLY IS ONLY ONE
Line_2323	HE NOTICED THAT UM THE PENCIL REFLECTS OFF THE GLASS
Line_2324	AND THE GLASS WITH WATER IN IT IT IS REFLECTING AND THE WITH THE GLASS WITH AIR NO THING IS HAPPENING
Line_2325	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT IS U CAN XPLAIN TO DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2326	IT CAN COME FROM ENERGY
Line_2327	YOU CAN SEE THAT THE WIGHT LIGHT MAKES THE CANDLE GREEN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE ANY COL
Line_2328	YOU NOTICE THAT  THE PRISOM SPRITS SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE WHIGHT AND SO DIFFERENT  FORMS
Line_2329	SEE THAT THE PRISUM SPLITS UP THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE WHIGHT
Line_2330	UM YOU CAN SEE THAT IS PUT'S INTO SIX DIFFERENT COLORS AND IT IS THE COLORS OF THE ROE
Line_2331	COULD NOTICE THAT UM IN A LIGHT BULB ALL THE COLORS ARE WHIGHT AND WHEN IT SWITCH INTO THE PRELA PRISM IT SPLITS INTO DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_2332	I THINK THAT SIX DIFFERENT COLORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE WHIGHT LIGHT
Line_2333	YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS UM GOING TOWARDS THE BULLB THAT IT IS WHIGHT LIGHT AND WHEN IT REFLECTS THE BULB THE LIGHT IS BLUE THONT REFLECT
Line_2334	UM THAT EVERY COLOR IS AT WHIGHT IS ATTRACTING TO THE YELLOW BULLB AND YELLOW IS REFLECTING OFF THE BULB
Line_2335	THAT UM THE WHIGHT LIGHT IS ATTRACTING THE BULB AND UM THE YELLOW LIGHT REFLEXED OFF THE YELLOW
Line_2336	UM YOU NOTICE THAT WHIGHT LIGHT IS HEADDING THE BU IN YELLOW LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF ROM THE B
Line_2337	THAT ON THE BLUE BALL BLUE LIGHT WOULD REFLECT IT AND ON THE YELLOW BALL YELLOW LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
Line_2338	YOU NOTICE THAT DIFFERENT OBJECT CAN TURNING TO DIFFERENT COLORS DIPENDING ON WHICH COLOR THE OBJECT IS
Line_2339	THE YELLOW BULB CHANGES INTO A DIFFERENT COLOR BECAUSE DIFFERENT LIGHT IS GOING TOWARDS
Line_2340	COLOR CHANGED AND IF IT IS A DIFFERENT OBJECT AND IT WILL NOT CHANGE INTO THAT COLOR IF IT IS A CERTAIN COLOR OBJEC
Line_2341	YOU THINK THAT ONLY SOME UM COLORS LIGHT WILL CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE LIGNE
Line_2342	THES IT HAS YOU HAVE EVERY OTHER COLOR BESIDES GREEN UM TOU TURN THE LIKE GREEN
Line_2343	THE COLOR RED BECAUSE UM THE BRICK IS RED
Line_2344	UM IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM IT DOES NOT NEED THAT COLOR
Line_2345	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN SCIENCE ENERGY
Line_2346	A BETTERH A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_2347	D CELL BRY WIRES AND UH LIGHT BUL
Line_2348	U THE WIRES COULD CONNECT TO ALIGHTVERRY I MEAN TO LIGHT BULB AND U SHINE WITH THE PODERY
Line_2349	WIER PASTHWAY
Line_2350	THE BATTERIES HAVE ENERGY AND THEN O THEY CAN MAKE THINGS WORK
Line_2351	YOU COULD LIGHT UP ANYTN
Line_2352	THE SOURCE UH COULD GET ENERGY
Line_2353	THE PASST HAS A THINK
Line_2354	WIRES CARRY IN A CIRCUIT IS THEENGS THAT COULD CARRY US IN
Line_2355	IGTLIGT PUPS COULD MAKE ANYTHING SHRI
Line_2356	IT MEANS THAT WE T LIGHT ALMOST ANYTHING
Line_2357	YOU COULD PUT  SOME OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT AND THE BATERY TO MAKE IT SHIGH
Line_2358	I SEE UM THE WIRES ARE TROUCHING THE LIGHT BUP AND IT ABOUT THE BELD TO MAKE THEY LIGHT UP
Line_2359	UM ENERGY FROMS A BROUNDY IT'S GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO WERE
Line_2360	IF YOU USE D CELL ENERGY WITH THE WIRES THE WIES WILL GET ENERGY TO IT LIKE PUL
Line_2361	THE POSITIVE SIDE UM GETS THE ENERGY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDES UM  GIVE HIS ENERGY TO ITH LIGHT
Line_2362	THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES SO LIKE  AN THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE WITH THE WIRE
Line_2363	IT BL THOTS REPRESZENTS THE ENERGY COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_2364	LOWES THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE TO GO TO A NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2365	ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS WITH THE POSITIVE
Line_2366	THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_2367	IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE UM ONE  ONE WIRE HAS BE CONNECTED TO THE CA
Line_2368	THEY WON'T WORK IF THEY'RE ON THE BACE BUT IF THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WOULD WORK
Line_2369	IT MEANS THAT THE YOU
Line_2370	ENERGY HAS TO METTL THROUGH THEIRES TO THE MUT
Line_2371	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2372	IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2373	THE MOTOR WORKS
Line_2374	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK
Line_2375	WHEN IT'S OPEN THE MOTOR DOESN'T MOVE BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_2376	IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO WRK
Line_2377	THE MOTOR DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPEN CIRCUI
Line_2378	THE CSUN HITS LITTLE SOLAR PANEL IS ENDED A SOLA PANELS GET ENERGY TOWORK
Line_2379	THAT MEANS THAT IT S WORKING SO THERE S A CO
Line_2380	UH BECAUSE THE ENERGY GOSE
Line_2381	THE FLAG WON'T MOVE BECAUSE THE SOLAR PENNELRS NADE SUNLIGHT
Line_2382	THE SOLAR PANELS GET ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES TO THE MOTOR
Line_2383	THE MOWETOR IS SCORCKY
Line_2384	THE MOERAR WORKH BECAUSE OF THE SALT
Line_2385	THE SOLAR PONORS ARE ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM THE
Line_2386	WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SPLIT
Line_2387	THERE IS IT BETTERNEY WIRES A MOTAR A NAIL AND A SWIF
Line_2388	SWITCH AND THE NAIL
Line_2389	WRISTED PAPER CLIPS MOTOR SE WORKHING
Line_2390	WITH THE SPUNGENT WON'T WARK
Line_2391	SOLTH ARE MADE RA COPPER ION
Line_2392	SOME OF THEM MORAL
Line_2393	THE MOTOR IS N'T WORKING BECAUSE STICK IS WOOD
Line_2394	IT HAS IN CLOSED CIRCUIT P IT HAS WOOD BUT NOT STEEL THE RIGH
Line_2395	IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S RO
Line_2396	IT IT IS NOT  LIKE THE OTHERS
Line_2397	BECAUSE THE SRAW IS RBER
Line_2398	THE BRASS SWING GREEN THATWOOD PILL JUST LIKE COPPER AND COPPER LIKE METAL
Line_2399	THE CIRCUIT STOPS THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_2400	WE SCETL ENERGY UM WE WON'T LIVE
Line_2401	A CANDLE
Line_2402	UH THE CANDLE HAS ENERGY FROM THE FIRE R  SO
Line_2403	ITS IT WAS H
Line_2404	ENERGY ENE
Line_2405	THE ENERGY IS LIKE THE SOURCE
Line_2406	YES I HEARE IT LIGHT SO
Line_2407	IT STARTED TO FLAME UP
Line_2408	I COULD SEE UH
Line_2409	YOU KGAT ENERGY BY HITTING THE DRU
Line_2410	YES YOU CAND BECAUSE A IT S
Line_2411	I SEE ENERGY THE APPLES THE CANDLE THE WOOD AND THE GASOLENE
Line_2412	THE AR S GETTING THIRTYER YEAH
Line_2413	IT IT YEAH
Line_2414	UH THE SOTOF POWRS ARE GETTING ENERGY AND OFTER THE DRY AS IS GOING TO THE MODA AND  THE MORDOR IS MASN
Line_2415	UM THE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ENERGY AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ENERGY LIKE CARD YEAH OFF
Line_2416	REANEWE OUH
Line_2417	CARS AND TRAINS USED GUESS AND COAL TO WORK
Line_2418	OH IT WOULD BURN ON TE NEA WE'RE GET A FUMKI INTO
Line_2419	COAR THE SHREDS
Line_2420	IT RS BECAUSE WITH SETL ENERGY WE WERE ALL DYIN
Line_2421	IT IS THINGS THAT GO TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING WORKE WITH ENERGY
Line_2422	ENERGY HAS TO GOLE TO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE D CELL BUB
Line_2423	UM THE D CELL HAS ENERGY THAT GOS SA THE FARTHER DIVE SIDES O OUN
Line_2424	IT'S GOING IN FROM THE POSITIVE SLIGHTE AND COMING OUT TA NEGATIVE SIGHTE AND GOING IN THE T LIGHT BULBS
Line_2425	THOSE ARE THE ENERGY SO
Line_2426	THE BLUG BING DUTS ARE ENERGY THAT GOES IN TO LIGHT BULB ANDAND THO THE WIRES UND
Line_2427	THE FROM THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN
Line_2428	IT ALES UH BECAUSE
Line_2429	THERE IS  FROM THE WIRES IT DEPENDS ON THE WAER
Line_2430	I THINK THE IGH BUMBS WON'T BE THAT MUCH BRIGHT
Line_2431	THE LIGHT BULBS SWOW UNSHINE THAT MUCH ANYMORE
Line_2432	THE LIGHT BUMBS WOULD HAVE TO MUCH LIGHT AND THEN SO THERE BE SO BRIGHT AN I
Line_2433	OH WHAT'S TWO D CELLS ABOUT THE LIGHT BUMBS GET DRIGTER AND WITH ONE THE LIGHT BUMBS ARE THAT BRIGHT
Line_2434	THERE NEEDS TO BE A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE TO ARRLOFLON L
Line_2435	MLITER
Line_2436	UH WE ARE DOING A PE BAIL ON SOLAR PANELS AND HOW LE WORK
Line_2437	THERET IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2438	IT SHARES IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_2439	THERE ARE APE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_2440	THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEY SHAR ENERGY AND THIS SERIES CIRCUIT DO NOTHING ERE NOT
Line_2441	PARONEL ANCII
Line_2442	THAT THEY CIRCUITS YEAH YEAH NO METRCT
Line_2443	THE THE LIGHT BUMPS SCOR BURON OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOT OF ENERGY
Line_2444	UMTHEY ARE
Line_2445	IT IS A PARONLELL UMSA
Line_2446	THE PUTAL IS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE BUT NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_2447	YES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS WEARNING OUT BECAUSE IT HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND AND  THE ONE'S OF HAV THEM I DOUT THAT ONE'S
Line_2448	LEIT'S WAT'S ONE
Line_2449	THE PARE
Line_2450	CUD
Line_2451	WE AM LEARNING IN SIENCE TAPEAH WE ARE DOING UP PAPEA ON SCIENCE
Line_2452	BECAUSE THITRE IS A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_2453	IT WOULD EX BECAUSE WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2454	STREINGS ORE LIGHT ARE
Line_2455	SO A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT WOULD WORK
Line_2456	THE LIGHT THE OTHER LIGHTBU WON'T WORK
Line_2457	ONE OF
Line_2458	THE ENERGY DOESN'T UM GO IT DOESN'T FILW THROUGH THE LIGHT BUMB ANYMORE
Line_2459	IT WEL
Line_2460	IT IS NOT AND IT IS A ST CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_2461	I NOTICE THAT THEN UP THOA T G FORMS ARE BRAKING BECAUSE OF SHEARING ENERGY
Line_2462	H IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOTRAL
Line_2463	THAT UMTHE FIRST ONE IT'S IT SHOWES HOW IT BBRAKES AND THE SCECANT ONE SHOWES HOW ITSS
Line_2464	IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE IF ONE OF THEM IS BROKEN THEN THE OTHER LIGHT WOLL WON'T WORK BECAUSE THE ENERGY AND SUM HUROU
Line_2465	BECAUSE THE LIGHT M UM IS THE ONE THAT G
Line_2466	E NEX CIIND BARONEY
Line_2467	THEY ARE MAGNET
Line_2468	RELYGIL SIKES CHEATES ARE FRIGURE LITOR
Line_2469	IT COULD
Line_2470	ARE THE MAGNETS ASTICK TO THA REFRIGORATO
Line_2471	MAGNETS COULD STICK ON TO ANYTHING THAT'S IS
Line_2472	MAKE IT ACCORECT TO ANOTHERN MAGNETS ORLELS USTEEL
Line_2473	WIHI
Line_2474	THE BANNIT  STICK TO IS TRACTING TO THE NDNETL
Line_2475	WIDER'S STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE A MAGNET ATTROACTS ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL HOW RE I GON HEANT BY
Line_2476	THE MAGNET ORNITRIC SHOODON KNOW BECAUSE IT IS LIKE STEEL AND THE WHAT IS
Line_2477	WOKAN WRS THROUGH SOME STICXT ROU MAGNETS IRON AND STEEL BUT NOT COLPER NO OTHER MAGNET
Line_2478	ALL STIC O MAGNETICO'S THER MAGNET AND THEN THE NAIL IS IA OR STEEL AND THEN THE WHAT IS IT
Line_2479	THE BULS HAVE IRON I'LE DE
Line_2480	MAGNETS STICK TO IRON
Line_2481	IT STICK TO IRON NAILS AND MORE BUT NOT WOOD
Line_2482	SO NILLS CAN BE CAVERSAL YOU CAN LIF UP THE YOU CAN LIFT IT UP WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2483	WIRTE DIFFERENT ABOUT DNAILS ARE ONE OF THEM IS STEEL OR ELT IRON AND ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2484	EACH NAIL ONE OF THE NAIL IS NOT STICKING UP BUT ONE IS
Line_2485	ONE OF THE NA MIGHT BE STEEL OR I AWN THAT ONE MIGHT BE COPPER
Line_2486	POSEIT YEAH
Line_2487	OH NO
Line_2488	I THEENK JUST STEELOR SHED IS TIKING RUM THROUGH THEM
Line_2489	IT THREE OF THEM DON'T STICK BEFOR DO STICK
Line_2490	IT WON'T STICK UR
Line_2491	YEAS
Line_2492	I THINK ITS IS STEEL
Line_2493	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_2494	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE A TIP OF IRON THAT STICK UP TO MAGNETS
Line_2495	IT MYT HAVE IRON
Line_2496	UH WON'T GO BOE OF IRON IDON'T AND HELP THE AL LIS
Line_2497	THE MAGNET IS STICKING ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS NO SOING SAT N
Line_2498	THE POLE IT'S GOING AWAY THE MAGNET IS GOING WAIH BECUSE
Line_2499	ITHE'R FACING SOSNUM AR NOTSOUTH
Line_2500	IT TAKE HUMPIS THAT TELLS YOU WHAT'S NORTH AND SOUTH WARE A MAGNET
Line_2501	A FUNCTIONS BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTING THAT OTHER MAGNETS
Line_2502	WE HAVE BEEN ARKING ON MAGNET FIELDS
Line_2503	MAGNETS HIS SL I CIVES OF MAGNET
Line_2504	THEY ARE STILL STICKING TOGETHER
Line_2505	THE PAPER IS RAD BETWEEN THE MAGNET IS SIGOING AND THE PAPER CLIP IS TWO
Line_2506	IT HAS TO WITH FLORLS
Line_2507	IT'S THE WALLSAY OOM
Line_2508	THE MAGNET IS ON THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING ON THE TE PAPER CLIP
Line_2509	THE NAIL ISN'T GIVING IT SON'T GETTING FARSE FROM THE MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_2510	IT IS SHOWING YOU THE FEELD AROUND THEN
Line_2511	THAT MAGNET HAD SO FIELD AROUND IT
Line_2512	THE MAGNET HAS A FIELDR AROUND IT AND THEN IT'S GOING TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_2513	MAGNETIC FIEEL
Line_2514	IT WON'T WAR BECAUSE YOU NEED NINTY UNTILL THE MUNDLE WLL SIP T
Line_2515	MYRITS WILL SEPARATE AND HTHEAH GOE TO NINETEEN
Line_2516	THE MAGNETS ARE WITH THE FORK ARE GETTING THE SPACERS
Line_2517	HE MAGNETS WOULD BE SEPARATE WOULD BE SEPARATE WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2518	IT'S A BATTERY A SWITCH SOME WIRES A WIRE AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_2519	OAIT'S I'S
Line_2520	YOULD NATURE USE A CLOTED CIRCUIT FOR IT TO WORK
Line_2521	WHEN IT IS A OPEN CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T WORK IT WILL ITA CLOSE CIRCUIT IT STARS GOOD
Line_2522	IF IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND THAT MEANS IT  FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IT WILL GO OUT TO NOWER
Line_2523	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY DOESN'T MORE BECAUSE IT'S GOING OFF TO MILTAR AND THERE IS NO MAGNETS STICKING ON TO IT TO THE NEL
Line_2524	IT WOL' WORK
Line_2525	THERE ARE D CELL BUTTERRY WASHE A SWITCH AND WATER AND A STEEL RIU IT
Line_2526	WIT A TRSTICK AND THE CRISCTHE CRISCTITDAL VAGADED
Line_2527	E ELECTRICITY GOLBS TO THA BANDET
Line_2528	THAT'S THE ELECTRICITY
Line_2529	BECAUSE THE RIMETS ISN'T ELECISN'T A MAGNET AND SO THE ELECTRICITY IS
Line_2530	YOU SEE THE LIGHT
Line_2531	IT'S APPORRENT TO SEY THINGS BEAK
Line_2532	IT SOMETIMES IF IT HITS A METER IT REFLECTS HOW A IT HITS YOUR EYE WHEN YOU COULD SEE THE LIGH
Line_2533	THAT RIGHT REFLECTS TO ANYTHING
Line_2534	THAT IT REFLKS OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING
Line_2535	IF IT HITS ONE OF THE OPRAS IN AE ROM IT REFLECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_2536	IN THE ROUB THE LIGHT REFLEXES TO  ALMOST ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WALL
Line_2537	WHAT IS HAPPONING IS THAT THE LIGHT IN REFLECTIONG THROUGH THE MIROR HAS BEEN OING INTO THE PERSONS Y
Line_2538	WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT A PENSL IS IN THE WATER
Line_2539	WHEN IT IS LOWERED INTO THE WATER UM THE PENCIL MOES
Line_2540	THAT THE LIGHT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT COULD MAKE THE PACE UM LIGHTER
Line_2541	HE THE LIGHTS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISUM IS GOING FIRST IT'S WHIGHT
Line_2542	THE LIGHT GOES THOH THE PRISUM AND THEN IT'S RAMBULE CO
Line_2543	IT TURNED INTO A RAMBLE LIGHT COLOR
Line_2544	I SEE SEVAN CUNNERS
Line_2545	THEY ARE WHIGHTE AND THEN THEY SPREAD ON TO OTHERS
Line_2546	SEVEN
Line_2547	WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON IT REFLICTS TO THE BLUE BULLB
Line_2548	WHEN IT'S BOUNCING ANOUGH OF THE BULLB THE BULB IS BLOU SO THE LIGHT IS TURNING BLUE WHEN IT HITS THE BLUE BULLB
Line_2549	THIT IS A REFLECT THING THROUGH THE BALLM
Line_2550	INTO SHERNING YETLE ONES ABOUT THROG OP THE WEA
Line_2551	THEY TURN RED OR A STORKS
Line_2552	YES BECAUSE IT WOULD TURN TO THE COTOR THAT OVEN IS AOUGH DARKER
Line_2553	WHAT HAPEN IS THAT THE LIGHT IS GOING THROUGH THE FLOTER THAT IS MAKING IT M BLUE WRALS
Line_2554	IT WILL JUST CHEIN DIREC
Line_2555	IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR SO THAT
Line_2556	BECAUSE IT IS
Line_2557	WHEN WHEN YOU THAD A SAFE ON THE GREEN OR BLUE  BWHEN YOU CLICK ON THE RED ONE IT
Line_2558	THE WATER PLUSE THE SALT EQUALS SALT WATER THAT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2559	A SOLUTE
Line_2560	THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED AND ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE CAN MAKE SALT WATER
Line_2561	A SOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIXTURES BECAUSE U ONE ITOM HAS DSOLVED INTO THE OTHER ITOM
Line_2562	THE SOLE
Line_2563	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT ITCOES SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED BUT IT BECOMES PART OF THE WATER SO IT STILL ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2565	IT I IT'S ALL ADDED UP TO AND A A NE WEIGHT
Line_2566	THE MASS IS GETTING GREAITER
Line_2567	THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND IF YOU ADD THEM IT EQUAES SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_2568	THE WATER HAS ANED FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT AND THEREFORE IT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_2569	YOU CAN USE A COFFY FILTER OR YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT
Line_2570	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2571	IT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE GRAVEL THE SAND CAN NOT MIX WITH THE THE WATER BECAUSE IT CAN DISSOLV
Line_2572	IT HAS TURNED INTO A MIXTURE
Line_2573	IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ASID HAS BLENDED INTO THE WATER
Line_2574	YOU HAVE TO DISSOLVE THE WATER
Line_2575	YOU HAVE TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT AND THEN THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUTE
Line_2576	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_2577	IT THE WATER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2578	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE
Line_2579	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE SOLUTE FROM THE
Line_2580	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTE TO WIS SEPARATE
Line_2581	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES
Line_2582	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE USING EVAPORATION BECAUSE YOU CANT SEPARATE IT WITH A FILTER
Line_2583	THEY ARE USING A MAGNET TO TAK OUT THE PINS
Line_2584	THEY ARE SEPARATING GRAVEL A ROCKS WITH A FILTER
Line_2585	GRAVEL AND WATER
Line_2586	SO YOU CAN SEPARATE THE GRAVEL FROM THE WATER
Line_2587	THE GRAVEL IS BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER USING A SCREEN
Line_2588	THE MAGNET IS STUCKING UP THE LITTLE PENS WITH MAGNETTIGHE
Line_2589	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN CAN FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_2590	I NOTICED THAT THE WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS WERE IN THE MAGNET PICKED THEM RIGHT UP BECAUSE THEIR MAGNETIC
Line_2591	I NOTICE THAT THE GRAVEL GOT SEPARATED BY THE SCREEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FLIT THROUGH
Line_2592	BECAUSE THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH IT AND THE GRAVEL CAN
Line_2593	THIS IS THE BEST FOR USING EVAPORATION TO SEPARATE THE SALT FROM THE WA
Line_2594	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2595	TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU NEAD A POWDER THAT CAN DISSOLVE INTO WATER
Line_2596	THE GRE POWDER IS GETTING PUT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2597	YOU CAN WEIGH IT WITH TA SCAIL OR YOU CAN SEE IT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2598	ONE SOLUTION HAS MORE GREAT POWDER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2599	I SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE SCOOPS IN THE FIRST ONE AND THEN ONE SCOOP AND THE SECOND ORNER
Line_2600	YOU CAN WEIGH BOTH SOLUTIONS USING GRAMS AND THE ONE THAT WEIGHS MORE IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2601	A SCAIL
Line_2602	THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR
Line_2603	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS USUALLY HAVE MORE POWDER
Line_2604	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THE THAN THE ONES WITH LIGHTER
Line_2605	THE LIGHTER COLORS SOLUTIONS ARE DILUTED
Line_2606	IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
Line_2607	I THINK IT WOULD TAST STRONGER BECAUSE THE MORE POWDER YOU HAVE THE STRONG PANAL BE
Line_2608	IT WOULD TAST LIGHTER AND MORE DILUTED
Line_2609	IT WOULD NOT BE AS STRONG AS THE ONE WITH THE MORE GREH POWDER
Line_2610	ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER TO THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2611	ADD FIFTY MILLIERS OF WATER
Line_2612	YOU CAN ADD MORE POWDER OR ADD MORE WATER
Line_2613	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2614	WE HAVE MADE SALT AND WATER SOLUTIONS AND COLAIDE SOLUTIONS
Line_2615	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM BECAUSE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT TO THE WATER
Line_2616	THE ROCK IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FETHER BECAUSE THE FETHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NIGH GRAMS
Line_2617	IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2618	ONE CUP HAS T TEN PER TEN GRAMS MORE SOLUTE
Line_2619	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE SO A THE SOLUTES ADS WEIGHT
Line_2620	I WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE SOLUTE HADS WEAIGHT
Line_2621	ONE HAS TEN MORE GRAMS OF SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_2622	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE OF THE SOUTE THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS AND IT WEIGHS LESS
Line_2623	YOU CAN WEIGH THEM
Line_2624	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2625	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2626	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2627	SOLUTION BA
Line_2628	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2629	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2630	IT'S DISSOLVING THE SALT AND IT'S GETTING SATURATED
Line_2631	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED
Line_2632	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2633	THAT MEANS THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE SALT INTO IT
Line_2634	THE WATER IS GETTING CONCENTRATED WITH SHOOGER
Line_2635	IT CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2636	THIS SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS MORE THAN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER BECAUSE THE SALT ADS WEIGHT
Line_2637	THE THE SALT ADDS WEIGHT
Line_2638	WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLIT
Line_2639	THAT MEANS IT'S NOT SOLIUABLE
Line_2640	THE POWDER IS SOLUT
Line_2641	YOU NEED A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT
Line_2642	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_2643	THE WATER IS GETTING SATURATED
Line_2644	THAT MEANS THE UM WATER IS SATURATED
Line_2645	THE EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2646	THAT MEANS THE WATER IS SATURAT
Line_2647	THES THE WATER CAN NOT DISSOLVE ANYMORE SALT SALT
Line_2648	IT LEAVES SOME OF THE SALT ON THE BOTTO
Line_2649	ONE OF THE SIDE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN
Line_2650	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2651	EACH SOLUTE EACH ONE OF THE THINGS IS SOL
Line_2652	THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
Line_2653	SATURATING SOLUTIONS
Line_2654	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTIONS TOGETHER TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2655	IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2656	WE MIXE CALCIUM CLORRIDE BAKING SODA AND THEN CALCIUM CLORID AND CITRIC ACSID AND THEN FINALLY BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID
Line_2657	I THINK SO BECAUSE BAKING SODA WHEN IT HIT WHEN IT HITS WATER IT FIZES
Line_2658	WATER THE SOLVENT
Line_2659	THEY MIX TOGETHER AND SEPARATE
Line_2660	THEY ARE MIXED TO CREATE A NEW MOLECUEL
Line_2661	THEY WILL MIX TOGETHER AND CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2662	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLORRID
Line_2663	THE SOLUTION HAS LEFT A E PRICIPITATE
Line_2664	IT HAS MADE A NEW MOLECLUL
Line_2665	THERE HAVE BEEN PARPLE MOLECULES CREATED IN THE WATE
Line_2666	IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF THE WATER
Line_2667	I SAW
Line_2668	IT GOT COLD
Line_2669	THE TWO MIXTURES THE TWO SOLUTIONS HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT IS PINKED
Line_2670	YES BECAUSE THE PRODUCT TURN PINT
Line_2671	IT HAS MADE IT
Line_2672	HE MADE A POP IN THE BOEM
Line_2673	TION IT'S HA AND IT'S GETTING AR
Line_2674	THERE IS A CREMICALTHE B CAN
Line_2675	WHENT INTOH
Line_2676	URE TO STICK A
Line_2677	YES BECAUSE IT IS GLOWING
Line_2678	IT HAS MADE A CEMOCAL REATA
Line_2679	YES BECAUSE THE GRA THE WATER HAS TURN PURPLE
Line_2680	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION OR CURRING
Line_2681	TWO REACTONS COMBINING
Line_2682	IF THERE IS A PRODUCT
Line_2683	THE PRODUCT IS THE REMAINING THING AT THE BOTTOM
Line_2684	BAKING SODA AND I CEMICAL CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2685	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2686	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIEL AND SOIL ROCKS AND LAM FORMS
Line_2687	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_2688	WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2689	I SEE LOTS OF CLAY FELT GRAVEL AND HUMAS
Line_2690	HUMINES GRAVEL CLAY AND SLT
Line_2691	HUMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SLT
Line_2692	THERE ARE THESE SOILES R FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2693	THEY ARE ALL FORM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2694	THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PLACEIS
Line_2695	SAND CLAY GRAVELE PEBLES AND ORGANIC MATTER
Line_2696	ALL SOILS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE FEROM DIFFERENT CLIMETS
Line_2697	THEY BOTH THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WIT REEALS
Line_2698	THEY ARE SPREDDED OUT THROUGH THE GRAVEL
Line_2699	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY MOST OF THEM HAVE SAND
Line_2700	THE DELTA HAS MORE HUMINESS AND MORE SAND AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A TINEY BIT OF GRAVEL
Line_2701	IN THE DELTA THERE IS MORE SAND IN THE DESERT THERE IS MORE GRAVEL THAN SAND
Line_2702	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS SOILES AND THEN FORM
Line_2703	WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STREEM TABLES
Line_2704	THE STREEM TABLE WITH THE SLOP HAS A BIGGER FAN THE ONE WITH OUT A SLOP HAS THE SMALLER FAN
Line_2705	A RIVER THAT IS STEEP FLOWES DOWN A RIVER THAT IS FLAT GOES SLOW
Line_2706	AND THE ONE WITH THE DEP SNOW THERE THE WATER IS GOING FAST FOR THE ITH THE FLAT IS GOING SLOW
Line_2707	THE WATER ON THE FLAT SLOWP IS GOING SLOW AND THE WATER ON THE SLEAP STEEP SLOWP IS GOING FAST
Line_2708	THE FLOW OF THE WATER GETS FASTER
Line_2709	ONE I GUM I MAKE BUBBLES
Line_2710	THE FLED CONDITIONS HAVE MAKE MORE CANIEONS THAN THE STANDARD CONDITION
Line_2711	DURING A FLUD THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN IT'S SUPOSED TO
Line_2712	ONES FASTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_2713	IT S PICKS UP AND STDY'S GOING FASTER
Line_2714	IN TWENTY FORTH CEAND THE FLUD HAS TAKEN DOWN TREES AND ROCKS FROM THE LAND
Line_2715	AN ERTH QUAIKE
Line_2716	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ROCKS CRACKING BECAUSE OF WETHER
Line_2717	CEMICAL WETHERING
Line_2718	THE ROCK HAS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS THAT IS CALLED PHYSICAL WETHERING
Line_2719	THE ROCKS SMASHED INTO OTHER ROCKS
Line_2720	I NOTICED THAT THE ROCK CA WENT DOWN THROUGH WATER AND WAS STILL MOVING
Line_2721	THE ROUTS ARE BREAKNG ARE GOING INTO THE ROCK AND ARE EXPANDING TO CRACP THE ROCK
Line_2722	WHEN WATER FILLS UP A CRACK IN THE WROCK AND IT FREESES THEN THE THE ICE IX THE WATER EXPANDS AND CRACKS THE WROCK
Line_2723	WHEN WATER GETS INTO A CRACK OF A ROCK IT FREESES AND EXPANDS TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2724	THE WATER GOT INTO THE ROCK AND I FROSE AND EXPANDED TO CRACK THE ROCK
Line_2725	IT EXPANDS AND
Line_2726	THE FRESING JAR HAS CRACKD THE ICE BECAUSE THE WATER HAS EXPANDED
Line_2727	THE WATER HAS EXPANDED AND BROKE THE GLASS
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE WATER EXPANDS
Line_2729	THE PILE OF ROCKS AT THE ON THE LEFT ARE PEBLES AND THE AND THE ROCK  ON THE RIGHT AR GRAVEL
Line_2730	THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE

Line_2751	TLIAY
Line_2752	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MENETERS AND HOW LIGHT CAN REFLECT OFF TH
Line_2753	BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR THE THE ELECTRO MAGNETISM TO BE INDUCED
Line_2754	THE WIRES WRAPPED AWROUNT THE RIVET WHICH INDUCSES ELECTRO MAGNETWHICH MAKES FAIL
Line_2755	IT PRENDUCES MAGNETISM WHICH MAKES THE RIVED AN ELECTRO MAGNET WHICH IS A WHICH ALLOWS IT TO PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_2756	ITIT INDUCES MAGS TISM BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HASN'T A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_2757	THERE'S NO FLOW FOR ELECTRICITY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING THE WHOLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER
Line_2758	ALL WELL THE SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ETHER OPENS STOPS THE CIRCUIT OR COMPLEETES IT
Line_2759	WELL WITHOUT ELECTRICITY NALECTROMAGNET COULD NEVER BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ELECTIT INDUCES THE MAGNET
Line_2760	THE WIRES HAVE THER HAS TO BE ENOUGH COILES WITH THE WIRE FOR IT COA INDUCE MAGNETISM
Line_2761	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPING AWROUNTD THE VIVID WHICH UST INDUCING MAGNETISM AND THE WIND WHICH IS ALLOWINGD IT TO PICK UP THE WASHERS

Line_2850	THEY'RE REFLECTING OFF OF THEM
Line_2851	THEY HAVE TO BE SOLID FOR LIGHT TO REFLECT OFF OF THEM
Line_2852	I NOTICE THAT THEY REFLECT OFF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_2853	LIGHT REFLECTS OFF DIFFERENT WAYS WHEN IT HITS A SOLID OBJECT
Line_2854	THE LIGHT IS SHINING ON TO THE BOY AND THEN ON TO THE MER SO THAT HE CAN SEE HIMSELF IN THE MER
Line_2855	BECAUSE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF IT AND SHOOTING OVER TO HIM
Line_2856	IT'S BEING USED TO REFLECT  LIKE A SPOT LIGHT ON A BILDING
Line_2857	THE LIGHT REFLECTS BACK OVER TO THE FIRST NEROR
Line_2858	THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING OFF OF THE MARS AND IT'S HITTING THEM SO THAT THEY REFLECT ON TO THE ONE OTHER MAR

Line_2872	THERERE ONE IS WHIGHT LIGHT AND ONE IS YELLOW
Line_2873	ONE BULB IS BLUWE AND ONE BULB IS YELLOW
Line_2874	UM IT HAS LIGHT AND YOU'RE BRAKING UP THE LIGHT INTO WRA
Line_2875	THEY TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2876	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE THINGS UH WOULD CHANGE
Line_2877	IT TURNS THE LIGHT BLUWE
Line_2878	YELLOW AND BLUE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS SO WHEN THEY MIXED TOGETHERTHER THEY KIND OF MAKE OTHER COLOR
Line_2879	SOME THINGS TURN THE SAME COLOR BUT SOME THINGS TURN DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_2880	THE GREEN WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER GREEN BUT THE RED AND THE BLUE WILL MAKE IT LOOK THE SAME
Line_2881	WELL THE LIGHT CHRANGE DIFFERENT COLORED THINGS DIFFERENT
Line_2882	BECAUSE IT'S GREEN IT 'LL LOOK GREENER
Line_2883	THEY TURN BROWNISH AND THE GREEN AND BLUE LIGHT AND TURNS MORE REDISH AND THE RED LIGHT
Line_2884	RED AND GREEN ARE AND BLU AND GREEN ARE ANY DIFFERENT BUT RIGTE IS REATERK

Line_2910	WHEN THE WLIGHT LIGHT HITS THE BLUE BULB IT TURNS INTO BLUE LIGHT
Line_2911	THE ONAD IN THE BULB IS STILL WHIGHT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE BLUE
Line_2912	SAME THING JUST TE IT'S JUST YEALOW THIS TIME
Line_2913	AS REFLECTING
Line_2914	THE ONE THAT HITS IT IS HITTING A WHEIGHT SPOT THE ONES THAT REFLECT ARE HITTING THE YELOW SPOT
Line_2915	WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE PAPER IT CHANGES THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT
Line_2916	SHADES OF  LIGHT
Line_2917	THEY CHANGED COLOR
Line_2918	YET SIRETIIT R
Line_2919	I DON'T KNOW IT TURNS BLACK
Line_2920	OF COURSE YEAH
Line_2921	OUCABOLARIES PUT THE BATTERY ON TOP  A LIGHT BULB
Line_2922	A BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_2923	THE PATHWAY MERY GOES TO THE WARE
Line_2924	LIGHT BULBS  MAKE THE LIGHT TURN ON THE WIRES AND THE ELECT THE WIRES CARRIYE THE ELECTRICITY TE POWER ON LIGHT BUL
Line_2925	WHEN THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON IT'S BECAUSE THE ENERGY CIRCUIT POWERES TO IT D CELL TO THE LIGH
Line_2926	I SEE ELECTRICITY HEATING THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH A CIR
Line_2927	IT'S ROLLING TOTHE MINESS SINE IT IT'S GOING THROUGH THE FLUS LIGHT AND IT KEEPS WROH CHANGING AGAIN
Line_2928	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A CIRCUIT THAT CONNECTS
Line_2929	ELECTRICITY FUL WAS TOWARD THE POSITIVE
Line_2930	ELECTRICITY OE AND HE IT'S BLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_2931	THE POSITIVE SIEN THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLILLEDS TO THE POSITIVE SIEN
Line_2932	THAT N ELECTRICITY FLLS TO THE OPOSIT
Line_2933	THET FLOWIS GO TO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_2934	BN YOU FLIP IT IT CHANGES DIRECTIONS
Line_2935	I THINK IT OD HM I THINK IT  POM
Line_2936	M HE UH GOOD
Line_2937	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2938	THE PILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT A THE SAME AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS P ALL OF THAT DIFFERENT KINDS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2939	SOLUTIONS
Line_2940	ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS  THE CHILD MAKES SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER A MIXTURE
Line_2941	THE WATER IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP AND THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP
Line_2942	THE SALT WOU WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	I THINK WE COUOD BECAUSE EVERY THING CAN BE LIKE SEPARATED FROM A SOLUTION OR A MIXTURE
Line_2944	WE HAVE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2945	THAT WATER PLUS DIFFERENT MATERIALS MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2946	I THINK THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2947	WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ARE MIXED WITH WATER AND MAKING SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE SALT DISSOLVED IN THE WATER AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A MIXTURE
Line_2949	THE WATER IS THE THING THAT THE IS U THE THING IS BEING DISSOLVED IN
Line_2950	HERE THE SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BUT THE WATER CAN NOT BE DISSOLVED IN THE SALT
Line_2951	THI SALT IS A SOLVENT AND WHEN IT'S POURED INTO THE WATER IT CREATES A MIXTURE
Line_2952	THE SALT
Line_2953	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER THEY CREATE A BIGGER MASS OR WEIGHT
Line_2954	THAT WHEN YOU MIX TWO THINGS TOGETHER IT WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT WEIGHT
Line_2955	THE MASS IS INCREASING
Line_2956	ONE KIND OF GRAM PLUSS ONE KIND OF GRAM EQUALS THID GRAM TOGETHER
Line_2957	SOLUTION
Line_2958	THAT MEANS IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2959	YOU CAN LET IT EVAPORATE YOU CAN PICK IT OUT BY HAND
Line_2960	YOU CAULD LET IT EVAPORATDES
Line_2961	THINKS MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TO I CAN WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
Line_2962	UH WE HAVE BEEN STUDYIING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND LEARNING HOW TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2963	SOLUTIONS ARE TWO OR MORE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2964	ONE HAS MORE POWDER AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2965	THE DARKER COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE MORE GRAPE STUFF IN IT AND THE ONES WITH LESS COLOR HAVE LESS GRAPE STUFF IN IT
Line_2966	I CAN TELL BY LOKING AT THE DARKER COLORED CUPS THAT THEY HAVE MORE STUFF IN IT PURPLE STUF
Line_2967	IT IS MORE DILUTID
Line_2968	IT WOULD TAST LESS FLAVER FOU FALL AND GRAPY
Line_2969	I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTION BY EITHER ADDING OR TAKING AWAY MORE OF THE STUFF THAT'S INSIDE IT
Line_2970	WE CAN ADD MORE WATER
Line_2971	BY MARYE IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TWO LATER
Line_2972	I'M GOOD BUT MY BEST FRINAL IF TURN CS ON CRETY
Line_2973	WE'VE BEEN WORKING BY MIXTURES AND SOLUTION AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEASPETIALLY UPON THR YOU CANT STE
Line_2974	ONE OF THEM HAS GREAT MIX IN THEM AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WATER SOLUTION IN THEM A SALT WATER FOLUN AN
Line_2975	YOU CAN TELL A SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED WHEN IT HAS A DIFFERENT
Line_2976	THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK WEIGHS NIGNTY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCELL TOGETHER THE FETHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_2977	ONE HAS MORE SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS
Line_2978	I THINK THE ONE WITH CAMEY GRAMS OF SOLUTES WILL WEIGH MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SOLUTE THE OTHER ONE HAS LES
Line_2979	I FOUND OUT THAT NOT THAT MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOUTE WEIGHE A BIT MORE THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS
Line_2980	BY DOING THE GRAMN ADDING
Line_2981	I AM SOALLCALLS I DON'T KNOW
Line_2982	ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED TWO IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THREE IS IN THE MIDDL
Line_2983	I THINK NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS A LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2984	BYE MARNEY IT WAS REALLY GOOD TALKING TO YOU TO BYE-BYE
Line_2985	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES AND THAT SALT AND WATER MIXD THE SALT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2986	IT RELATES BY MIX SAYING WATER WITH SOLIDS
Line_2987	WE CALL IT A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIXES TOGETHER
Line_2988	WE WOULD CALL THESE SOLUTIONS
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF CHIRAL MIX SEPARATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FILTERNS OUT THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
Line_2990	THE DIFFERENT INGRIDIENTS ARE GETTING SEPARATED OUT OF THE MAIN PILE
Line_2991	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE JIENT MASS OF SOLID
Line_2992	THE SCREEN IS FILTURING THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_2993	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY SEPARATED
Line_2994	THE SALT AND WATER
Line_2995	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2996	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND WITH THIS MITURE IT BECOMES A SOLUTION NOT JUST A MIXTURE
Line_2997	I 'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_2998	WE ARE LEARNING THAT ALL MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_2999	THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3000	A SOLVENT
Line_3001	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER AND THE SAND IS BECOMING A MIXTURE WITH THE WATER
Line_3002	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECAME A SOLUTION
Line_3003	ALL OF THEM MATERIALS WEIGHT   DIDN'T ADD OR SOUBTRACT THEY ALL JUST GOT ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3004	IT SHOWS US THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS KEEP THEIR SAME MASS WHEN MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3005	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3006	A SOLUTION
Line_3007	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3008	IT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE
Line_3009	YOU CAN FILTER IT OUT IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_3010	THE SALT WATER DID NOT FILTER OUT
Line_3011	A SOLUTION
Line_3012	YOU LET THE WATER DISSOLVE
Line_3013	IT'S E VAPORRATING
Line_3014	IT'S LETTING THE WATER EVAPORATE SO THE MATERIAL IS STILL THERE
Line_3015	YOU COULD LET THE WATER EVAPORAT
Line_3016	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
Line_3017	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3018	BECAUSE IT SEPARATES THE TWO AND GRARIEA
Line_3019	MAGNETS AND SCREENS
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE SEEVE SEPARATES THE LARGE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL CAN UM FIT THROUGH THE SMALLER WHOLES
Line_3021	ASE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THE MAGNET DRAWS ALL THE PAPER CLIPS OUT
Line_3022	BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3023	I NOTICED THAT THE GRAVEL WOULD STAY ON TOP OF THE SCREEN AND ALL THE OTHER ENGREDIENTS WOULD FLL THROUGH THE SSCREEN
Line_3024	EVERY MATERIAL OTHER THAN THE SALT STAYES IN THE FILTER BUT THE SALT FLOWS THROUGH
Line_3025	TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENTS OUT OTHER THAN THE SALT
Line_3026	SALT WATER YOU EVAPORATE THE WATER SO THE SALT CRYSTLS CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND THEY TAKE UP A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3027	THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3028	HIE MARNDY YOU LOOK VERY PRITY TO DAY NOT
Line_3029	MIXTURES INSOLUTIONS
Line_3030	YOU DISSOLVE A SOLUTE INTO A SOLVENT
Line_3031	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3032	LIKE IN THE GREAT PTASTIC EXAMPLE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MORE PURPLE THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3033	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3034	TACSED COLORAND
Line_3035	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS CONCENTRATION AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE CONCENTRATION
Line_3036	THAT THEY SE MORE CONCENTRATE
Line_3037	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS CONCENTRAT
Line_3038	LESS FLAVER SALT
Line_3039	ONE TAS MORE WATERY AND ONE TAIS MORE FULL OF FLAVER
Line_3040	ADDING DIFFERENT INGREEDIENT
Line_3041	ADDING OR TAKING AWAY WATERS
Line_3042	BY MARNEY I'LL MISS YOU
Line_3043	GOOD HOW ARE YOU BARNEY
Line_3044	THE DRINKS ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE DRINKS ON THE RIGHT ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3045	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GREAP DRINK MIXD YOU CAN TELL E
Line_3046	CEYES I AM FAMILIAR WITH A BALAN
Line_3047	THE CONCENTRATION
Line_3048	ONE OF THE CUPS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER CU
Line_3049	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3050	THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE WITH TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE BECAUSE IT IS HEAVIER
Line_3051	MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE WAS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3052	THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE LESS CONCENTRATED AND AS IT GOES TO THE RIGHT THEY GET MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3053	THE MOST CONCENTRATED IS ONE AND THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS TWO
Line_3054	THE MOST IS ONE THIST IS TWO
Line_3055	B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SEE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3056	BY MARNEY I'LL MISS YOUS SO MUCH
Line_3057	WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE MIXSTURY INGREEDIENT AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS BY FULTERING AND SCREENING AND ALL THE SCIENTIFFIC STUFF
Line_3058	IT FLOW
Line_3059	IT THINKS
Line_3060	THAT SOLUTION AR SATURATED THAN SOLUTION B
Line_3061	ONE HAS MORE DENCITY AND ONE HAS LESS DENCITY
Line_3062	IT WOULD THINK
Line_3063	IF A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT'S LESS DENSE
Line_3064	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION GOES TO THE TOP BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE
Line_3065	THEY ARE CREATING A DIFFERENT SOLUTION WITH EQUAL CONCENTRATION
Line_3066	ONE RISES TO THE TOP AND ONE SHINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3067	ONES MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER SO ONE FLOWTS ON THE TOP THE OTHER
Line_3068	THEY PART SOLUTION A FIRST AND SOLUTION B SECOND
Line_3069	BECAUSE THE SOLUTION AIS MO
Line_3070	BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION PS ANOTHER SOLUTION EQUALS A BIGGER SOLUTION
Line_3071	THE ONE AT THE BOTOM IS THE LEAST DENSE
Line_3072	THERE IS SEPARAT I
Line_3073	BYE MARNEY ILL MISS YOU SO MUCH AND I'M EXCITED FOR OUR NEXT NEXT LESSON
Line_3074	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING CEMICAL REACTIONS
Line_3075	THE SOLUTION CRATED SALT WHEN IT DISSOLVED
Line_3076	THE CEMICALS IN THE MATERIALS CREATING THE SOLUTION MADE SALT
Line_3077	THE INGREEDIENTS MADE A NEW PRODUCT
Line_3078	THE MIXTURE CREATEING GASS
Line_3079	THEY CHANGED TO FORM GASS AND SALT
Line_3080	THERE IS DIFFERENT MOLECLULS
Line_3081	THE TWO MIXED TOGETHER AND MASS HAPPEND
Line_3082	THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
Line_3083	IT TELLS ME THAT EVERY THING ON ERTH CAN BE REMADE OR DESTROIED
Line_3084	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE LET THE GASS GO WHEN ONE KEPT THE GASS SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3085	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND ONE BAG IS CLOSE
Line_3086	WE WEAREN'T LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_3087	YOU ARE SEPARATING THEM INTO DIFFERENT PILES SO WHAT THEY
Line_3088	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A MIXTR
Line_3089	THEY ARE IN GROUPS AND OF WHAT THEY ARE
Line_3090	YOU ARE FILTERING IT OUT SO THAT IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANY
Line_3091	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED SO IT IS NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_3092	IT IS IN PORING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IT IS IT GOT SEPARATED AND IT IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_3093	THEY DON'T THEY'RE SEPARATED
Line_3094	IT IS FILLDRAWING OUT THE SAND
Line_3095	IS SALTUM
Line_3096	THE SALT GETS DISSOLVED TO MAKE THE WATER HIGHER
Line_3097	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND
Line_3098	YES YOU CAN GET IT OUT BY UH EVAPORATING THE WATER
Line_3099	IT CAN NOT GET SEPARATED
Line_3100	MIXTURES CAN BE SEPARATED AND SOLUTIONS CAN NOT
Line_3101	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3102	THEY CAN BE THI THE
Line_3103	REIGHT MIXTURES BY A SCREEN MAGNETISM AND DENCITY
Line_3104	THE ROCKS ARE GETTING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE OF THE SCREE
Line_3105	THE A MIXTURE
Line_3106	TO SEPARATE OUT THE ROCK
Line_3107	BECAUSE THAT THING IS MAGNETIC SO THOAN TO STICK TO THE MAGNTET
Line_3108	BECAUSE TEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY BE MAGNETIC AND THEY MIGHT NOT
Line_3109	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC THEY'RE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3110	BECAUSE PAPER BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC
Line_3111	IT SEPARATED OUT THE ROCKS BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN FITS IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK MORE EFFICIANT LE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3113	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3114	BECAUSE SAND CAN'T GO THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT WORK
Line_3115	IT WORKSE BECAUSE ALL THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT WAS BACK THEN
Line_3116	IT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT HAS TO BE SEPARATED NO OTHER WAY WITH WORK
Line_3117	THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE ALL TO GET EVERYTHING IN DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_3118	T'S TRYING TO CHOV PROVE THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TOGETHER IT CHANGES IT'S PROPERTY
Line_3119	YOU ARE MIXING SAND AND WATER TOGETHER TO MAKE A SAND AND WATER SOLUTION
Line_3120	THE SALT THE SALT WILL
Line_3121	THE SALT GOT MIXED IN AND THI AND DISSOLVED IN THE SANDDID
Line_3122	IT DISSOLVE TO SHOW THAT IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3123	IT IS THE THING THAT IS THAT IS NOT GETTING
Line_3124	BECAUSE THEY THEY STAND TOGETHER R AND IT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED
Line_3125	THE SALT IS A SOLUTE AND IT GETS DISSALT
Line_3126	IT IS THA SOLVENT AND THE SALT IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO IT
Line_3127	A SOLUTE
Line_3128	IT IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND HEAVIER THEN EACH SEPARATE
Line_3129	WHEN YOU ADD IT TOGETHER IT ADDS THE GRAMS OF THE SALT
Line_3130	IT IS ADDING MORE WEIGHT
Line_3131	IT MEAN THAT WHEN YOU ADD THEM TOGETHER IT HAS MORE WEIGHT
Line_3132	THE MAS IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVY
Line_3133	THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS SO WHEN YOU AD THEM TOGETHER IT SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_3134	IT'S FIFTY PLU FIFTY PLU FIFTY FIFTEEN AND IT SHOWES THAT THE SALT KEEPS IT'S UN PROR KEEPS IT'S ON WEIG
Line_3135	SOLUTION
Line_3136	WE CAN EITHER SEPARATET BY EVAPORATING IT LIKE SALT AND WATER OR USE SOMETHING TO FRE
Line_3137	YOU'RE SEPARATING OUT THE FLOWER BY PUTING IT IN THE FILTER AND YOU'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_3138	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3139	A MIXTURE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SAND WAS SEPARATED AND IF IT HAD STAIED IN THE WATER IT WOULD AVE BEEN A SOLUTION
Line_3140	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3141	THE CECITRIC ASID DISSOLVED AND INTO THE WATER AND IT COULDN'T BE SO SEPARATED WITH THIS FILTER
Line_3142	SOLUTION
Line_3143	IN THE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE SALT OUT
Line_3144	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND THEN YOU EVAPORATED IT SO THEN IT IT UM IT WAS BACK TO THE THE SALT AGAIN
Line_3145	IT IS EVAPORATING INTO THE AIR AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AGAIN
Line_3146	IT IS EVAPORATING
Line_3147	IT WORKS THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A SOLUTION BUT B YEAH
Line_3148	ONLY SALT TO SHOW THAT IT WORKED TO SEPARATE IT OUT
Line_3149	THEY ARE PERFECT SQUARES THA SO THE SALT DIDDN'T CONTAIN ITS SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3150	IT REQUIRES TIME YOU NEAED TIME TO EVAPORATE STUFF
Line_3151	THA YOU CAN SEPARATE A A SOLUTE FROM A SOLUTION AND YOU CAN SEPARATE SALT AND WATER BY EVAPORATION
Line_3152	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3153	A SOLUTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED HOW YOU MAKE IT IS YOU MIX SOMETHING TOGETHER
Line_3154	UH THE SOLUTE
Line_3155	YOU CAN SEE BY HOW MUCH HOWTHE DIFFERENT THE COLOR
Line_3156	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE SOLUTE AND IT IS DARKER
Line_3157	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3158	THE MORE COLOR IT HAS OR HOW MUCH OR HOW MUCH MORE POWDER IT HAS
Line_3159	THE MORE POWDER IT HAD
Line_3160	THE DARKER OR LIGHTER THE COLOR IS
Line_3161	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_3162	IT IS LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3163	IT WOULD TAST MORE FLAVERFULL
Line_3164	IT WOULD TAST U LESS CONCENTRATED LESS FLAVERFUL
Line_3165	IT IS NOT AS SWEET AND FLAVERFUL
Line_3166	YOU CAN UH DO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER SOWID HAVE LESS IN IT
Line_3167	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER SO  BE MORE SPRED OUT
Line_3168	ADD MORE WATER
Line_3169	BYE
Line_3170	WE ARE WORKING ON MIXTURES AND SOLUTIN
Line_3171	ONES A MIXTURE ONE TO SOLUT
Line_3172	THE FETHER WAS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WAS NIGNTY GRAM
Line_3173	THE ROCK IS ALOUWT HEAVIER THAN TH
Line_3174	WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF IN SCIENCE
Line_3175	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TWENT
Line_3176	ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE THE OTHER HAS TEN GRAMS OF
Line_3177	THE ONE WITH TWENTYGRAMS WILL WEIGHT MOR
Line_3178	MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT THAT TWENGRAM SOLUNTE WEIGHED MOR
Line_3179	BECAUSE ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS THE OTHER HAS TEN
Line_3180	THE GREAT ONE GETS DARKER AND DARKER WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CONCENTRATED AND MORE CONSOET
Line_3181	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST
Line_3182	THE MOST IS ONE THE LEAST IS THREE
Line_3183	ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED TWO IS LESST CONCENTRA
Line_3184	HERE WE AR
Line_3185	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3186	YOU ADD A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT IT IS H
Line_3187	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3188	YOU ADD THINGS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CYOU CAN'T SEPARATE THEM IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_3189	THE FIRST ONE HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND THEREFORE IT IS MORE DENSE
Line_3190	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER SO IT IS MORE
Line_3191	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THEREFORE IT IS MORE
Line_3192	HOW DARK OR LIGHT IT IS OR HOW DENSE OR HOW CONCENTRATING IT IS
Line_3193	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT AND IS THEREFORE LESS AR MORE G
Line_3194	THE DARKER ONES ARE MORE DENSE AND THE LIGHTER ONES ARE LESS DENSE
Line_3195	BECAUSE IT HAS LESS POWDER IN IT
Line_3196	THE DARKER ONE HAS MORE SWING FILLS OF THE DRINK MIXED AND THE OTHER ONE HAS LESS AND IS LESS COLORFUL
Line_3197	MORE IT WOULD HAVE MORE FLAVER
Line_3198	IT WOULDN'T CASE ESS FLAVERFUL
Line_3199	IF YOU ADD MORE SOLVENT
Line_3200	THESE ARE ALL MIXTURES EXCEPT FOR THE WATER AND THE TOP RIGHT I GUESS
Line_3201	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3202	THE MIXTURE OF THE TRAIL MIXES SEPARATING INTO SEPARAT PILES CHOCKLITS NUTS AND RASONS
Line_3203	THEY ARE SEPARATING
Line_3204	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TWO DIFFERENT PILES
Line_3205	THE WATER IS SPLITTING FROM THE MARBLES BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN AND MARBLES CAN'T FIL THROUGH THOSE TINEY SPACES
Line_3206	THE MARBLES SEPARATE FROM THE WATER BECAUSE THERE IS A SCREEN
Line_3207	IT TOOK OUT  ITUM
Line_3208	THE WATER IS NOW CLEAR
Line_3209	IT EVAPORATES
Line_3210	NO
Line_3211	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3212	MIXTURES KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES AND SOLUTIONS MIXED TOGETE
Line_3213	I HAT YOU
Line_3214	SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3215	MIXTURES ARE LIKE SOLODS
Line_3216	A FOSS SIGESCEPALE
Line_3217	NOT SO GOOD
Line_3218	YA'RE LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3219	AKETHE SALT DISSOLVED BUT THE SAND AND THE WATER DIDN'T
Line_3220	THE WATER IS MIXING ITH THE GREAT ASTIC CREAP MIXE AND IT'S MIXING
Line_3221	AH A SOLID U I MOST
Line_3222	I DON'T KNOWI'M GONE TO TALK TO YOU
Line_3223	SOLUTE IS THE SALT
Line_3224	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3225	THE SALT IT'S CALLED
Line_3226	IT IS ALL THE WEIGHT OF THREE OTHER IDUMS TOGETHER
Line_3227	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3228	A SOLUTE
Line_3229	TOLD YOU BEFORE IT'S A SOLVENT
Line_3230	BECAUSE THEY ARE MARY BECAUSE THEY ALE
Line_3231	GOOD BYE MUARREALY
Line_3232	WE'VE BEEN DOING U MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3233	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALAD THE PAPER CLIPS THIS WOOD AND THE BE
Line_3234	THE SALAD HAS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THEN
Line_3235	THEY ARE MIXED UNLIKE THE OTHER PILES
Line_3236	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE SAND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3237	THE RASONS THE EMINIMS AND THE NUTS WERE ALL MIXED TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3238	THEY USE TO BE MIXED ALLTOGETHER BUT NOW THEY'RE NOT
Line_3239	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AN SIZES AND COLOR
Line_3240	YOU SEPARATED THE MARBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3241	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE SEPARATE NOW
Line_3242	WIRE WE WARE FLOWTING HEAD ON A PETISTUL
Line_3243	THE WATER UM IS NOW SEPARATED FROM THE SAND SO  THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE THINGS
Line_3244	THEY GOT FILTER DIDN'T THEY
Line_3245	YOU USED A SPECIAL TIPE OF TOL TO FILTURE THE SAND FROM THE WATER
Line_3246	THE SALT AND WATER DISSOLVES THE DERA WATER DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS  AR IS JUST A MIXTURE
Line_3247	IT'S DISSOLVING SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE SALT
Line_3248	MAY BE YOU JUST NEED TO I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU E QUESTION
Line_3249	IT WAS FILTERED BY THAT BLUE FILTERING MASHIN
Line_3250	THE WATER WILL GET DISSOLMBED
Line_3251	NO BECAUSE IT UM MIXED IN WITH THE WATER SO YOULD HAVE  SO YOU CANT
Line_3252	I DON'T KNOW MARNEY TELL ME WHI
Line_3253	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR FOULLE BODY
Line_3254	YOU SHOW ME YOUR WHOLE BODY PLEASE
Line_3255	WHYE D YOU CKICK ME THE MARBLES MARNEY
Line_3256	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND THE SAND MADE THE UM AND THE SAND MADE THE WATER VERY VERY DIERTY
Line_3257	CAN YOU REPEAT MY CENTANCE YOU CICKED ME IN THE BAROLVE
Line_3258	THE SALT DISAPPEARS AND IT EVAPORATED WHILE THE SAND IT JUST SANK TO THE BOTTOM AND MADE THE WATER DIRTY
Line_3259	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT LIKE THE GREAPE STUFF UM IT LIKE A IT'S A THE WANDER ABOUT HUNDRED BUBBDB
Line_3260	THE SALT DISSOLVES UNLIKE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE SAND AND WATER IT LIKE SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND MAKES THE WATER ALL DIRTY I HAT YOUR FACE BARNEY
Line_3261	THEY'RE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY EQUAL FIFTY GRAM
Line_3262	THE SALT ADDED WEIGHT TO THE WATER SO NOW IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS RATHER THAN FIFTY GRAM
Line_3263	THAT IF YOU STILL CANT SEE IT YOU STILL HA WEIGHT TO IT DON'T YOU
Line_3264	SOME OF THEM DISSOLVE LIKE THE SALT AND SOME OF THEM DON'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SAND
Line_3265	THEY ALL GOT MIXED TOGETHER SO NOW IT'S A WHOLE MIXTURE
Line_3266	ESS IS GETTING MARGER BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING THREE DIFFERENT THING
Line_3267	THAT FIFTY GRAMS IS EQUAL TO ONE CUP OF UM WATER
Line_3268	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME THE ANSWER
Line_3269	I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FILTER
Line_3270	THE FLOWER MIXED WITH THE WATER CAN BE FILTERED SO THE WATER AND THE FLOWER CAN BE SEPARATED AGAIN
Line_3271	HIS MEANS THAT M ITS STILL AND A MIXTURE SO THE SALT IS STILL IN THE WATER
Line_3272	THE CECTRICK ASID COULD NOT BE FILTERED OUT
Line_3273	AFTER THE DAYS IT'S THE WASHER DISSOLVED AND NOW THEY HAVE THESE SALT SQUERE
Line_3274	THE WATER IS GONE AND THE SALT IS STILL THERE EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T SEE IT IN THE MIXTURE
Line_3275	YOU CAN FILTER OUT THE SALT FROM THE WATER
Line_3276	THAT OVER TIME THE WATER EVAPORATES AND NOW THE SALT IS BACK AND SQUARES NOT CRYSTAL

Line_3278	IS MY UFRIEND EFEROM VERY IGNERENTS OR IS HE NOT I HE'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT
Line_3279	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIO
Line_3280	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBLES AND WATER
Line_3281	I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS ONE BECAUSE UM YOU IT'S A VERY EFFICHIANT WEIGH T
Line_3282	UH CAM BARNY ARE YOU FAT
Line_3283	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE SAND
Line_3284	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE IB O Y UAS
Line_3285	BRINK A MAGNET TO GET ALL THE UM THE PAPER CLIPS OUT SO FROM THE SAND AND SIDE
Line_3286	YOU ARE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE SAND AND WATER
Line_3287	I AM TALKING TO A WOMAN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAT
Line_3288	THIS IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE CORRE
Line_3289	THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S MAGNET IWN
Line_3290	IT'S NOT TO RIGHT ONE MORENEY BECAUSE UM WAS ALL BE ON YOUR SIDE
Line_3291	YOU ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE PEBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3292	YOU USE THE UM COFFY FILTER TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SAM
Line_3293	SALT WATER DISSOLVED ENNOUNCED THE SALT PIECE
Line_3294	THE SALT WATER IS EVAPORATING SO THE SELT IS BACK
Line_3295	HAT YOU PUT THE SALT WATER IN THAT THICK IN A BOBBER AND NOW IT DISSOLVED WATER DISSOLVED SO  EAH
Line_3296	ABOUT HOW EVAPORATION CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE SOLUTN
Line_3297	ARE YOU HTHAT OR ARE EVEN NOT
Line_3298	I STEAEL VERY TIERE
Line_3299	WE'VE BEEN BEEN TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE IN SCIENCE MORNIN
Line_3300	USING A FILTER
Line_3301	VERY TTHE ARSIR
Line_3302	ABOUT MIXTURES AND SEIIUTE SHONES
Line_3303	A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTE

Line_3305	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3306	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DARKER THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
Line_3307	THE DARKER ONE HAS THE MOLE MOST SOLUTION IN I
Line_3308	THE DARKER COLORD SOLUTIONS YOU CAN VARALLY SEE THROUGH THE THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM VERY EASILY
Line_3309	YOU PLIGED A SOLM FOR MENG PLEASE
Line_3310	ONE HAS FIFTY MILLINITERS OF WATER AND FIVE SPOONFULS AND ONE HAS FIFTY MILLINITERS OF WATER AND ONE SPOONFUL
Line_3311	IT WOULD TAST ALT MORE UM FLAVER HAS A LOT MORE FLAVER IN IT THAN THE ONE SPOON FUL
Line_3312	THE ONE WITH SIX SPOONFULS IS MORE CONCENTRATED THE THE ONE THAN THE ONE WITH THREE SPOON
Line_3313	IT WOULD TASTE VERY WASHEREY
Line_3314	IRED TO DMOURNEY
Line_3315	I'M DOING GOOD MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_3316	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING INTRESTING IN SCIENCE
Line_3317	THE GRET MIX IS PURPLE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS CLEAR THE SALT IS TRAMPTRANSPARENT
Line_3318	UM YOU CAN BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_3319	THE FETHER IS TWO GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAMS THE ROCK IS GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3320	ETHER WEIGHS LESS THAN THE WROCK
Line_3321	MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT MARNEY THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE IS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_3322	ONE HAS OREGRAMS ONE HAS TEGRAMS SO NE E GRAMS WILL BE HEVVIER
Line_3323	THE SALT WATER LOOKS THE SAME AND THE GREAT MIX URE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS
Line_3324	THEY ARE ALL UM NOT EVEN
Line_3325	ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3326	I HEAT YOUR MARNEY SO MUCH YOU'RE TINA CREEPY BT YOU HELPD ME WITH SIENCE SO THANKS
Line_3327	I FIEEL LIKE I AM GETTING THE OTHER BULB I' STINKING
Line_3328	LEARNING ABOUT NU CIELARAM MICLES
Line_3329	IT IT'S IFARREND IT WOULD BE
Line_3330	IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT POWDER ON THE LEFT IS MIXED IN WITH THOUT WATER
Line_3331	YOU MIX SOMETHING WITH WASHER THAT MAKES TA SOLUT
Line_3332	YOU MAKE THE SALT WITH THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3333	THE WATER CANT HOLD ANY MORE SALT SO IT'S SCETLING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_3334	THE IROSION SALTS OR EPSOM SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE
Line_3335	Y EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTUM
Line_3336	THE SALT EPSOM SALT IS AT THE BOTTOM SO THE WATER CAN HOLD ANY MORE
Line_3337	THE WATER IS SATURATED CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE WATER OR SALT
Line_3338	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WANE
Line_3339	THE SALT SOLUTION IS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS WHICH SO IT MEANS THE SALT IS SEVENTEEN GRAMS IND THER
Line_3340	SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS OF UM SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS IS LEVELE WITH THE SOLUTIO
Line_3341	GOOD I FIELL A GREAT MORNEE BUT Y NOT
Line_3342	MY OBNOCIOUS FRIENDS JANE AND EPRUM KEEP TALKING SO I CAN'T TELL YOU I'M SORY MARNEY
Line_3343	YOU PUT SHOOGER CITRIC ACIDS AND EM EP SOM SALT INTO THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_3344	YOU ARE MIXING THE CECTRIC ASID AND EM EMROSAM SALT TOGETHER
Line_3345	THE WATER IS SO SATURATED THOT NONE OF NO MORE EPOM SALT OR CETRIC ASID CAN GO IN
Line_3346	THE SHOGAER IS WEIGHTS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE EPSOOM SALT AND THE CIDRIC ASID
Line_3347	I GOET THE MOVES LIKE JAG I GOD  BUS LIKE J
Line_3348	I DON'T KNOW BUT COLMAN ONES ON DON'T GET A CON
Line_3349	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS MARNEY BUT IT IT SAYS  SOUBILITY CHE
Line_3350	SO LE SATURATED WINDO ITS Y I NO MORE SALT LEF OVER SO AN YOU HAVE TO FILLTR ITUL GAY
Line_3351	I THINK IT'S SUBCITANCE SORTY
Line_3352	IT'S CROSSING THE OFF MTHE CRYSTAL IDENTIFACATION AN WASHER
Line_3353	THE EEPRONIUM SALT IS LIKE
Line_3354	GOOD SOMETHING
Line_3355	UI THINK EPROSUM SALT IS ON THE DISC
Line_3356	WHEN YOU PUT VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA TOGETHER THEY'RE THEY MAKE A CEMICAL REACTION WHICH MAKES IT ALL BUBBLY
Line_3357	THE PRODUCT
Line_3358	THE CITRIC ASID BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3359	THE CONTRACT OR SOMETHING
Line_3360	YOU MIXED ALL THEM TOGETHER
Line_3361	THEY'RE JUST MISSING THE WATER
Line_3362	AT'S WATER WITH THE BAKING SODA IS LIKE UM FILZING
Line_3363	THEY'RE BLUE WIGHT AND SILVER
Line_3364	THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT ATUMS
Line_3365	THE BAKING SODAS ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE VINEGAR HAS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT
Line_3366	NO THEY LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
Line_3367	MEANS THEY MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3368	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3369	WELL A MIXTURE OF BAKING SOD AND HALCEEVMAN CHLORIDE
Line_3370	PARTICIPATE TEN
Line_3371	WHEN YOU PUT SODIAM HOUK SIDE AND FIFEN FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WITH HIDROLICK ASSID IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
Line_3372	WHAT ARE THE PURPLE AUMS
Line_3373	TWO OF THEM ARE PURPLE THEY ALL USE TO BE BLU
Line_3374	YOU CAN UM DISSOLVE IT YOU PUT IT OUT ON THE TRAY AND IT DISSOLVES SO YOU CAN FIND THE ATTLM
Line_3375	UM IT GOT  WATERY ON THE OUTSIDE TWO
Line_3376	YOU HAD CALCIUM CLORID AT THE BOTTOME WHAT HOW DO YOU GET THIK
Line_3377	THE CARBONATED WATER IS SO CARBONATED THAT IT IT CANT STOP MOVING WITH THE CARBONATION
Line_3378	IT REACTED BUT IT LIKE FILZED UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY FESD
Line_3379	THERE IS NO REACTION
Line_3380	IT WENT FROM RAINY TO SNOWY AND  TO DIRTY AND THE COUNTER FELL OFF
Line_3381	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3382	THE BIKE A RUSTS ON IT AT THE END OF THE YER SO THAT MEANS IT DOESN' HAVE BECOMAL REACTON
Line_3383	IT'S GLOWING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
Line_3384	ONCE YOU SNAP THE TICK THE STUFF INSIDE IT MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT CAN GLOW
Line_3385	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE IT TURNS PURPLE GOOD BYE MONE
Line_3386	NO IT'S A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
Line_3387	YOU STUCK BARNEY I HATE YOU SO MUCH
Line_3388	TIRED REALLY REALLY TIRED
Line_3389	A REACTION DIDN'T ACCUR NO THING FISIY HAPPENED
Line_3390	CALCIUM CORRIDE AND THE BAKING SODA HAD A REACTION AND IT MADE IT FILSIP
Line_3391	OH  AND THE SOLID IS A PRODUCT AND IT'S YELLOW
Line_3392	IT'S SIX DY GRAMS TOGETHER
Line_3393	A REACTAIMT PLUSS REACTANE EQUALS THE PRODUCT SO TWENTY FIVE PLUS THIRTY FIVE EQUAL SIXTY
Line_3394	THAT THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3395	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN IS FIFTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IS SIXTY ONE
Line_3396	BECAUSE THE ONE PUT THE BAG UP AND LET THE GASSES OUT
Line_3397	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_3398	WELL THERE ARE THINGS MIXED TOGETHER AND THIS IN THESE THINGS
Line_3399	THE FIRST PILE IS MIXED TOGETHER AND THE A THE SECONT PILE IS THREE PILES THAT ARE THE SAME TIPES
Line_3400	WELL UM IN THE LFE PILE THERE ARE UM THE STUFF MIXED TOGETHER THE BEANS MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3401	BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE HEY'RE BEING SPLITD A PART INTO EAT INTO GROUPS THAT ARE THE SAME TIPE
Line_3402	THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING SPLIT INTO PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME
Line_3403	INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED TO WITH THEIR OWN KIND
Line_3404	THE WATERS ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER WHERE THE MARBLES ARE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3405	R BEING SEPARATED AND AND THE UM MARBALS WE'RE BEING FILTERED OUT OF THE OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3406	WELL THE SAND IS A SOLID SO IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH PAPER SO AS SPEER BEING SEPARATED
Line_3407	THEY SEPARATED SO NOW THE WATER IS IS UMUM PURIFIED WHAT IS PURE WATER AND THE DIRT THERE ARE THE SAND IS JUST NOW SAND
Line_3408	THE SAND AND WATER ARE BEING SEPARATED AND TO EACH INTO GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN CO
Line_3409	THEY'RE BEING MIXED TOGETHER THE SENT THE SANT AND DRAR BEING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3410	IT LOOKS LIKE THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER BUT THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3411	OKAY UM
Line_3412	THE WATER MAKES THE SALT DISSOLVE AND THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER TO CREATE THE MIX THE UHM SOLUTION
Line_3413	THE THE IT'S BEING THE WATER'S BEING UM SEPARATED FROM THE DIRT
Line_3414	IT'S A TIPE OF MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3415	WILL BECOME PART OF THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3416	THE GREAP DSE PROBABLY CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3417	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3418	THEY'RE MIXING TWO THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE IT A MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3419	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SANDJEL SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND STAYES THERE
Line_3420	I THINK IT MUGHT BE PULING IT MAI DISSOLVE INTO THE GREAT DUOS SO THE GREAT DOSE MIGHT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATE
Line_3421	WELL I THINK THE SALT'S GOING DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS ON
Line_3422	I THINK THE SOLVENT IS THE SOLT BECAUSE IT'S GONN DISSOLVE INTO THE WATE
Line_3423	THAT BASICALLY THEY'RE JUST ADDING TEN GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS PLUSS TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS SO THE THE SOLUTION IS FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3424	BACALY JUST ADDING THEM UP
Line_3425	THAT SOLUTE THAT SOLUTION CAN WEIGH MORE THAN THE UM SOLVENT AND THE SOL
Line_3426	THE MASS IS GETTING HEAVIER AND DENSER
Line_3427	IT WEIGHS JUST AS MUCH AS THE INDIVIDUAL UM UH COMPONENTS
Line_3428	THAT I THAT IT EDDS UP
Line_3429	BY FIGING OUT THE PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE EACH ON
Line_3430	THAT IT MIXES WITH THE WATER AND IT STAHS AND THE WATER CAUSAS ALSO
Line_3431	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE LIQUID WITH A LIQUID IT'S REALLYIT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MTO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UM SEPARA
Line_3432	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3433	IT'S EVAPORATING FROM THE WA THE WATER IS EVAPORATING
Line_3434	MAKES A LIQUID WITH UM UWITH A SOLID THEN YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT TO TO SEPARATE IT
Line_3435	THE SALT IS LEFT AND IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATED
Line_3436	THAT THEY'RE MIXING THE SALT AND THE WATER AND THAT JUST THEN THE WATER IS EVAPORATING IN THE SALT IS MAKING SALT CRYSTALS
Line_3437	UN SUNELIGHT AND LIGHT AND HEAT MOSTLY HEAT
Line_3438	HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR TO EVAPORATE TO
Line_3439	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3440	THAT A MIXTURE IS WHEN YOU MIX SOMETHING TO MIX ONE MIX ONE THING WITH ANOTHER THING
Line_3441	IF THERE IS IF THERE IS LIKE OU'F YOU'RE TRYING TO MICKE UM GET A ROCK OUT OF MAGNETI THEN YOU COULD USE A MAGNET TO GET MAGNETI
Line_3442	HEY'RE SEPARATING THE WROCKS OR THE PEBLES FROM THE WATER
Line_3443	THAT THE ROCK CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WATER CAN SO IT'S FRESHENING UP THE WATER
Line_3444	THE ROCKS STAND TOP AND THE WATER GOES THROUGHE TO THE OTHER CUP
Line_3445	THE THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS THAT THE WRATHE THE WATER AND THE LIKE MUD IN IT OR WHATEVER IS GOING THROUGHE AND THE R THE PEBLES ARE STANDING ON TOP
Line_3446	THAT THE MAGN THAT THE MAGNET TOOK UP THE SAFETY PENS
Line_3447	UH WELL FOR THIS ONE W'RE USING MAGNETIT TO SEPARATEON
Line_3448	A SOL A SOL AND A SOLUTE
Line_3449	I NE GET SOMETHING WITH MAGNETITS AND WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO GET IT OUT
Line_3450	THAT THE ROCKS SE ON TOP OR THE PEBLES STAIED ON TOP AND THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3451	BECAUSE BECAUSE A PARTICAL SIZED TO GET THE ROCKS ON TOP AND THE WATER THROUGHE
Line_3452	THAT BECAUSE THE LITTLE MOCK WITH THE LITTLE TINEY PEBLES CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER BUT THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH IT SOON
Line_3453	CAUSE LITHE LITTLE PEBLES CAN GO THROUGH IT
Line_3454	THAT USE THAT ONE BECAUSE IT THIS THE SN THE WATER WOULD EVAPORATE BUT THE SALT WOULD STAY THERE
Line_3455	THAT THAT THE UM SETTHE SALTS WILL STAY THERE AND THE WATER WILL GO AWAY
Line_3456	WELL WE LEARNED ABOUT TOOLS A LOT MORE ABOUT SOLUTES AND SOLIVENTS
Line_3457	JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I HARD YOU SAY SOLUTION
Line_3458	MIXTURES ARE WHEN YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES OR MORE TOGETHER
Line_3459	BY USING WATER EVAPORATION MAY BE MAGNETISM
Line_3460	THREE THE PERSONS USING A MAGNET TO GET THE PINS OUT
Line_3461	THEY'RE USING A SCREEN TO SORTION THE ROCKS FROM THE WATE
Line_3462	THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE WROCK ST ON TOP OF IT SO YURE SEPARATING THE WAROCKS FROM THE WATE
Line_3463	WROCKS AND THE WATER GETS SEPARATED AND THE WATER GOES DOWN BUT THE ROCK STAY ON TOP
Line_3464	BECAUSE THE WROCKS AND PARTICALE SIZED THEM SO THAT THE ROCK
Line_3465	BECAUSEYOU NEED TO GET THE MAGNET THE MAGNET THE UM THE THE MAGNETS OUT SO THAT SO THAT TO USE A MAGNE
Line_3466	BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT TWOOLES CAN HELP WITH DIFFERENT PROBLUMS AND MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3467	YO GET THE PINS OUT BECAUSE THE PINS  ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNET
Line_3468	I NOTICE THAT THE WROCK STAY ON TOP AND THE WATER STAYS ON THE BOTTOM R THE WALTHE WATER GOES THROUGH THE SEEV
Line_3469	BCAUSE THE WROCKS CAN GET THROUGH THE SEE BUT THE WATER AND THE MOOD CAN
Line_3470	I SEE THAT THE SAND OR WHATEVER IT IS STAYES ON TOP AND THEN THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3471	THE WATER CAN LEAK THROUGH THE FEET FILTER BUT THE UM SAND CAN
Line_3472	MEANS THAT THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE INTO A CLOUD AND THE SALTS WILL STAY THE THE SALT WILL STAY THERE AND MAKE LITTLE CRYSTAL
Line_3473	I THINK IT'S A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S MOSTLY A SOLUTION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A MIXTURE
Line_3474	I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TWOOLS HELP WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURESBYE
Line_3475	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIX SOLUTION
Line_3476	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3477	CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT
Line_3478	THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_3479	THE LEFT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3480	THE SALT AN WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3481	THEY GET SEPARATED
Line_3482	THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY WERE BEFORE
Line_3483	THE WATER LEAKED THROUGH THE THING AND THE MARBLE STAID ON TOP
Line_3484	THE WATER WENT THROUGH AND THE MARBLES DIDN'T
Line_3485	THE MARBLES STAED
Line_3486	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT DISAPPEARES IN WATER
Line_3487	THE SALT DISAPPEARS
Line_3488	IT DIUPERS THE
Line_3489	WHAT'S
Line_3490	IT AM SO GOOD
Line_3491	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3492	THEY'RE ALL MIXTURES
Line_3493	SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE WATER
Line_3494	BLEABLBLEAD'S ARING I DON'T EVER KNOW WR
Line_3495	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS SEPARATED
Line_3496	THE RIGHT PILE IS SEPARATED
Line_3497	MIXTURES
Line_3498	TIS THE
Line_3499	THEY'RE SEPARATED ALL OF THE
Line_3500	THE CANDY THE PEANETS AND THE RAISONS ARE ALL IN SEPARATE PILES NOW
Line_3501	THERE IS SEPARATED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_3502	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SIFT AND THE MARBLES DID NOT
Line_3503	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_3504	THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER CAME OUT CLEAR
Line_3505	THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_3506	ONE EXAMPLE IS SHOOGER INTO TE AND SALT INTO WATER AND WHEN SOMETHING DISSOLVES IT USUALLY COMES BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM
Line_3507	IF YOU JUST PUT IF YOU PUT THE SALT INTO THE WATER IT WON'T DISSOLVE
Line_3508	SOLUTION
Line_3509	THE SALT WILL GET THE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IT
Line_3510	IT'S DIFFICALT TO GET BACK BUT IT'S DEFENANTELY POSSIBLE
Line_3511	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS
Line_3512	THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES AND THE SAND DOESN'T
Line_3513	MIXTURE
Line_3514	THE SAND IS A SOLUTION AND THE SALT ISEN'T
Line_3515	I BELIEAVE THE WROLE THE WATER PLAING IS A SOUTE
Line_3516	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_3517	A SOLUTE
Line_3518	THE SALT IS THA SOLVENT SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS A SOLVENT
Line_3519	TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALES FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3520	FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLACE FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT WATER
Line_3521	WHEN YOU ADD THE MASSES TOGETHER THEY EQUAL THE END RESULT
Line_3522	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THE UM MASS OF A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION YOU GET THE ENDING MA
Line_3523	TWENTY PUS TWENTY PLUS TEN EQUALES FIFTY GRAMS
Line_3524	NO MASS IS LOS OR GANED IN THIS PROSESS
Line_3525	ITTHE WEIGHT IS CON SERVED
Line_3526	COINSORVATION OF MASS
Line_3527	YOU CAN DO THAT IN A MIXTURE
Line_3528	THE SALT STAED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER WENT THROUGH
Line_3529	IT MEANS THAT IT WAS A MIXTURE WHEN WE STARTED
Line_3530	THE CITRIC ASID STAED IN THE PAPER AND THEN THE WATER FILTER THROUGH
Line_3531	IT'S ACTUALLY A SOLUTION
Line_3532	YOU MIGHT USE EVAPORATION
Line_3533	THE WATER IS EEVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT CRYSTALS BEHIND
Line_3534	THE EVAPORATION WHEN WEILL WHEN WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES UP INTO THE SKI
Line_3535	IT GOES UP INTO THE SKIE
Line_3536	TIME PASSING
Line_3537	I'M WONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
Line_3538	EVAPORATION IS ONE WAY TO SEPARATE MIXTURE OF A
Line_3539	THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3540	THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GETTING EXTRACTED FROM THE DRY MIXTURE BY THE PROPERTY OF MAGNETISM
Line_3541	MIX  MIXTURES ARE MIX
Line_3542	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3543	YOU PURT ONE LIQUID INTO ANOTHER SOLIED
Line_3544	ONE WATER MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLOR THAM THE OTHER
Line_3545	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SOLUTION IN IT
Line_3546	THE GLASS ON THE RIGHT HAS A DARKER COLOR
Line_3547	THERE IS MORE POWDER AN THE GRU GLASS ON THE LEFT RIGHT I MEAN I MEANT
Line_3548	THE MASS OF THE CONCENTRATED WATER
Line_3549	THE COLAR AND THE MASS
Line_3550	THEY ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE REST
Line_3551	BECAUSE THE LIGHTER COLORS HAS HAVE LESS CONCENTRATION IN THEM
Line_3552	MORE SHOGEARIY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3553	IT HAS LESS FLAVERING IN IT
Line_3554	BY ADDING WATER
Line_3555	YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE SOLUTION
Line_3556	YOU TAKE AWAY SOME SOLUTION
Line_3557	BYE MARNI
Line_3558	MONE I'M DO IN OKABE
Line_3559	SO TODAY WE WORKED ON HOW CONCENTRATED THINGS MIGHT BE LIKE HOW CONCENTRATED FRUT PUNCH MIGHT BE
Line_3560	THE CORK IS MORE DENSE THAN THE PENIY
Line_3561	IT WILL FLOWT
Line_3562	IT THINKS
Line_3563	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HOW CONCENTRATED WATER CAN GET WHEN YOU ADD CONCENTRATED POWER
Line_3564	THE FETHER IS LIGHTER AND THE ROCK IS HEAVIER
Line_3565	BECAUSE WHEN THE SOLLUTE DISSOLVES IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY IT JUST IT STAYES TWENTY GRAMS AND TEN GRAMS EVEN WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED
Line_3566	THE LAST GRAPE DRINK MIX IS THE MORE THE MOST CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_3567	YOU WEIGH THEM
Line_3568	NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_3569	NUMBER BAA GESS
Line_3570	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3571	WELL A MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION
Line_3572	THE CORCK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENY AND THAT'S WHY THE WATER IS CARRYING
Line_3573	AN OBJECT THAT IS LESS DENSE WILL FLOW INSTEAD OF THINK
Line_3574	IT'LL FLOWT
Line_3575	ITL SANK MARNEY
Line_3576	SOLUTION A WILL BE MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTE
Line_3577	IF A LIQUID IS MORE CONCENTRATED IF IT'S MORE LIKELY WHEN YOU DROP SOMETHING IT IT WILL FLOWT
Line_3578	SOLUTION B IS MORE SATURATED THAN SOLUTION A BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SALT INTO WATER THE SALT WON'T ALWAYS DISSOLVE
Line_3579	THE LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3580	SOLUTION B IS MORE DENSE SO IT WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT SOLUTION A IS LESS DENSE SO IT WILL RISE TO THE TOP
Line_3581	THE LESS END WILL RISE TO THE TOP AND THE MORE DENSEL SIT TO THE BOTTOM
Line_3582	IT'LL LEAYER ON ON THE VERY TOP
Line_3583	ONE PUTS SOLUTION A ON THE BOTTOM AND SOLUTION B ON THE TOP
Line_3584	BECAUSE AS ONE IS MORE DENSE THAN THE OTHER AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE INCORRECT ORDER THE'LL SINK I MEAN THOT MIXED
Line_3585	GOD
Line_3586	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION AND LIQUID
Line_3587	THE SHIOGER IS THE MOST SATURATED AND UM THE KILMASON RIGHT NOW
Line_3588	TWELVE GRAM S AND MEANS SUBSTANCE THREE
Line_3589	WHEN YOU EVAPORATE THE CITRIC ASID EPSOM SALT AND REGULAR SALT THE CRYSTALS MAY FORM DIFFERENT PATTERIN
Line_3590	GOULD BYE O OH IT'S DOING IT IT'S ONE FIFTY I GOT TO GO BIYE
Line_3591	AY AR SOLID
Line_3592	WATER AND MARBLES WATER IS A SOLT R IS A LIQUID AND MARBLES ARE A SALT
Line_3593	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_3594	MARNEY THEY SEPARATE NEHMS MARNE MAXKS SERIES BUT IT'S MARNEY THEY SEPARATE
Line_3595	THEY SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT PIECES
Line_3596	THE MOUNT A SAND APPLE E STRAINER AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH
Line_3597	WELL THE MARBLES ARE ON TOP THE STRAINER AND THE WATER RUNE THROUGH
Line_3598	THE SAND GOT CAUT IN THE SEPARATOR AND THE WATER WENT STREAGHT THROUGH I
Line_3599	DP SALT MIXES TOGETHER WHERE AS THE PAPER CLIPS AND WHICH CLIPS STONED UP
Line_3600	NO BECAUSE THY UM GREAP TLAPPSTIC STUF TI
Line_3601	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIO
Line_3602	THEY ARE MIXING THE SAND AND WATER TO MAKE A SOUL
Line_3603	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVE

Line_3627	THEY ARE MORE DIOLUTED
Line_3628	IT HAS MORE WATER AND LESS POWDER
Line_3629	ONE HAS MORE GRE THE ONE THAT HAS MORE GRE POWER IS TACE MORE LIKE TACE MORE LIKE GREP
Line_3630	IT WOULD TASTE A LOT MORE LIKE WATER THAN THE GRE FLABERING
Line_3631	IT TAES AWLB UN LIKE WATERT
Line_3632	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER BUT KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT AS GREAP CASTICK STUFF
Line_3633	BY ADDING MORE OR LESS SWATER
Line_3634	WE ARE FINDING MISTRR A  O MISTERRY SOL
Line_3635	IT IS SALT AND WATER MIXED TOGETHER
Line_3636	IT IS SATURATED FOULLY SATURATE
Line_3637	THE MORE SALT YOU ADD THE MORE WATER LIKE THE HIGHER THE WATER GET
Line_3638	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER CAN NOT WHOLD ANYMORE SALT
Line_3639	AFTER THREE SCOOP SCOOPS OF EPSON SALT THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED AND NO MORE SALT CAN DISSOLVE
Line_3640	THE WATER BECOMES FULLY SATURATED WHICH MEANS NO MORE IT CAN HOLD ANY MORE SALT
Line_3641	THE SOLUTION IS NO LONGER SOLLUABLE
Line_3642	THE SHOGER IS MORE SOLUABLE THAN THE EPSOM SALT WHICH MEANS MORE SHOGER CAN DISSOLVE IN THE WI
Line_3643	ITS NO LONGER SOLUTBUL
Line_3644	THE SALT ADDS MORE MASS
Line_3645	IT TOOK FORCE SCOOPS FOR THE WATER TO COMPLETE BE COMPLETELY SOLSOLSATURATED WITH E CITRIC ASID AND SIX SCOOPS TO BE
Line_3646	SHOGER IS SIX SCOOPS MORE SOLUBLE I MEAN TWO SCOOPS MORE SOLUABLE THAN TRIC
Line_3647	SHOGAR IS TWO MORE SCOPS VALUABLE THEN F THECITRIC ACID
Line_3648	SOME DISSOLVE MORE AN PLAM MORE IN WATER BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE SOLUTAB
Line_3649	THE WATER GAMS MASS BECAUSE OF THE SALT THAT IS GOING INTO
Line_3650	CITRIC ASSID IS THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM EPSON SALT IS THE ONE ON THE TOP LEFT AND SALT IS THE ONE ON THESE  RIGHT
Line_3651	I THINK IT IS EPSOM SAL
Line_3652	I THINK THEY ARE MADE OF EPSOM SALT
Line_3653	THERE WIS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AND THEN THE  TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES MIX TOGETHER TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CALLES SALT
Line_3654	THE SOLUTE MADE THE  REACTION REACT
Line_3655	THE SOLUTION IN THE BAG CAUSE A REACTION THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS STEEL OR CARBON DIOCSIDE AND THE BAG

Line_3759	IT'S SALT
Line_3760	I CAN DO A EXCECTRIC ASID I SWARE TO GOD
Line_3761	THE CHEMICALS OF BAKING SODA AND VINEGAR MIXED AND IT CREATED A CHEMICAL THAT MADE A REACTION TO MAKE IT FIZ
Line_3762	A REACTION CALED AR SOLUTION
Line_3763	A SOLUTION I SAID THAT
Line_3764	MIXTURES OF OF CIL HELP ME OUT HERE
Line_3765	EIR IS INSIDE THE BAG AND THE WATER IS SO CLEAR YOU HARDLY CAN SEE IT
Line_3766	THEY'RE JUST STUFF MIX THEGEOTHER BUT THEY KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
Line_3767	CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3768	WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS CAN WE LEARN ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOW
Line_3769	IT'S A MIXTURE AND THE I M
Line_3770	ACTUALLY WE'RE ACTUAL OARING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND NOT
Line_3771	WELL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_3772	UM SO THE SAND IS GOING INTO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS GOING INTO THE TO THE WATER AND THE SALT IS DISSOLVING
Line_3773	UM THE SALT UM DISSOLVED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SALT IS A DISSOLVING MATERIAL
Line_3774	THE WATER IS PLAN IN THE  IT'S THE GREAT TASTIC THING IS PLAIN DOS SOLT
Line_3775	UM NHAMED FOR THE WATTAL IS A SOLVENT
Line_3776	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER
Line_3777	WE CALL THAT THE SOLVENT
Line_3778	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU PLAS TO WATER WITH SALT IT ECUALES SALT WATER AND SALT WATER WOULD BE HEAVIER THEN WATER BECAUSE IT HAS TO SALT IN
Line_3779	IT TELLS ME THAT ALL THE THE WEIGHTS STAGS THE SAME IN THE PROPERTY STRA
Line_3780	THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ADD A MATERIAL TOGETHER UM YOU ARE THE PRODUCT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAM
Line_3781	IT'S NOT THE SAME UH THE OKAY OLKAYOU ARE SO
Line_3782	THE MASS UM INCREASES BY FIFTEEN
Line_3783	THAT IT IS A CORRECT ADITION PROBLUM
Line_3784	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_3785	THIS MEANS THAT THE SANT I MEAN THE SALT IS STILL THERE
Line_3786	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3787	IT'S ACTUALLY A MIXTURE
Line_3788	YOU CAN ONLY GET IT OUT IN A MIXTURE FORT YOU CAN DO IT AS SOLUTION IF IF IT'S LIKE SALT AND WATER YOU CAN EVAPORATE IT
Line_3789	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SOLUTION
Line_3790	IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_3791	IT'S EVAPORATING SO YOU CAN SEE THE SALT THE SALT IS STELL THERE
Line_3792	IT IS EVAPARRATING I'VE TOLD YOU SEVERAL TIMES
Line_3793	YOU COULD EVAPORATE IT IN STD
Line_3794	BYE YOU HAVE NIE STG
Line_3795	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE A SOLUTION
Line_3796	WE CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE BY USING MAGNETIS
Line_3797	YOU COULD USE DENCITY MAGNETISM
Line_3798	WELL THE MIXTURE IS WITH GRAVEL AND WATER BUT WHEN YOU PURE IT THROUGH A SCREEN ONLY THE WATER GOES THROUGH THE GRAVEL STAYS ON THE SCREE
Line_3799	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT THE PROPERTY SIZED OF WATER
Line_3800	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PARNICAL SIZED
Line_3801	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_3802	IT WAS PARTICAL SIZE DISOLVTATION AND MAGNETISEM
Line_3803	PROPERTIES TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3804	BECAUSE U THERE'S SOLIDS
Line_3805	BEBECAUSE WATER WOULDN'T WORK BCAUSETHER'S MORE THAN ONE THING AND ONLY THE PAPER CLIPS WOULD STICK TO THAT SO THAT'S AN EXILENT WAY TO SEPARATE I
Line_3806	BECAUSE ALL MIXTURES ARE DIFFERENT
Line_3807	BECAUSE MAGNET HAS MAGNETISM AND PAPER CLIPS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_3808	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIGGER SIZE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
Line_3809	BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES CAN GO THROUGH BUT THE BIG ROCKS CAN'T GO THROUGH
Line_3810	WE USED A FILTER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBY COULD USE IT WITH THE CARVREEN IDON'T KNOW WAIT NO NO I DO'
Line_3811	CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE ON TO HE NEXT
Line_3812	THAT YOU'RE SEPARATING THE
Line_3813	IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_3814	BARNS UH MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS IS E V A
Line_3815	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SALT SOLUTION
Line_3816	YOU'RE USING GREAP SE UM AND THERE IS ONE MORE CONCENTRATED AND ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATED
Line_3817	YOU CAN TELL IT BY WEIGHING IN IT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED OR ONE'S LESS CONCENTRATE
Line_3818	YOU CAN DETERMEN THE BY WHICH IS MORE MORE CONCENTRATED AND WHICH IS MORE DILUTE
Line_3819	ONE HAS MORE POWERDER AND ONE HAS LESS POWDER
Line_3820	THE DARKER COLORS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGTRI COLORS AND THE LECTRICCARNORS ARE MORE DIELUTE
Line_3821	WELL WITH LESS GRE POWER WEI TASTS OR BE BORIN AND THE ONE WITH MORE WILL TAST MORE GRAPIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE GRITASTIC
Line_3822	IT WOULD TASTE MORE WATERY
Line_3823	IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE ONE IS MORE STRONGER AND IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAT MAKES IT STRONG AND THE ONE THIT'S MORE DILUTE IS NOT STRONG
Line_3824	I'M GOOD
Line_3825	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SALT SOLUTIONS
Line_3826	WELL WE'VE BEEN PUTTIN DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT
Line_3827	WELL ONE CAN BE SATURATED
Line_3828	ONE GETS SATURATE AD FASTER
Line_3829	THATS COINT OF WHAT I JUST SAID
Line_3830	UM KIND OF ALREADY EXCLAIMED THAT
Line_3831	THE'RE TRYING TO SATURATE
Line_3832	BY SEEING HOW LONG IT TAKES TO SATURATE
Line_3833	KEAP SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN
Line_3834	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU NEED NO SHOW ME THE CHART AGAIN U I THINK IT'S SALT THOUG
Line_3835	CAN YOU SHOW ME THE CHAR AGAIN LIGHT
Line_3836	WELL YOU CAN A MEANS SOPORATED THE
Line_3837	ES POM SALT
Line_3838	WE'VE BEEN DOING CITRIC ASID AND CALCIUM CORD AND BAKING SO THAT WAS CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3839	THAT'S CALLED A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_3840	TWO SIE SOLID
Line_3841	THAT THOSE TWO THINGS MAKE SALT
Line_3842	WE MIXED TWO SOLUTES TOGETHER AND THEN PUT THEM IN A SOLVENT AND THEN MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3843	THOSE TWO CEMICALS MAKE WHATEVER THAT WELL THEY MIX TOGETHER AND THEN
Line_3844	IT'S  CEMICAL RE CT SHORDN
Line_3845	CAN YOU REPEATE THAT PLEASE
Line_3846	THAT ONE IS GREAITER ONES LESS AND WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER AND OR ON TWO OR POINT TWO
Line_3847	THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPENE TLET OUT GASS AND THE ONE WITH THE BAG CLOTHED CONCEELED THE GAS
Line_3848	ARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3849	THERE IS A SALAD MARBLES TRAL MIXED PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD
Line_3850	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED TOGETHER WITH ALL THREE THINGS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THE THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATE
Line_3851	THEY GET SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COULD
Line_3852	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM A MIXTURE
Line_3853	YOU'RE SEPARATING THE MARBLES FROM THE WAL
Line_3854	THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM THE WATER
Line_3855	WE MADE A SOLUTION BY USING A FILTER AND THE FILTER SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_3856	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT'S NEVERMIG
Line_3857	THE SALT SEPARATE NEVER MIND
Line_3858	THAT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT MIX MIXES INTO THE WATER AND THEY BECOME ONE JUST SALT
Line_3859	THE SALT DISAPPEARS THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE TO FORM TO FORM THE OTION
Line_3860	BECAUSE THE SALT AND THE GREAP CASTICK MIXED WITH EACH OTHER AMID A L
Line_3861	WILL YOU PLEASED REPEET IT MARNA
Line_3862	IT'S A MIXTURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN ONE THING COMING TOGE
Line_3863	THAT'S A MIXTURE UM THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_3864	THEY GARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BECAUSE UM THAT'S W
Line_3865	THE GREB SEPARATED THE WATER FROM THE MA
Line_3866	THE COFFY FILTER HELD THE SAND BUT LET GO UP THE WA
Line_3867	THE FILTER STOP THE SAND U
Line_3868	THE WOMAN AT MARNEY PLEASE H LOVE YOU BAB
Line_3869	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE REST ARE MIXE
Line_3870	THE SALT DISAPPEARED IN THE WATER AND IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_3871	IT HAS A SOLUTION OKAY BOT THE HA OH WAE DON
Line_3872	I DON'T KOW MARNEY WEL T   WHAT ADUM DI IS HE JUST KEPT SAYING  AN IT WILL DO TH WHOLE THINGS
Line_3873	THE DIFFERENTCE FROM A MIXTURE AND SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION DIR
Line_3874	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SO WHE
Line_3875	THE WATER PLUS THE SAND ECUALES SAND WATER AND THEN THE WATER PLUS THE SALT ECUALES SALT WE
Line_3876	WHAT'S A MIXTURE AND WHAT'S A SOLUTIN
Line_3877	THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS JUST IT'S A MIXTURE AND THEN THE SALT AND WATER IS A ARE SOLUTO
Line_3878	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER WHICH IS A SOLU
Line_3879	THE GRET TASTICK IS GOING TO DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER SO THE WATEL WATER IS DOSSOLVENT
Line_3880	THE SALT IS DE SOLVN SOLUTE AND THE WATER IS DISSOLVENT
Line_3881	THAT GRAM SFLOWS GRAMS EQULES GRA
Line_3882	A CANDY PUS REASONS PU PEANETS EQUALES A MIXTURE OF FIFTY GRI
Line_3883	THREE CUBS PLUS WATER EQUALS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MASS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME HEAVINESS
Line_3884	GRAMS GRAMS ITCOLES GRAMS
Line_3885	THAT WATER PUT FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER PLUCE FIFTEEN GRAMS OF SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS OF SALT
Line_3886	USING A COFFIY FILTER
Line_3887	THAT MEANS IT'S A MIXTURE MARNE
Line_3888	IT MIX ER SOLUTE
Line_3889	YOU'RE MIXING SALT AND WATER TO GET A SOLUTION
Line_3890	THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALTS DICD THE SAME AND MADE IT
Line_3891	USE A PEACHERY DISH TO SEPARATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THE SALT TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THE WATER TO SOU BAC
Line_3892	THE SALT IS LEFT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE
Line_3893	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER EVAPORATED AND THE SALT JUST STAED ON THE PEACHERY DISH BECAUSE IT'S A SOLID AND NOT A
Line_3894	WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MIXTURE OR SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN BE SEPARA
Line_3895	THE BYE
Line_3896	MIXTURE ISM SOLUTION
Line_3897	A MIXTURE IS SOMETHING WHEN YOU TAKE TO AVE THE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PUT IT TOGETHER
Line_3898	YOU'RE FILTERING THE ROCKS OUT OF THE WATER
Line_3899	SO THAT YOU COULD GET THE SOLID OUT FROM THE LIQUID
Line_3900	A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTN
Line_3901	YOU TO GET THE PEBLES OUT OF THE SAND WATER
Line_3902	BECAUSE THER A MAGNET ATTRACTS OTHER METAL THINGS TO ATTATCH TO I
Line_3903	TO SEPARATE SOLIDS FROM THE
Line_3904	YOU FILTER TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST STUCK TO THE WATER TO GET OUT WITH THE FILL
Line_3905	WE USE THE FILTER TO SEPARATE USOMETHING THAT IS VERY SMALL FROM THE WATER TO THE
Line_3906	THE LAST ONE IS THE BEST TO MAKE CRI
Line_3907	BYE BUT BYE BYE SEE YOU BY
Line_3908	MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_3909	YOU CAN GET SALT AND WATER AND THEN MIX THEM AND IT'LL ALMOST LOOK LIKE THE SALT DISAPPEARED BUT IT DIDN'T
Line_3910	IT IS DARKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3911	ONE HAS MORE THE SOLUT THAN THE
Line_3912	THERE IS MORE BOOTCH IN ONE THAN THE
Line_3913	A GRAJURATED SULINDER
Line_3914	ONE HAS MORE BSOLUTE THAN THE OTHER
Line_3915	YOU CAN TELL BY WEAIGING IT FROM UT IF ONE'S MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE
Line_3916	THAT ONE IS HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHE
Line_3917	THAT ONE HAS
Line_3918	U THIS CAN PEARE  ALFULLY HUGE
Line_3919	I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH A BAMA
Line_3920	THE WROCK HAS MORE MASS THAND THE FETHER SO IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_3921	ONE IS MORE DILUTED THAN THE OTHER
Line_3922	ONE HAS MORE OF A SOLUTION THAN THE OHE
Line_3923	IT WOULD BALANCE OUT THE SAME
Line_3924	BECAUSE ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE O
Line_3925	YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ONE EACH ONE IS DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN EACH OTHER
Line_3926	THREE AND TWO ARE THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THE MUM
Line_3927	NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRAT
Line_3928	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3929	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER THREE IS THE MOST DELUTAT
Line_3930	THAT MEANS IT FLOWTS ON TOP OF THE HEAVIER SOLUTION
Line_3931	THEY BOTH HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF SAL
Line_3932	BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS HEAVIER THAN SOLUTION
Line_3933	YOU CAN TELL BY HOW DENSE EACH ONE IS TWELVE IS TWELVE
Line_3934	THE DENSWER ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BLUE CAN HOLD UP THE GREEN AND THE
Line_3935	YOU HAVE MIXED IN A MORE GREAPE SHOY  GREAPE IT WHI F WATER
Line_3936	THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS FIVE OF THEM FIVE OF
Line_3937	WE WEITED
Line_3938	YOU WEED IT AND THE ONE WITH THE WE  MORE IS CONCUTRATERED I THINK
Line_3939	UM HOW MUCH THE SPOONSY HOW MUCH THE SPOONFULS YOU HAVE
Line_3940	THE TASTE GOOD
Line_3941	I DON'T KNOW UH OCAY
Line_3942	THE LHIS LESS
Line_3943	BETTER THAN THE RIGHT
Line_3944	AH MEABL TASE WODCAUSE THIT TIS LIKE WATER OKAY
Line_3945	IT WON'T TASTE THAT GOOD
Line_3946	YOU CAN TICK THE WATER OUT

Line_3948	THE MOONES SUN AND PLANETS
Line_3949	HALF OF THE ERTH IS IN THE DAY OR THE LIGHT AND HALF THE ERTH IS IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS TE DARK

Line_3953	IT'S MORNING IN THE EST AND NIGHT IND THE WEST
Line_3954	THE SUN AND THE ERTH AND NORTH AMERICA
Line_3955	THE ERTH IS SPINNING AROUNT THE SUN
Line_3956	THE ANIMATION SHOWES ME THAT THE ERTH IS ACTUALLY MOVING AROUNT THE SUN INSTEAD OF THE SUN MOVING AROUNT THE ERTH
Line_3957	IT'S THE SAME ANIMATION BUT IT'S MOVED IN A DIFFERENT SPOT
Line_3958	A YEAR GOES BY WHEN THE WHEN THE ERTH MOVES ALL AWAY AROUND THE SUN TO THE SAME SPOT IT WAS IN
Line_3959	IT COWERS A SYSTOM AS MEELS A CHAIR AND ENDIAN AND OTHER STUFF

Line_3983	HE'RE ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE FOR THEY GO ALL AROUND THE CCLE UNTIL THEY COME BACK TO POINT
Line_3984	IT TRE IS AL THE ANIMALS BEAT DO ALL A WAIGHT  TIL THEY GET BACK TO THE END SO THEY CAN START
Line_3985	ACTRING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN AND THAT'S A CLHOW THEY EACH OTHER AND CLECT EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER THOUG IT'S BACKED
Line_3986	THAT THEY WOULD ALL MATCH UP AND BE ABLETO EAT EACH
Line_3987	THEY  ARE LEVING ORGANISUMS
Line_3988	DOING I'M DOINK OKAY
Line_3989	WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PATTERONS AND THE CIRCULTORY SISTOM
Line_3990	WE WERE SEING IF UCE LIKED FLOWER OR SHOOGER MORE
Line_3991	I THINK THIS SHOWS LIKE UM HOW ERELIEACES GAS AS IT EAT
Line_3992	IT'S SHOWING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT ONE US EATS ONE US TO EAT
Line_3993	THAT EAST SINGLES SETTLED AND DOESN'T HAVE A MOUTH OR ANYTHING
Line_3994	WE WERE GROWING WEAT TO SEE HOW IT HOW IT IS AFFECTED BY HOW MUCH LIGHT IT HAS
Line_3995	ONE WAS NOT PUT INTO LIGHT SO I DIDN'T GET THE SAME NE DRAMS AS THE HELTHY ONE
Line_3996	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PLAN WHAT IT NEEDS TO GROW AND HOW IT GROWS
Line_3997	THE PIXTURE SHOWES IT NEEDS SOIL LIGHT AND WATER
Line_3998	I THINK THIS PLANT DOESE BECAUSE MOST PLANTS DO NEED WATER TO SERVIVE
Line_3999	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED OCXIGIEN OR SOME FORM OF AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_4000	I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THAT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME IGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_4001	ENGLISH SHOWES THAT THE PLANTS NEED SOME FORMAL FOOD OR MAYBE SOME FORMA NEW TRANTS
Line_4002	THAT THEIR D IN AWAY IS LIQUID SO IT CAN MOVE THROUGH OUT THE SELLS
Line_4003	IT SHOWS A HOME BUT PLANTS DON'T NECESARILLY NEED A HOME
Line_4004	THEY COLLECT SYGH END THEY TRANSFOR THAT AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHOGER WHICH THY PASS THROUGH THE CELLS THIS IS CALWL PLS THE CENPFHIST
Line_4005	THIS MAYBE SHOWES THAT THEY PLANT ID ANT GET ALL THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO MAKE ITS FOD SO IT DIDN'T SERVI
Line_4006	ELL THERE IS A THING IT LEAVES CALLED CLOROFILL AINT OBSERVES THE SUNLIGHT IND REFLECTS IT GREEN MEANING THIS DOEDN'T GET ANY SUNLIGHT SO YOUT CANT REFLECT OF RAIN
Line_4007	I DON'T THINK THIS PLANT HAS GOTAN ANY OCUIGIEN
Line_4008	IT DIDN'T LET IT SAY BREETH MEANING IT COULDN'T GET ANY AIR INTO IT'S LEAVES OR LET IT FLOW THROUGH OUT
Line_4009	THIS PLANT HAS EVERYTHING BIT NEEDS EXCEPT WATER WHICH HELPS
Line_4010	THE PLANT HASN'T BEGETTING ANY WATER MEANING NOT OF IT'S FOOD CAN YEU THROUG OUT IT'S BODY
Line_4011	THE PLANT HAS EVERYTHING IT AIDS IT HAS THE WATER TO HELP EVERYTHING MOVE OUT THE SUN SO IT CAN GET IT'S ENERGY AND THE OCIGIN SO IT DOESN'T DRY OUT
Line_4012	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT CAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY CAN LEAED UP TO OTHER THINGS THAT MIG NEED TO EET THESE PRODUCERS IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
Line_4013	TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS AND THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY ALSO NEED MANY TIPES OF THINGS LIKE WATER OCSIGIN AND LIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_4014	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CISTUMS
Line_4015	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CELLS AND WE DID A LEAST EXPERIMENT A FEUW IMES AGO
Line_4016	IT SHOWES DIFFERENT CELLS AND HOW THEY'RE GROUPD
Line_4017	PLANT CELLS ARE LAIGHER DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HUMAN CELLS
Line_4018	THIS ONLY SHOWES ONE SEXTION AS DOES IT WITH HUMAN
Line_4019	THAT THERE IS SHOWING A TIPE OF SELL IN A PART OF THE LEG
Line_4020	THEY ARE VEARY LONG ENOUGH TO BE GROUPED TOGETHER AND WEIF WOU DON'T HAVE A MUSIL
Line_4021	I THINK THET SHOWES MIRRORVS AND THE BRAINE
Line_4022	IT'S SHOWING ME BRAIN FELLS
Line_4023	I THINK THIS SHOWS ANOTHER PART OF AN RUM SOME SELS
Line_4024	THESE CELLS ARE IMPORTANT IS WE MAKE OF A VERY PIMPORTANT PART OF OUR BODY
Line_4025	WE'RE MADE OF MANY CELLS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT TIPES OF CELLS EVEN
Line_4026	THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS OF CELLS AND THERE'S A MNOT
Line_4027	I THINK MAYBE THE HUMAN HAS MORE SELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO MAKE UP A LARGER THING
Line_4028	IT SHOWES ABOUT OF FLAGBAGE MAYBE MADE OUT OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AS WE A
Line_4029	IT SHOWS A BUTTER FLYS DY JUST OF SIYSTOM AS WELL AS THE HUMAN
Line_4030	THEY BOTH HAVE STUMICK IN A WAY OF GETTING RID OF THEIR WAIST
Line_4031	HOWING US PERHAPS WHERE THE  DIJESTIVE SOM ART
Line_4032	IT CHOSE AND BRAKES DOWN FOS BEFORE IT HAD DUN TO THE ALPFIGIS
Line_4033	IT PUSHES DOWN FOOD INTO THE STUMEICK WITH SOME STRONG MUSLS
Line_4034	I KNOW THAT THIS IS VITAL SO THE THOD OF FOOD CAN GET INTO THE STUMICK AND SO IT CAN SO THE FOOD CAN BE BRAKED DOWN EVENR
Line_4035	THE SMALL IN TESTOMET REMOVES NEW TRAMPS WHILL THE LARGE AN TESTOMET REMOVES MOISTURE
Line_4036	THEY ARE THE LONGEST PARL THAT I JUST OF SIST
Line_4037	ERLLIYTER WE WULD TALK ABOUT THE MASCULAR SIYSTOM AND PLANT
Line_4038	IT'S PARAL IT HAS PARALLEL VAINE
Line_4039	MAKE BELIEFE IT COULD BE A MAKE BELIEAFE
Line_4040	PALMA IT HAS PALMAY VAINS
Line_4041	FLEEP HAS PENY VAINS
Line_4042	I THINK THE VAINSER FOR CARRING NI TREANS AROUND
Line_4043	I THINK THIS SHOWS A PLAN SEEM TO MAKE FILD
Line_4044	I THINK THE NEW TRAMS AN WATER AND FOOB TRAVEL THROUGH THE NAMS ON LEAVE
Line_4045	I THINK THIS IS SHOWING WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAVE
Line_4046	TIKIT TRANSPORTS FLUID AND OCIGION LIKE THE CIRCUILATORY SISTOM IN HUMANS
Line_4047	IT SHOSE WATER BEING RELIEACED FROM LEAVE
Line_4048	COVERING ALOD OF DIFFERENEN THINGS IN SCIENCE
Line_4049	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE RESPITORY SIYSTOM
Line_4050	I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE PARTS OF THE RESPATORY SIYSTOM
Line_4051	UCAN SEE THEYRE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTOM AND THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
Line_4052	THIS SHOWES HOW AIR GETS INTO THE LUNGS SOM HOW IT GETS OUT OF THE LUNGS
Line_4053	BREATHING HELPS  GIT OXGEN IN AND CARBONDISIDE OUT
Line_4054	IT COMES IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND NOWS AND IT'S FILCHERND
Line_4055	IN HALING IS BRINGING IN EX HALING IS SENDING OUT
Line_4056	THINKS THE MAIN ORGAN IS PRELONGED
Line_4057	WHEN IT MOVES IT ETHER CAUSES LOW PRESHURE HIGH PRESHURE TO GET AR IN OR OUT
Line_4058	CIGIN GETTING INTO ER BLUOD EN CARPANDIAUXSIDE GETTING OUT
Line_4059	SO WE DON'T HAVE RANDUM GASSES IN OUR BLOUD
Line_4060	AIR IS DRAGED IN THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE AND IT IS BROUGHT DOWN BY THE TRKIEA
Line_4061	THE DIRFRAM DOES ALL THE WORK BY CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING
Line_4062	NOTHING MUCH
Line_4063	BEBECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON LIVING CIYSTOMS
Line_4064	BECAUSE OF HOW ALL THE SYSTOM THE  CARE HAS WITH OTHER THINGS
Line_4065	BECAUSE HUMAN BODIES OR SISTOMS TWO
Line_4066	BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS IT HAS
Line_4067	BECAUSE OF HOW IT HAS LIKE  THE ARMS THE HEADS THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPE S A PART
Line_4068	REPLEET REPEATE THE QUESTION
Line_4069	BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND LAND
Line_4070	REPREAT THE QUESTION PLEASE
Line_4071	IT SHOWES THE WEIGHERS IN THE LITTLE HILL AND SHOWS LIKE THE STUFF UNDER WATER AND BILDINGS
Line_4072	THERE ARE SOURCE
Line_4073	BY SFIEER IS ALL ABOUT LIKE FILL ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND BIRDS THAT ARE ON LIVING ON ERTH
Line_4074	I DON'T GET THAT QUESTION
Line_4075	IT'S JUST LIKE THE FOOD CHAIN
Line_4076	BECAUSE WHEN LIKE A BEAER INTO FISH A FISH IT DOES SMALLER FISH
Line_4077	SAY THAT QUESTION AGAIN I DIDN'T HEARE YOU VERY GOOD
Line_4078	THE TWO PARTS THAT ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIXTURE
Line_4079	HOULCK AND SNAKE
Line_4080	SAY THE EXACT QUESTION YOU JUST SAID YOU ARE SPEAKING RALEB
Line_4081	IT'S ALL A CISTOM
Line_4082	BECAUSE ALL THE PICTURES THAT YEURE A SHOLING OR A SYSTOM
Line_4083	BECAUSE IT CARE IS A SYSTOM
Line_4084	BECAUSE THESE IYSTOMS ARE A SUB YSTOM OF THE SIYSTOM
Line_4085	BECAUSE THE CISTOM HAD SHOP SISTOMS
Line_4086	BECAUSE IT'S A SISTOM WITH A UNJE DOHENT YOU'RE DIFFERENT  SUB CISTOM
Line_4087	BECAUSE IT IS A SISTOM AND IT HAS LOTS OF OTHERUH LESS OF OTHER SUB CISTOMS
Line_4088	DIJESTIVE CISTIM
Line_4089	REPEET THE STICK DODN'T QUESCTITIO
Line_4090	THEY BOTH HAVE A DIJESTIVE SISTUM AND
Line_4091	THAT THE HEART IS ONE JIENT CIYSTOM
Line_4092	WELH THE CIRCULATORY CISTOMS THAT IS AN SATI YOU NEED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4093	THOSE ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE BOTDY
Line_4094	THE BPART ARE SOBLES
Line_4095	BECAUSE IT IS ONE  E CIRCUTRY SYSTOM
Line_4096	BLD  BLOD HART AND YOURE BLOD SALVS
Line_4097	IT PUMPS BLUD SO YOU CAN LIVE
Line_4098	THEY ARE IN THE BLUD I UDD  THOSE ARE BLOD THAT GOES IN YOU'R HEART AND THEN IT COMES OUT
Line_4099	UM LURNING ABOUT SISTOMS
Line_4100	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4101	IT HAS A LOT OF INDIRECTING PARTS
Line_4102	AS A SUB SISTOM AND A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4103	THEY ARE SUBCISTOMS
Line_4104	UM ALL OF ITS INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4105	BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF INTERACTING PARTS AND THERE ARE  FEW SUBCISTOMS IN THEM
Line_4106	IT IS A SUB SISTOM AND THE UNIVERSE AND IT CAN BE A SISTM OF ITS OWN I GUESS
Line_4107	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4108	THERE ARE THREE THERE IS THE ATMUSS FEER HIDROAW FEER AND THE I FORGOT THE LAUSTON
Line_4109	THEY ARE PART
Line_4110	I THINK THIS IS A FOOD WEB A FOOD WEB
Line_4111	WELL THE EVERY THING GOES TO THE BACK TERIEA AND THE FUNGITS WHEN IT DIES
Line_4112	USISTOMS
Line_4113	THEY ARE ALL PART OF A FOOD WIB
Line_4114	IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD FROM THE SUN
Line_4115	THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT ANY OTHER ORGANISMS THEY MAKE SHOOGER FROM THE SUN WATER AND OCIGON
Line_4116	THE GRASS AND THE PINE GONE
Line_4117	FROM EATING OTHER ORGANISMS
Line_4118	THE RABIT THE LISERD THE BEATELE THE BLUJEAY THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE
Line_4119	TE COMPOSING OTHER ORGANISMS AS OTHER DED ORGANISMS
Line_4120	BACGTERIA AND FUNGIE ARE D COMPOSERS
Line_4121	A YEA PRODUCER IS MISSING
Line_4122	ONE DI
Line_4123	THE MICING ORGANISM IS FUMTHD
Line_4124	A PRODUCER IS MISSING HERE
Line_4125	UMI DON'T KNOW
Line_4126	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4127	TO EAT MEAT AND TO BEAT PLANTS
Line_4128	CARNIEVORS ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_4129	OMNIVBOARS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_4130	A BEAR IS  UMNIVOR
Line_4131	TO EAT ONLY DED ORGANISMS
Line_4132	THEY ONLY EAT DED ORGANISMS AND YEAH
Line_4133	D COMPOSRS
Line_4134	IT MOST IS  E PURBLOR
Line_4135	THE FOX IS  UM THE FOX IS  ON THEVOOR
Line_4136	THIS IS A D COMPOSER
Line_4137	A RED WARM IS A D COMPOSER YEAH
Line_4138	CLIBACICLY CLEEN UP
Line_4139	EI'RE DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4140	IT'S WATER AND IT GROWES
Line_4141	THE EASE IS ORGANISM AND THE EASE IS KIND OF A D COMPOSER AND IT BREAKES DOWN THE COOKE
Line_4142	THE US NEEDS THE WATER TO BREAKE DOWN THE COOKE FOR OBSORBTION
Line_4143	THEY ARE D COMPOSIERS AND THEY'RE USED ON BRED
Line_4144	WE WERE GROWING LEAT
Line_4145	HAS SOME LIGHT THE OTHER DOESN'T HAVE SOME LIGHT
Line_4146	THE ROUTS OF THE PLANT AND WWATERING THE PLANT
Line_4147	WATER SUNLIGHT AND SOIEL
Line_4148	DOES NEED WATER BUT IT NEEDS IT ALSO NEAEDS OCRIGN INT NEAEDS SUNLIGHT AND IT NEADS MNEUTRIGANTS
Line_4149	THIS IS AIR PLANTS DO NEED AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_4150	SOME MLIGHT AND NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SIERVIVE
Line_4151	NE TRANTS PLANTS DO NEED NE TRANS TO SERVIVE
Line_4152	LIZER PLANTS DON'T NEED FIRTALIZER BUT IT HELPS THE PLANTS
Line_4153	HOUSE IT'S ABOUT IT
Line_4154	UM YEA
Line_4155	UM IT SHOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE OF THE MATERIALS WOULD GET RID OF
Line_4156	LUT
Line_4157	THERE IS NO AIR SO IT WOULD DIVE
Line_4158	KILLED IT ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4159	NO WATER IT'S NOT AS BAD AS NO AIR BUT STEELL ALMOST KILLED IT
Line_4160	THEY BOTH KILL THE PLANS
Line_4161	HE'S ALL THREE NEW DREEAMS WITCH MAKES IT OSOME AND YEAH
Line_4162	BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE NE DRAMS
Line_4163	THERE ARE THE STARD  THE FOODWIB IF THERE WASN'T PRODUCERS THEN THE FOOBLEB WOULDN'T WORK
Line_4164	FOOD WEPBS AND SISTOMS AND LEAVES
Line_4165	IT'S ESIT'S EST
Line_4166	THAT EAST IS ALIVE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS A SEL AR SALS IS ALIVE
Line_4167	IT'S DIFFERENT TIPES OF SCELLS
Line_4168	I SEE SCELLS UF LEAFE AND IT LOOKS SCOAL
Line_4169	I SEEN MUSL SELLS
Line_4170	THAT THEY'RE MUSSLE AND THEYRE SELLS
Line_4171	IT SHOWES ME THE BRAIN SELLS
Line_4172	I SEE REGULAR SCELLS
Line_4173	SKIN CELES CAN DROP DRIE AND DIE
Line_4174	SCAND NE BLUD ORGANS
Line_4175	INDS HAVE MILLIANS AND BILLIANS AND TRILLIANTS D CELLS AND EAST ONLY HAS ONE
Line_4176	THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
Line_4177	I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4178	IT'S THE DIJESTIVE SISTOM  FOR HUMANS AND FOR BUTTERFLIES
Line_4179	WE BOTH HAVE SISTOMS
Line_4180	IT'S SHOWING S THE DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_4181	IAREY TOLD YOU IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMICK
Line_4182	THE IN TESTIANTS OBSORBED THE WATER AND INEW STREANS
Line_4183	SHURE DIJESTIVE SISTOM SELS THOSE IN THE MAIN POINTS
Line_4184	I AM DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
Line_4185	IT IS A LEAFE AND VANES
Line_4186	IT'S  PARALLEL
Line_4187	IT'S THE HAND  MY LEAVE SO 'S THAT BUGG IN ME H KITTING IT'S A HAND POLLEMAY LEAVE
Line_4188	NEO IDEAH NAYIEA CHAINGE SAWA LEAF
Line_4189	THE EDGES LOOK LIKE A CHANE SA AND THE VANS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A FETHER SO MAYBE IT'S A FETHER CHAN SA
Line_4190	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SIYSTOM
Line_4191	UM I DON'T KNOW UM IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCULARTORY SISTOM
Line_4192	A UM IT SHOWES WATER
Line_4193	UM NOT VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4194	IRCULATORY SISTOM YEAH YEAH CIRCULATORY SISTOM FOR THE WE
Line_4195	THE GUILATORY SISTOM FOR THE WIND I TOLD YOU
Line_4196	A HUMAN RESPTORY SISTOM IS AIR SISTOM FOR THE WIND
Line_4197	UH O CHI COMES TO THE BODY AND SEE OH TWO COMES OUT OF THE BODY
Line_4198	LUNS
Line_4199	UH THEY'RE IMPORTANT
Line_4200	IT GIVES AXIOND INTO AE BLUOD STREEN AND IT TAKES OFF SIEO TWO
Line_4201	IT'S IN FORM PARTAN FOR YOUR BLD
Line_4202	
Line_4203	FROM A AND B NO IT WAS A NOT AH
Line_4204	THE UM SOLFICGIS
Line_4205	UM I'M DOING OCA UHM HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_4206	I SERIESLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN SCIENCE
Line_4207	IT'S THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_4208	IT HAS A CIGTOR SISTM IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE ARB AND IT COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE VANGE AND THE HEART PUMPS THE BLOOD
Line_4209	E H TO OR CARBON DI OCXKX SIDE
Line_4210	IT'S BLOD AND THE BLUE PART ARE THE SELLS AND THE BLOUE THINGS THAT ARE MOVING OR CARBON BY ACT SIDE
Line_4211	BANS AND ARTERE
Line_4212	I DRON'T UM CAN IS UM REPETETHE
Line_4213	HAT IT PUMPS BLUOD
Line_4214	I AM  BLUD COMING IN AND OUT AND A BEING GROWS KIND OF
Line_4215	E HOLED BLOUOD
Line_4216	THEY CARRY BLUD THEY CARRY BLUD
Line_4217	IT'S THE HEART IT PUMPS BLUD
Line_4218	SE CARIYES THE BLUD TO THE SELLS
Line_4219	BLOUOD TO THE SELL CARY BLOUD TO THE SELLS
Line_4220	IT IS THE RESPRITORY SISTOM
Line_4221	IT'S BREETHING TO GET OCRIGON TO THE BLUD TO CARY TO THE SELLS
Line_4222	IT'S BREATHING
Line_4223	IT TAKES OCTRAGEN TO THE BLUD TO
Line_4224	ODA UM IT'S IT'S THE MAIN ORGAN AND WHISTPEROTORY SA
Line_4225	THERE ARE TWOBS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE SHAKE AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS
Line_4226	UN I DON'T KNOW
Line_4227	THE TRIK YEAH IT'S SE STOP BASCKME FOURS
Line_4228	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_4229	THEY ALL LIVE ON ERTH THEY ALL ARE THINGS
Line_4230	IT IS TIPE T IT'S A TIPE OF A CHAINE
Line_4231	THERE ARE SUBCYSTOMS IN THE COLOR
Line_4232	THERE IS THINGS THAT ARE LITTLETHAT ARE PARTS THAT GO IN THE SIYSTOM SO THAT WOULD BE CALLED A SUBSIYSTOM
Line_4233	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBE SIYSTOMS IN SIDE OF IT
Line_4234	YOU CAN SEE PARTS OF THE BODY
Line_4235	THE SHAPE OF THE HEART
Line_4236	THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE HUMAN BODY
Line_4237	THE'RE INTERACTING PARTS AND
Line_4238	U ERTH WHICH IS A SYSTOM
Line_4239	I THINK THE BIOS FEER
Line_4240	EVEY THING THET BIO SFPIER IS MADE OF WATER AND ANEMALS
Line_4241	BECAUSE THE BIL SFIR IS IN THOSE PLACES
Line_4242	THE BORIAL FORIST AND THE WET LANDS
Line_4243	ALL OF THE FOODWEBS HAVE A HUMAN BEING IN IT
Line_4244	THAT EVERYTHING COMES FROM THE FONGIE AND THE BACTERIEA
Line_4245	IT'S AN ORGANISM GETTING WHAT IT NEEDS
Line_4246	THEY'RE ADDING IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Line_4247	IT IS BACKTERIEA
Line_4248	NOTHING WELL I DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_4249	WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BLOVING ORGANISMS AND LIVING THINGS DORGANISMS
Line_4250	ONE OF THEM HAS HAD MORE WATER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4251	GRIPTHIYEN
Line_4252	THE PLANT IS GETTING WATER AND IT IS GROWLING
Line_4253	WATER AND SUNLIGHT
Line_4254	PLANTS DO NEED WATER JUST ARIVE BECAUSE HAT'S PRITY MUCH LIKE HUMANS FIELD FOR THEM THEY CAN LIVE WITH OUT IT NEITHER CAN HUMANS
Line_4255	PLANTS TRIN NEED WATER TO LIVE AND TGROW
Line_4256	IT IS SHOWING A PICTURE OF AY PLANT AND A WATER DRUM
Line_4257	AIR YOU CANT SEE BUT YOU CAN FEEL
Line_4258	YES I THINK THEY NEED IT MOST OF THE TIME
Line_4259	THE SUN IS SHINING DOWN ON THE OF THE PLANT
Line_4260	SOMELIGHT TALXD
Line_4261	YES T LIVE
Line_4262	YES DEFINEATELY
Line_4263	UM THIS IS A BRGER
Line_4264	YES YES
Line_4265	ANTING SUD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HE SLAOR ELSE THE WRILD OODT WORK LIKE IT IS
Line_4266	IT WOULD BE A PROBLUM BECAUSE LIKE PEOPLE PLANTS NEAED FOOD TO SERVIVE
Line_4267	UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAIN IT COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IT SHOWS
Line_4268	NO
Line_4269	WELL NO BECAUSE FIRTALIZER CAN KILL THEM WHICH I REALLY DOIDN'T THINK ABOUT
Line_4270	IT'S A HOUSE
Line_4271	NO PHLAMS DO NOT ON EACH SHELTERTWO CIRVA
Line_4272	GREAG HOW ARE YOU
Line_4273	WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT'S IN YOUR BODDY
Line_4274	WE'VE BEEN TALKING AOT THE HUMAN BODDY AND
Line_4275	THEY BOTH HAVE SIMILAR BLUD SELLS I MEAN SELLS NOT BLOD SELLS SELLES
Line_4276	UM IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4277	I SEE BLUE SELLS THEN I SEE BLUE KIND OF SHORT SQUIGLY LINES
Line_4278	THEY'RE ALL KIND OF TOGETHER THEY NEVER FLOW APPART FROM EACH OTHER THAT KIND OFS LIKE A PAIR
Line_4279	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_4280	UH I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
Line_4281	THE PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY WHICH THERE ARE VERY VERY MANY OF THEM UM
Line_4282	THE ASOLIG AS TRANSFERS THE BROKEN UP PIECES OF FOOD DOWN TO THE STOUMMICK
Line_4283	THE SOFFICAS PLACE A BIG ROLE IND THE DYJESTISTM TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FOOD GETS DOWN TO THE M STUMMICK
Line_4284	TO TAKE THE FOOD AND BRINK IT UP INTO PIECES AND TO MAKE SURE TRANSVERSE TO THE SMALL INESTIMET
Line_4285	OH THAT IT PUTS IT INTO ALL THE WAIST IT PUTS IT IN THE WAIST AND THEN COMES OUT
Line_4286	WHEN THE COOKIY GETS WET IT TURNS INTO OSE
Line_4287	MAYBE BECAUSE THE'RE A A TIPE OF PLANT
Line_4288	GRS AND IT'S IT IT'S GRASS AND IT'S TIP ROP IT'S A TIPER PLAN
Line_4289	ON THE LEFT THE GRASS IS A LITTLE MORE DECAYE
Line_4290	BECAUSE THEY'ARE THE SAME TIPE OF PLANT BUT ONE OF THEM IS MORE DICATE THAN THE OTHER
Line_4291	ONE OFWUM HAS PROBABLY NOT GOT IN AS MUCH WATE
Line_4292	THE PLANTS ALSO HAVE BAIRUBBLE NEEDS LIKE UM OF WATER AND AND
Line_4293	THEY SORMEAT AND WATER
Line_4294	YES THEY NEED WATER TO SERVIVE AND BECAUSE UM AND WHENEVER SOMETHING IS D HIDRATED IT WILL IT WILL DIE
Line_4295	I I THINK THEY DO NEED WATER BECAUSE UM IT OH PRETY MUCH EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS WATER SOCHOSE TO SERVIVE WITHOUT IT WE'D ALL D HIDRAT AND DIVE
Line_4296	ALL LEVING THINGS NEED AIR TO BREATH
Line_4297	YES UM EVERY LIVING THING NEEDS AIR TO SERVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T BREETH AND THEY JUST DOP
Line_4298	I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK PRNTS DO NEED AIR BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE AIR THEY'D ALL JUST THEY WOULN'T BE ABLE TO BREETH AND THEY'D JUST DIE
Line_4299	M PLANTS NEEDS OMMAGTES THOR SERVIVE BECAUSE OTHERWISE UM THEY'D BE TOO COLD AND THEY AND THEN THEY TA THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_4300	WU YES CLISE THEN THEYW'LD UM GET TO COLD AND DIE
Line_4301	I SEE A PICTURE OF A HAMBERGAR AND A PLANT
Line_4302	YES IT WOULD DIE OF HUNGER AND UM AND THERE WOULD BE NO P
Line_4303	WILH THAT UM  CERNTO HAVE A FLD UM IT PRANCE WILL DIE
Line_4304	IT YES IF PLANCE DON'T GET FOOD THEY JUST DU
Line_4305	U SOME KIND OF CAN AND WITH A PIXTURE OF AN APPLE AN
Line_4306	YES UM BECAUSE IT'S A TEPC SO SOIL AND GRAMPS NEED TO BE PUT IN SOIL JUST ARVIVE
Line_4307	IT'S NOT NEEDED BUT IT'S A HELP A HELPFUL THINGS FOR PLANTS
Line_4308	UM IT'S A HOUSE WHICH COULD BE A TIPE OF SHELTER FOR A PLANT
Line_4309	PANECITYE FILTER WHEN IT'S LIKE COLD DURING LIKE THE WINTER AND OTHER TIME
Line_4310	I S I THINK THEY DO NEED UM SHELTER T  TO SERVIVE CLATROTHERWISE UM DURING THE WINTER THE JUST FREESE UP IND DIVE
Line_4311	IT SHOWES THAT UM PLANTY NEED TO SEMMATE WATER AND THEN UM WAITS WATER CAN EVAPORATE FROM ITUM
Line_4312	BECAUSE IT'S  THERE MEAN UM SOR UM NEEDS FOR SERVIVEAL AND TWITHOUT IT THEY DUM JUST STOP
Line_4313	THE GIRL AN IT A UM FEET ON Y ENERGY
Line_4314	THEY DO MIK TE FOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
Line_4315	IT HAS WATER AND AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUNMAGHT
Line_4316	IT DOESN'T IT DIDN'T GET AND U IT DOESN'T GET ENUPH SUNG
Line_4317	UM BUT IT WON'T GET ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT ENERGY
Line_4318	UM IT LOOKS MORE MUCH MORE DECAE AND UM YEAH AND ORANGECH AND UM SICKALLY BECAUSE IT HAS SUNLIGHT AND WATER BUT NO AIR
Line_4319	IT GETS ENOUGH WATER AND SOME AGT BUT NOT ENOUGH AIR
Line_4320	IT MAKES IT DECAY EVEN MORE THAN IT DOES WITHOUT SUNIGHT
Line_4321	M IT LOKS SICKALLY TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GETTING ANY WATER
Line_4322	IT HAS NOT BENGINNING TO GET IN ANY WATER BUT IT'S BEEN GETTING AIR AND SUNIGHT
Line_4323	UM WITH OUT WATER AILDIT WILL M DOT
Line_4324	IT THOUH IT DOES NOT LOOK SICKALLY IT LOOKS REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER SUNLIGHT AND AIR
Line_4325	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MUCH OR TO LITTLE OF WATER SUMAT OR AIR
Line_4326	UM THIS ONE HAS ENOUGF WATER AIR AND SONTHA
Line_4327	THE PLAN IS STICYING HELTHY
Line_4328	THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FEED ON EACH OTHER AND THERE ARE D COMPOSERS PRODUCERS AND CONSUMER
Line_4329	UH I HAVE NO IDEEA
Line_4330	THEY'REA PART OF THELITOR OF FLUEDWEYB
Line_4331	UM WITH THE BOUT PRODUCERS UM THE FLIDDWEMS WOULD JUST START FALLING UPON
Line_4332	THE STIR WITH THREEM COMPOSRS THEN PRODUCERS THEN THEY END WITH CONSUMERS
Line_4333	THE MAN'S NEED UM FOOD AND WATER AND AIR BUT NOT SHELTER OR FIRTALIZED
Line_4334	UM THE HUMAN AND THE EST ARE BOTH MADE OF SOS THEY ARE DIFFERENT TIPS OR SELLS BUT THE'E STILL SO
Line_4335	UM PLANTS ARE NOT SINGLE COLED ORGANISMS THEY HAVE MORE THEN ONES SO

Line_4337	THERE ARE BRAINS SOS AND WHICH ARE UM DIFFERENT
Line_4338	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT IT'S THAT THESE AT THESE ARE BRAINS SO
Line_4339	I SEE SKIN CSILLS WHICH ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM BRAIN CILS AND MUSL S

Line_4353	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4354	THE INTERACTING SUB SISTOMS THAT MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_4355	AS INTERACTING PARTS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE HUMAN BODY WORK
Line_4356	IT HAS LOTS OF SUB SIYSTOMS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE IFF WORK CORRECTLY
Line_4357	THEY INTERACT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ERTH LIKE
Line_4358	I SEE THE HIDROLIC SYSTOM
Line_4359	THERE IS THE EGOEGO CISTOM
Line_4360	THE BIRO SPEAR IS LIVING THING
Line_4361	BY OU SPEAR IS ALL THE WATER AND THE WORLD

Line_4367	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIGFE CICLES PRODUCERS CONSUMARS AND D COMPOSERS ARE ALL PART OF THE LIGHFE CICLES
Line_4368	IT MAKES HIS UM FOID BYES FOTO SIMPT
Line_4369	THEY DO NOT EAT OTHER ORGANS
Line_4370	THE BACHERO FONGY PINE TREE AND GRAS

Line_4393	IT SHOWES A CAN WITH THE TMETO ON
Line_4394	THERE IS A HOUSE AND PANTS HOW NICSE
Line_4395	IT SHOWES HOW IMPORTENT SIMFACICE WORKS AND AND WHAT FO A SIMFHAICE NEEDS TO WOR
Line_4396	SO THEY COULD GET FILL FROM BOTTALES AND BY SAID
Line_4397	IT CRIPPLED IT AND IT'S DYING
Line_4398	THE PLANT NEEDS ALL THREE THINGS TO SERVIVE AND MAKE IT'S OWN ENERGY
Line_4399	IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS IT NEEDS FOR TO CHEVARVE SO ITIS GROWING QUITE NICELY
Line_4400	IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO SERVIVE
Line_4401	VENTUALLY THE ENERGY FROM THE PLANS COMES UP TO HOCKS IGLES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_4402	HALLOW HALLOW AND GOOD BI
Line_4403	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CISTOMS AND SUB CISTOMS
Line_4404	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AND DIRECTING PARTS
Line_4405	IT HAS DIFFERENT INTERRACTING PARTS
Line_4406	IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THEY MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS  HOW DIFFERENT THING
Line_4407	IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS THAT HELPS IT WORK AND IF IF ANY OF THE INTERACTING PARTS WEREN'T THERE IT WOULDN'T
Line_4408	ALL OF THE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_4409	ECAUSE IT HAS MANY PARTS THAT MAKES THE BODDY WORK
Line_4410	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INTRACTING PARTS
Line_4411	IT HAS MANY INTERACTING PARTS AND SULF CISTOMS LIKE ANIVBLS AND HUMANS IND PLANTS
Line_4412	TALKING ABOUT CIYSTOM AND IT'S ALSO
Line_4413	ABOUT CISITUMS AND SLIP STU
Line_4414	BECAUSE THEY HAVE MANY ATRACTING PART
Line_4415	IT HAS INTERECTING PARTS THAT MAKES IT BE OVER THE MIDL END THE CONTRACTING PARTS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S MAKING IT WORK
Line_4416	IT HAS MEANY DISANT INTORRECTING PARTS THAT CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO THE WHOLE BODYES
Line_4417	WELL WITH OUT ANY OF THESE HETHE WHOLE SYSTOME MOTIVE WORK
Line_4418	BECAUSE IT HAS MANY ANTRACTING PARTS AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE ADTRACTING PARTS IT WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE CISTI
Line_4419	UM INDI
Line_4420	I DOEARE S ABOUT PLANTS UNIN FISHES AND WATERS
Line_4421	THEY SHOW WHAT ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER AND WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS IN THE ECOS
Line_4422	IT'S DOING GOOD I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU
Line_4423	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THE CIRFISE
Line_4424	WE PUT WAX PAPER ON THE BLUE CIRFICE
Line_4425	WATER SLIDES DOWN A SLOAP
Line_4426	YOU CAN ADD MORE WATER TO ONE DROP AND LESS WATER TO ANOTHER DROP AND THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS
Line_4427	THE WATER IS FLOWING DOWN THIS SLOWP
Line_4428	WE DID NOT USE THE WROCK OR THE PAPER CLIP BUT I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BOTH SUNK
Line_4429	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_4430	KIND OF BLENDED WITH THE OTHER WATER BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOT IT STIRED OR MIXED BY ACCIDENT
Line_4431	COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN ROUM TEMPERATURE WATER SO IT EITHER STICKES IN THE VILE OR SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
Line_4432	WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING WITH ICE AND WATER
Line_4433	THEY WOULD BE LIQUIDS
Line_4434	WHEN WATER COOLES IT GETS DENSER
Line_4435	UM DENCITY IS MAKING THE WATER LEVEL DROP BELOW RUM TEMPERATURE
Line_4436	ICE IS ACTUALLY LESS DENSE THAN WATER BECAUSE IT FLOWTS
Line_4437	THAT TELLS ME THAT WHEN WTHAT THE COLD WATER IS DENSER THAN REGULAR WATER
Line_4438	PWOE WATER CREATES LESS DENCITY SO THAT'S SPACICALLY WHAT IT DOES
Line_4439	WHEN YOU PUT WATER IN TA FREESER IT TAKES MORE SPACE AND IT BECOMES A SOLID
Line_4440	IT GETS LESS DENSE CAUSING THE WATER TO RISE
Line_4441	WATER TAKES UP MORE SPACE AS IT IS HEAETED
Line_4442	IT MEANS TO  SOLITIFIE I THINK
Line_4443	E WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EVAPORATING OVER TIME
Line_4444	IT TURNS OUT MY MY CRIFONE WAS NOT IN THE PROPER POSITION SO THAT'S WHIY YOU COULDN'T JEAR ME BUT I COULD HEAR YOU
Line_4445	THE UNCOVERED WEP PAPER TOWELE
Line_4446	HAS MORE WATER IN IT BECAUSE THE CUP ON T RIGHT HAS COMPLETLY EVAPORATED
Line_4447	THE WEIGH PAPER TOWLS DED WHEAT BECAUSE TE PLASTIC LID IS SEELLING IN THE HUMINITY
Line_4448	WE HAVE BEIN
Line_4449	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EXPOSED TO HEAT WHICH CAUSED EVAPORATION
Line_4450	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS TOUCHING THE AIR CAUSING IT TO BE AIBLE TO EVAPORATE
Line_4451	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EVAPORATING
Line_4452	WHEN WATER VAPER IT TOUCHES A COLD CUP IT FORMS CONTENSATION WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST
Line_4453	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS REALLY COLD
Line_4454	I THINK THE DROP ARE THE WATER ON THE LID AR WATER DROP LITS SO THAT BASICALLY IS
Line_4455	THE WATER DROP LITS FORMED INSIDE THE CONCENSATION CHAMBER SO IT BASICALLY IS
Line_4456	WE OBSERVED THAT THE CONDENSATION WAS IN THE INSIDE WITH OWER ACTUAL CONDENSATION CHAMBERS
Line_4457	THE OARTER HAS TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE CUP BUT WITH LID IT DIFIES EVAPORATION
Line_4458	IT IS REALLY COAL BECAUSE IT JUST AMASES ME
Line_4459	WE HAVE BEN EXPERIMENTING WITH SOIL AND GRAVEL
Line_4460	I SEE A PILE OF SOIL AND A PILE OF GRAVEL
Line_4461	I KNOW THAT WATER CAN FLOW SEE SOIL AND WATER CAN FLOW THROUGH GRAVEL
Line_4462	BY WHAT DE MASO WELL THEY ACT R THEY ACT DIFFERENTLY WITH EACH OTHER
Line_4463	WATER CAN SPIN A WATER WE ALL TO MAKE U
Line_4464	FIVE OF THE RED THINGS THREE OF THE
Line_4465	IT IS  WAT A MELL WHACH HELPS POWER THE HOUSE AND YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THIS QUESTION
Line_4466	DI C SPACICALLY WHAT WE DID AND IT
Line_4467	UM FORCE ANOTHER BLAIDE IS RIGHT THERE SO THAT KEEPS IT SPINNING AS LONG AS THERE IS A FLOW OF WATER
Line_4468	BY MARNEY I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU
Line_4469	I'M DOING GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4470	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND UM IT'S PROPERTIES
Line_4471	THO WATER IS MAKING BEAEDS ON THE ALUMINIUM FOL
Line_4472	THE PAPER TALL HAS OBSORVED THE WATER
Line_4473	THE PAPER TAL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER LEAVING A TINIY MARK
Line_4474	THE SMALLER DROP LITS CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A BIGGER DROP LIT
Line_4475	WAT ARE ON DIFFERENT CIRFICES CAN
Line_4476	THE WATER OR THE PAPER PAL HAS OBSORBED THE WATER
Line_4477	THE SOLPY WATER DECREASES TO IR TENTION WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIRFACE ATENTION
Line_4478	THE CAUSING THE WATER TO NOYT RISES HIGTE WHEN THE SALT WATER DOES NOT AFFECT THE SIRFICE TENSION
Line_4479	YES DROP LITS OF WATER ARE COMING OUT
Line_4480	WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH WATER
Line_4481	CIRFICE PENTION IS HAPPINING
Line_4482	CIRFICE TENTION IS THE PROPERTY THAT KEEPS WATER TOGETHER AND NOT IN A THIN LINE
Line_4483	SALT WATER HAS NO EFFECT AND IT ACTS LIKE PLAIN WATER
Line_4484	THE DOLM NAD TO BULT S HIE
Line_4485	MARNEY I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4486	UM THE BULB STARTED AT THE SIDE OF THE DESC AND WE DROPED IT AND IT WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4487	BECAUSE ALL EVERYONE
Line_4488	I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE TO DAY
Line_4489	THE BUB AND THE UM
Line_4490	HOW MANY NUMBERS OF OF SWINGS THERE ARE
Line_4491	AND UM PUT EITHER ONE OF EM ON THE STICK AND THEN YOU'R GOING TO SEE HOW FAR IT GOS
Line_4492	YOU PUT THEM IN BETWEEN TWO OTHER STICKS THAT ARE GLOD OUN TO THE FLIPPER BACE OR THE THE FLIPPER STICK
Line_4493	IT HELPS IT UM
Line_4494	WELL I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A BULLB SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4495	I UH I DON'T KNOW WHITCH TALKING ABOUT DOSNT MAKE REALLY MUCH SENTSE
Line_4496	UM FILLIN FOUSTING SO
Line_4497	THE RASION RELATION SHIP BETWEENIT
Line_4498	LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT'S GOING TO DO WHEN TEN SECANDT S AND YEAH
Line_4499	S THE PENJULUM LANK
Line_4500	UM IT'S TELLING YOU HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWIT LIKE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THE PENDULUM IS DOING
Line_4501	MAKING AN ESTIMAT OF WHAT YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
Line_4502	IT WOULN'T IT WHEN'T IT WOULD STINK FASTER THAN IT WOULD IF YOU HAD  CUP THAT'S UM A LI A BIT LONGER
Line_4503	MAY NOT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS IT COULD HOLD I GUESS
Line_4504	UM Y CAPACITY GOES UP YOU WHOL IT WHOLDS LIKE MORE PACANGERS
Line_4505	OLA OH THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS THE MORE YOU'RE DOING THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE IT'S GON NOT GO
Line_4506	I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Line_4507	YOU WOULD PROBABLY COUNT LIKE BY TEN ER FIVE MAYBE
Line_4508	THE S OH THE EX AXIS TELLS I HOW MANY RUBR BANDS LIGHT THERE ARE
Line_4509	THE MORE RIVER BANDS THEIRE ARE THE FIRTHER IT'S GOING IT'S GOING TO GO
Line_4510	IT'S GOING UP
Line_4511	THAT IT'S GOING DOWN INSTEAD OF GOING UP
Line_4512	UM THEY'RE ABOUT UM LIKE HOW THING LIKE HOW THEY MOVE LIKE HOW THEY KEEP ON SPINNING
Line_4513	IT'S A PENDULM AND THE PENY IS WHAT KEEPS IT SPINNING
Line_4514	IT KEEPS ON SPINNING AT THE SAME LEVEL
Line_4515	UM ONE WILL SWING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN SLOW DOWN TWO WILL GO LONGER AND THEN SO ON SO
Line_4516	UH THE THIRTY EIT ONE IT WILL SWING FIR
Line_4517	ITLL SWING EITE SWINGS FOR IN FIFTEEN SECUONDS
Line_4518	SO THE SHORTER ONE UM SWUNG LONGER AND THE THIRTY EIGT CENTIMETER
Line_4519	UM THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY SWING THE LEAST AMOUNT
Line_4520	UM TO DAY WE STARTED UM MAKING UM CATTPLETS
Line_4521	UM IT'S IT'S GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING
Line_4522	UM THE THE PAPER CLIP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU C COULDN'T A FLIP ANYTHING WITH IT
Line_4523	UMH ON THIS THERE IS UM OH JUST A PLAIN CORK LIKE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE RUBER CORK
Line_4524	UH YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE FLIP STICK ABOUT UM
Line_4525	M TWENTY SEVEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4526	UM M WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING PEY PENDULMS AND WE STARTED DOING PUM GRAMS ABOUT THEM TO DAY
Line_4527	UM I YOU IT WOULDN'T BE A CONTROLE VARIABLE
Line_4528	UM WELL THIS ONE IS ABOUT UM HOW LONG THE STRING IS AND HOW MANY UM SWINGS IT DID
Line_4529	THE SHORTEST LENGTH OF STRING IS SWINGIN THE MOSTAND THEN THE LONGEST STRING IS SWINGING THE LEAST
Line_4530	COULD YOU YOU USE UM A GRAF AND YEAH
Line_4531	UEN THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS
Line_4532	UM WE STARTED TODAY LEARNING ABOUT LIKE ABOUT BOTS AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4533	WELL WE FIRST PUT THE BOT IN WITH NO NO PENIYES IN IT
Line_4534	UM MAYBE OU MAKING THE BOT HIGHERR OR LONGER TO FIT MORE PEOPLE IN
Line_4535	THE BOT WOULD HIT THE BOTTOME AND LIKE JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP WITHOUT GETTING WATER IN IT
Line_4536	UM YOU CAUNDON'T IT'S  CONTROLING A GOOD VARIABULE IS WHEN OU UM ONLY SWITCH ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4537	UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOTS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD
Line_4538	UM THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE PENIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4539	UM IT IS TELLING YOU THE NUMBER OF THE CUP AND HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_4540	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND U FLYING THEM ON FISHING WIRE
Line_4541	UM YOU ONT NO
Line_4542	HE INDYPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4543	UH A NUMBER OF WINDS
Line_4544	UM SO THE THE ONES WITH OUT THE PAPER CLIPS GOIS THE FARTHEST AND THE ONES WITH THE MOST PAPER GLIP CLIPS GOS THE LEAST
Line_4545	UM THAT IF YOU DID CHANGE THEM IT WOULD AFFECT HOW IT FLIS
Line_4546	UM I WANTED TO FIGER OUT IF IF YOU HAD MORE ON UM HOW WOULD IT AFFECT HOW IT FLOWS
Line_4547	BCAUSE IF YOU CHANGED ALL OF THE ALL THE VER MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4548	HOW FAR THE DIST I MEAN JUST THE DISTANCE
Line_4549	UH THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS
Line_4550	UM WE WERE TRYING TO FIGER OUT IF THE DISTANCE GOES UP WHEN WE ADD PASANGERS OR IF IT GOES DOWN HEN WE ADD PASANGERS
Line_4551	UM WEL YOU HAVE TO YOU SHOULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME OR ELSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT
Line_4552	UM YOULD GET MORE ACCURAT  ANSWERS AND THINGS
Line_4553	UM THE MORTOR WHICH IS THE RATHERD VANCE AND THE DISTANCE
Line_4554	UM UM THE WY AXIS UM IT SHOWS THE THE DICERNCE THO PLAN FLEW
Line_4555	I DON'T KNOW WHAT A INDIPENNANT OR UH INDIPENDENT VERIBLE IS
Line_4556	M I KNOTICE THAT UM INDIPENDENT VERIBLE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BEFORE AND THE INDPENDENT VERIBLES IS WHAT WE LEARNED
Line_4557	U WILL FIND THAT DEPENDENT VERIBLE ON THE WY AXIS
Line_4558	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAST PA YOU SAID
Line_4559	UM THIS POINT S UM CEPT STICKYING THE SAME SO WIT THAT MAKES IT A STRAT LINE
Line_4560	UM WE'VE BEEN DOING UM THE FILIPPAR BACE AND UM WE DID THE GRAM SOD THA
Line_4561	UM THIS SPACE IT STICK IT IN SO THAT YOU CAULD BALANCE THE QUICK
Line_4562	UM IT UM GROS THE ONE SCEUM AND THE TWO SEUM AND THREE SCEUM
Line_4563	UM YOUA HAVETO MAKE SURE THAT'S UM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THEAT THE OPPOSIT WAY LIGKES FROM
Line_4564	UM I NOTICE STERS WHERE BY CORT U CORTC A WOODENMBULE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THEM ARE
Line_4565	I SEE THAT THE PLASTIC BULP IS SPOUNTING ON THE WALL AND IT BOUNTS BACK
Line_4566	I THINK YOU ARE READY SHOW ME THIS PICTURE
Line_4567	IT HAS TO HIG THE HEIGHT SO THAT CAN HELP IT LIKE GO UM GO FARTHER
Line_4568	UM PADIODIUM LENCE AND NUMBER OF SWAIGNS
Line_4569	UM I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE UM THE LENTH AND THE SCREEN
Line_4570	IT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF STRAIN U EITHER LOWNG LARGER OR SMALLER
Line_4571	IVE JUST BEEN DOING THE SWINGS THAT U YOU PULT ONE STRAIN DOWN AND MAKE SOMETHING SWINGS
Line_4572	IT'S IT GRA AND WIEBAR
Line_4573	THE NUMBER OF STRANGE SWITCHES FROM TEN TO TO HUNDRED
Line_4574	ABOUT THE HIGHT AND WHICH IS  THE CAPHAS CAPACITY
Line_4575	I DON'T GET IT I CAN LIKE THE PANIS
Line_4576	UM I TRAIED TO CLICK BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
Line_4577	I KNOW THAT UM D IS WILL BE BIGGER AND
Line_4578	AND A WILL BE SMALLER BUT THAT UM THOUH THEY'E LIKE ALL THE SAME HIGHT IS THREE CENTIMETERS
Line_4579	YOU SHE ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIBLE AT THIT'S TIME TWO SEET IT'S DIFFERENT NOT CHANGED LIKE THREE OR FORE VARIBLES AND YOU DON'T KOW WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT
Line_4580	I THINK YOU ARE A SHOWMING THIS UM PICTURE
Line_4581	OF CORSE IF THE WATER IS MOVING I THINK THE PENY WILL TIPED OR THE WATER WILL GO IN
Line_4582	TO DAY MEAN AND MY PARTNER JUST MAKE THE PLANT SO
Line_4583	NOW WE DIDDN'T GET TO PUT THE FISHIN ON TO OUR PLAN
Line_4584	YOU JRES E MEAN THAT QUESTION
Line_4585	UM WARM THE STRING IS STRATER AND WAM THE STRAINAS COLUZER
Line_4586	I THINK THIS ONLY HAS ONE THEYRE ABOUT CHANGED
Line_4587	UM WELL I THINK YOU CAN UM SLI MORE ON THIRSTAYS AND DON'T GUESS SLEEP BE ON FRIDAYS
Line_4588	UL JUST EX ME THAT UM IT'S A MINNET YOU GO
Line_4589	WE CHANGED THE PAPER CLIPS UM WE DO TWO FOR SIX EIHT TEN
Line_4590	YOU CHANGE THE PAPER CLOSE IN THIS EXAMPLE
Line_4591	SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
Line_4592	IT'S ABOUT AM IT'S A GRAS AND THERE'S A WIRE AN EX AXIS
Line_4593	THAT'S TO SEE HOW YOU LIKE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE WIRE EX AXIS IS THEN
Line_4594	YOU ARADY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4595	YEAH THE NUMBER OF PACANGJERS IS THE VARIABLE ON THIS TABLE OF DATA
Line_4596	YOU OR DE ASK ME THAT
Line_4597	THINGS FOR ALL YOUR HELP TO
Line_4598	SAME WITH YEAH BIE
Line_4599	WE GOT DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRINGS AND SEEING HOW MANY SWINGS IT WOULD MAKE IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4600	WHEN YOU HAVE A LONG PIECE OF STRING YOU'LL HAVE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS AND FIFTEEN SECANDS
Line_4601	THERE IS A WHOLEBENCH OF PENDUUMS
Line_4602	IN FIFTEEN SECANDS IT DID FIVE SWINGS
Line_4603	A PENEY AD A PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4604	THE BUB MAKES THE TREN SWEN
Line_4605	THE LONGER THE STRING LY THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF SWINGS THE PENDOLUM WILL MAKE
Line_4606	WE JUST FINISHED UP THE PENDULUM EX BEAROMENT
Line_4607	IT'S ABOUT THE PENDULUM LENGTHS AND THE NUMBER OF SWIH THE PEJULAL MAKES
Line_4608	OU CAN FIGERE OUT HOW MEANY OF SOME THING
Line_4609	WHEN YOU USE A GRAF IT TELLS YOU DATA
Line_4610	WHEN YOU USE E GRAF TO HELP YOU PRODICT YOU CAN GET A BETTER CONCLUSION
Line_4611	WITH THE TWENTY LATER STRIING YOU WILL GET FIFTEEN SWEENS
Line_4612	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BULS
Line_4613	PAPER BTS AND WE ARE SEEN HOW MUCH CAPACITY AND PACANGERS ABOUT CAN HOLD
Line_4614	HEY ARE LIVE FULS BUT WE NEAED HEM OUT OF PPAPER CUPS
Line_4615	THERE WAS NOTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT IT WE JUST TUSTED TO SEE HOW IT WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING AND IT DIDN'T
Line_4616	IF YOU PUT TO MANY POM PENIES IN ONE BOUT IT
Line_4617	WELL IF YOU SSTACALED THE PENIES
Line_4618	OCAT THANK YOU BIE
Line_4619	WE FINISHED MAKING OUR BOTS AND THEN WE GRAED ALL OUR BOTS PLUS TWO OTHERS
Line_4620	IT TOLD ME WH THE
Line_4621	YOU ASK ME THAT QUESTION LAST TIME LIKE THE LAST THING YOU SAID
Line_4622	THE PLAIN IS MOVING ACROSS THE STREEN
Line_4623	WOULD SEE THAT H YOUR PLAINE WON'T FLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
Line_4624	WE ONLY FLOW AD ONE DISTANCE THAT IS TWO YARDS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT ANY OTHER DISTANCES
Line_4625	ONE PLAIN IS GOING ON A STRAT STRING AND THE OTHER PLAIN IS LIKE DOING KIN LIKE A DIAGNEAL
Line_4626	I LIKE VISCITIN WITH YOU TO TWO
Line_4627	ANS AND CRAPIYE
Line_4628	WELL IN THE GRASS WE COULOD
Line_4629	UM WELL THE PEN IN VARIABLE WOULD BE LIKE YES SWITCH ONE VARIABLE AT THE TIME
Line_4630	THINK YOU
Line_4631	ARE WE OUT OF TIME R NOT
Line_4632	PUT I TIPED IT ON THE TP BULB AND SWONG IT THFRTE TIMES
Line_4633	UHE M TO PIHER NEUMECRAF
Line_4634	HELP YOU WITH MASS
Line_4635	SWEN LIKE OH AND SWAINS
Line_4636	LUCTHAI
Line_4637	UM STRING L GO ALONGER I THINK
Line_4638	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4639	IN SCIENCE I COULDN'T THINK IT ANY SO I DON'T CHANGE ANY
Line_4640	WHAS ABOUT TESTING YOU'R PRUPAR'S TO SEE HOW FAR IT WANT
Line_4641	THE ANGLE AND THE DISTANCE THE CORT FLOUW
Line_4642	UM THAT THE BULL ON THE TOP IS BIGGER AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS
Line_4643	IT SAS THAT THEY BOTH MENT ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4644	THE ANGA
Line_4645	OBJECT AND MASS LENGTH DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE
Line_4646	UH SOCAY
Line_4647	BECAUSE MAYBE OTHER THINGS WOULDN'T WORK FOR THE GRAF
Line_4648	IY DOMAIN DIFFERENT THINGS EVERY TIME
Line_4649	I DON'T GET IT
Line_4650	WE WERE DOING THE PLAINS AND MAKING GRAFS AND TESTING THEM
Line_4651	A STREEN WITH PAPER CLIP AND THEN PAPENIY
Line_4652	STRING PAPER CLIP AND PENEY
Line_4653	I NOTICED THAT THE SMALL ONE DID THE MOST
Line_4654	THE BIG ONE THEYR'S THE LESS I MEAN TO THE MEDIAM
Line_4655	NOT SHURE I'M NOT
Line_4656	STRAINE PAPER CLIP PENY
Line_4657	LONGER OR SHORTER STRIENGTH
Line_4658	LONG OR CRICH STRIAINGE
Line_4659	SMALLER OR DIFFERENT PAPER CLIP

Line_4661	A PENDULUM WITH STRING A PAPER CLIP AND PENY AND FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4662	LIKE  BOTS
Line_4663	THEY ARE MADE OF CUPS
Line_4664	THEY'RE MADE A BB THEY'RE MADE OF PAPER CUPS
Line_4665	WE GOT PAPER CUPS AND WE FOUND A DICTIONARY AND WE
Line_4666	WE MADE MINES ON THE CUP AND WE CUT WEAIRE THAT WAS TO MAKE BOT
Line_4667	SMALL BEATING BAKE
Line_4668	THERRE BOTS
Line_4669	PUTTING DIMEN OR PENIES FOR PACANGERS AND THE BOT
Line_4670	FOR MY BOLTS SMALL WAYS SEVEN MEADIAMADAT BIG WAS TWENTY FIVE TO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4671	I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW I DON'T KOW
Line_4672	PASCANGERS IN BOTS
Line_4673	THE ONE WITH THE TWENTY HAS MORE THAN THE ONE F THE TWELV

Line_4683	YOU MEASURED THE VOLUTE OF THINGS
Line_4684	THE THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4685	UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_4686	WELL FIFTY MILLEYLITERS IS
Line_4687	WHAT IS CAPACITY
Line_4688	IT HOALD A UM THE CAPACITY OF IT IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4689	WOULDON'T DO A MEASUREING A WATER WITH THREE CUPS

Line_4696	WELL YOU COULD USE FAIRAN HOW YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO USE SELSA ESS UNLESS YOU LIKE NEED TO
Line_4697	IT GETS COLDER
Line_4698	WELL IT'S FIFTY DEGREES CELCIYETS AND IT'S MOREMAR THAN TEN DEGREES CEL CIS
Line_4699	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT CANT BE HIER THAN FIFTY
Line_4700	HOWEL
Line_4701	OH ABOUT WHAT
Line_4702	WELL EVERY MINETE WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_4703	UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVE MEANS
Line_4704	OH OKAY
Line_4705	WE USED THE CHART
Line_4706	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_4707	ING HOTTER IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE GETTING COLDER AND IT MIGHT BE GETTING HOTER
Line_4708	IT DROPED WEAPIDLY
Line_4709	YOUHA OH WHEA WEAL
Line_4710	PILLYBUB JEO BILLY BILLY HI HI
Line_4711	YEAH IT DOUS
Line_4712	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_4713	ABOUT MEASURING THINGS
Line_4714	UM IN CLASS WE USED STRAWS WHICH WAS KIND OF HARD
Line_4715	I THINK MY FRIEND NICK IS MAYBE A METER A THINK
Line_4716	TO THAT IS IT'S LIKE THE DORNOB FROM A DOOR YEAH NECK IS REALLY SHORT
Line_4717	YOU COULD YOU COULD USE YOUR UM YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUM TO DO TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4718	AND  LIKE GUESING
Line_4719	YOU SPRED YOUR HAND APART WITH YOUR PINKIE AND YOUR THUMB
Line_4720	UM NOT EXACTLY SHORE
Line_4721	MAKE SURE IT'S ACURAT AND LIKE EXACT
Line_4722	I M B HOW ARE YOU
Line_4723	I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
Line_4724	UM MOST LIKELY A METER STICK
Line_4725	NOT SHOURE
Line_4726	TO MAKE SHURE LIKE YOU PUT IT YOU HAVE IT STRAT AN AT ALL LIKE FAT AND FOLDED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4727	WE MEASURED OUR ARMS OUR RISCT TO OUR ELBO OUR FOLIT AND OUR HEIGHT
Line_4728	WE DON'T MEASURE U NOSIS
Line_4729	MAYBE A FOOT
Line_4730	YOU ARE USING YOUR PINKIE FOR EACH CENTIMETER
Line_4731	I DON'T KNOW O
Line_4732	NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME FOR ME AT LEAST MAYBE FOR OTHER PEOPLE SOME ARE THE SAME
Line_4733	THAT HIS ARMS AND HIS HEIGHT ARE THE EXACT SAME
Line_4734	SOME ARE BIGER THAN OTHER BODDY PARTS AND SOME ARE SMALLER
Line_4735	UH TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4736	U COULD USE YOUR THUM AND YOUR PINKIE TO MEASURE THEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4737	UM A PENSCIL
Line_4738	HELLO UM UY JUST LIKE STOPED RIGHT THERE
Line_4739	THEY'E ARE THE SAME SIZE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RS THE SAME SIZE IT DEPENDS OF ON HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
Line_4740	THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT LIKE THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT SIZES YEAH
Line_4741	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_4742	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4743	ONES HEAVIER BECAUSE IF IT'S HEAVIER IT LEANS IF IT'S LIGHTER IT DOESN'T LEAN STICKES UP
Line_4744	UM NOT SHOURE
Line_4745	IAM NOT SHUR
Line_4746	THAT ONE OF THEM IS BIGER AND ONE OF THEM IS SMALLER
Line_4747	UM THERE IS TWENTY FIVE GRAM THERE IS TEN GRAMLER'S TWENTY GRAM IT IS ONE GRAM
Line_4748	GOOD BYE I HAVE TO GO SHA
Line_4749	IT I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4750	WHAT
Line_4751	IT'S ABOUT LIKE TWENTY GRAMS AND YEAH JUST ABOUT GRAMS
Line_4752	UM THE THE WASHER THE METAL CHIP AND THE WOOD CHIP
Line_4753	TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS WITH THE JECT UB JECT THAT YOU'RE RAING IS
Line_4754	NOT E NOT EXACTLY SHURE
Line_4755	THAT UM
Line_4756	UM YOU WOULD
Line_4757	ERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAMS FOR FOR IT TO BE THE SAME MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_4758	I THINK IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED
Line_4759	YOU WEIG MASS AND STUFF
Line_4760	THAT UH  I DON'T KNOW
Line_4761	THIN
Line_4762	A I DON'T KNOW NO EXACTLY SURE
Line_4763	DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4764	ITS SPONGES DRYE WET AND SOKED
Line_4765	SIOLK SPUNGE IS REALLY HEAVY
Line_4766	IT'S JUST A DRY SPUNGE IT'S THE DRY SPUNGE IN A CUP HEAVIER THEN NOTHING
Line_4767	IF YOU DON'T KNOW OR IF YOU DO KNOW
Line_4768	THAT A WEH SPUNGE IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN UH
Line_4769	UM IT'S IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SPUNCH IT'S LOT HEAVIER
Line_4770	UM IT WAS IT WAS
Line_4771	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER AS USUWAL
Line_4772	MU EXACTLY SHEARM
Line_4773	UM NOT SHEURE
Line_4774	BUT THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE OF THEM
Line_4775	THAT GOT SCKAPED YESTERDAY
Line_4776	CHELPS
Line_4777	THERE ARE
Line_4778	THE WATER AND THE CUP WILL THE VOLUME THE VOLIOUME IND THE CUP
Line_4779	POURING IT INTO A DIFFERENT CUP LIKE DROPS LITTLE DROPS
Line_4780	YEA THE'RE ABOUT
Line_4781	T'S S TALKING ABOUT THEM JUST MILLAMIETE LILLAMMILLMIETERS MILLALITERS
Line_4782	TEN TEN MAKER LITER
Line_4783	THE SAYING HOW MUCH MILLILITERS YOU UP WATER AND YOUR CUP
Line_4784	UM IM MO
Line_4785	A LIEATER OR NO WEM UH A RULAR IS MN
Line_4786	IT'S A SERRINGE WITH WATER IN IT AND IT'S GET A SQUESED OUT WATER
Line_4787	WU CD JUST YOU WOULD LOOK AT THIS ARRENGE BBECAUSE IT SHOWS ON THE CRENGE
Line_4788	IT REPROSENTS THE MILLMETERS  THAT'S ON THE CRINGE
Line_4789	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MILLIMETERS AND LIETERS AND SERRINGE AND LIKE GRADURATED CILINDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4790	UM IT WAS IT I CAN REMEMBER
Line_4791	THAT IT ENDED UP BEING A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_4792	IT SHOWES HOW MUCH MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE MY GUESS
Line_4793	A GRADUATED SILINDER
Line_4794	YOU MEASURED WAT WELL YOU MEASURE MILLALITERS IN
Line_4795	UM NOT SHOURE
Line_4796	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT
Line_4797	JUST BY LOOKING A IT AND FIGERING OUT
Line_4798	YOU COULD JUST RIGHT THAT AB CEE D ON A CUP AND A I AUM NOT SHURE
Line_4799	THAT THE FIRST CUP THE FIRST CUP IS BIGGER HAS MORE WATER THAN THE SECOND CUP
Line_4800	THAT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU HAVE
Line_4801	JUST ABOUT THE WRIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUID
Line_4802	UM HHMWATERS
Line_4803	UM I THINK IT KEEPS FULL
Line_4804	THAT THEY WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT LIKE KINDS OF VOLUME MEASUREMENT
Line_4805	THAT IT'S FATTER BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME MASS OF VOLUME OR YEAH VOLUME
Line_4806	THAT IF IT'S HITD OR COLED BECAUSE YEAH IT'S UTTER COLD
Line_4807	WHICH ONE IS THE HOTEST OR WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST OR ONE OF THOSE
Line_4808	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4809	YOU FEEL DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF SOULCIIGTE AND FAIRINIGHTE SULCIIS AND FAIRINIGHT
Line_4810	I THINK IT'S A THERMEAROMETER I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME T E THICK
Line_4811	UM LIKE I ROAT DOWN TWENTY
Line_4812	THINK NOTHING REALLY THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT  THING
Line_4813	IT'S ABOUT HOT NOT COLD I THINK MSUR
Line_4814	GETTING THE ANSWER OF SULCIIS
Line_4815	BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF TOAL YOU USE AND THE UNITE TEMPERATURE
Line_4816	THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THE SAME
Line_4817	IT TURNS IN TO FARRAN HIGHT
Line_4818	THAT THE FIRST ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A HUNDRED SOLCIEUS AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIFTY FIVE SOLUS
Line_4819	THAT THE SECONT ONE IS A LOT COLER THAN THE FIRST ONE
Line_4820	THAT IT'S LIKE COUNTING BY TENS LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY
Line_4821	UM THE THERMOMETER GOES DOWN I GUESS
Line_4822	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER MAYBE
Line_4823	THAT IT GOES FROM UM FROM IT'S FROM FIVE TO SIX TO NINE AND THEN TO THIRTEEN
Line_4824	THERE WAS A HUNDRED MINNETS A HUNDRED MINETS I GUESS
Line_4825	THE INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER CHARM THAT WE ACTUALLY USE D TO RIGHT ON
Line_4826	TEMPERATURE AND MINITS THAT IT IS FROM
Line_4827	THE CEM THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN AND CHANGED TO DEGREES SOULCIYSE
Line_4828	YOU COULD ESTIMATE OR STICK YOUR FINGER AND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4829	BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER AND GUESS WELL YOU WELL JUST YEAH BY JUST BY LOOKING AT IT
Line_4830	IF YOU LOOK TAT IT THE CHERMOMETER OR THE NUMBER LINE
Line_4831	THAT IT TURNS COLD TO IT TURNS PRITY COLE AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE GREES SOCY ICE
Line_4832	THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST ONE YEAH
Line_4833	A THE THERMOMETER TELLS YOU U A TEMPERATURE CHANGED
Line_4834	ING AT BY LOOKING AT THE THERMOMETER
Line_4835	THAT IT'S DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND EACH ONE
Line_4836	UM THE WATER IS GETTING HOTTER AND COLDER
Line_4837	ECREADY
Line_4838	UM DOING A ROWSE AND MY MATH
Line_4839	I DON'T KNOW
Line_4840	THE VOLUME OR HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_4841	IT'S HOW UM LONG IT IS FROM LIKE THE FRONT TO THE BACK
Line_4842	IT TELLS ME HOW UM LONG IT IS A CROSS
Line_4843	OF THE THE LENGTH OF THE DISC
Line_4844	I WAS THE STRAW AND AMEASURING TAPE
Line_4845	MEASURING HOW UM LONG UM
Line_4846	SOME WERE SMALLER AND SOME WARE LARGER THAN THE OTHER ONES AND UM
Line_4847	I DON'T KNOW ANY THING ABOUT IT
Line_4848	SOMMER SOMMER SHORLER AND UM GROUP A IS UM LONGER THAN GROUP B BECAUSE UM
Line_4849	IT MEANS THAT IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT THEN WHAT YOU THINK
Line_4850	THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME AND AND EACH GROUP
Line_4851	UM YOU 'RE SUPOSED TO USE UM THE SAME THING ON EACH GROUP
Line_4852	I UM GOT SOME WATER INSIDE THE SERRINGE AND THEN I UM PUSHED IT OUT INTO THE CUP
Line_4853	I CAN USE  THREE
Line_4854	THE CAPACITY IS UM A HUNDRED
Line_4855	THERE IS U HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLLITERS
Line_4856	THEY ALL MEASURE UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4857	IT'S TWO MILLALITERS UH WATER
Line_4858	THEY'RE BOTH DUS THEY'RE BOTH TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WA
Line_4859	THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH THE UM  CUP CAN HOLD
Line_4860	IT'S HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL
Line_4861	WE UM MEASURED
Line_4862	IT IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITALS IN CAPACITY
Line_4863	IT SAID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_4864	IT 'S UM THREE HUNDRED NOMETERS THIT'S VOLUME  PROVLICE GOOD
Line_4865	IT WELL'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MINLLY
Line_4866	HEY'RE ULY VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT
Line_4867	S LABULED WITH UM TEN MILLOLITERS BY UM EACH FOR EACH LINE
Line_4868	I WOULD USE THE CAPACITY IN MILLALITERS
Line_4869	I DON'T KNOWTI DON'TI DON'T DON'IG
Line_4870	I UM WENT
Line_4871	BA WAS COLDEST A WAS UM  A LITTLE MOREMER AND SEE WAS ARE MESCED
Line_4872	WEY  UM CUP IS HOTTEST AND WHICH CUP IS COLDEST
Line_4873	UM AY IS THE SAME AS SE AND UM B IS ZEERAW BGREES CELYES
Line_4874	ITS HOW HOT OR CLERB TH SOMETHIN
Line_4875	IT'S A THEROMOMETER AND UM IT CAN UM FEEL HOW UM HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4876	UM MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD SOME LIQUIDS ARE
Line_4877	THIS THERMOMETEA S MORE ACCURANT
Line_4878	GETS DEGREES CEL CEIS
Line_4879	SELL SEE UM FAIRE IN HIGHT
Line_4880	THE MIDDLE OF FIFTY DUGREES CELCYIS IS TEN AND TEN DEGREES CELLCYIS IS THIRTY DEGREES CELLCYIS
Line_4881	UN
Line_4882	IT UM IT DROPS THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4883	I SAW THAT IT WAS MUCH MUCH COLDER THAN UM EVERY MINETE IT WAS UM MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_4884	IT HAPPENED EVERY ONE MINET
Line_4885	IT WAS UM TWENTY DEGREES TO FIVE DEGREES
Line_4886	IT JUST STAYIED ON D THE BREESE BUTIT NEVER WENT XUP
Line_4887	THE TEMPERATURE AND UM THE TIME A MINETS
Line_4888	UM THE TEMPERATURE
Line_4889	IT'S GETTING MUCH BIGER
Line_4890	IT DROPD UM FIFTEEN DEGREES
Line_4891	COUNTING THE LINES ON THE WEAY
Line_4892	WELL IT'S PRITY EASY TO GET WATER OUT F A CAPICASLS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH PORT
Line_4893	WELL IT GOES TEN MILL MILLILITERS TWENTY MILLILITERS THIRTY MILLIILITERS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4894	WELL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS TOLE BUT MY GUESS IS TO
Line_4895	GOING IT TO THE RUM BY FILLING IT TO THIRTMAR
Line_4896	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I KNOTICE MORNING
Line_4897	UH MONEY W MASIARDI SAI TO YOU I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS I KNOW I NEED TO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4898	I DOWTIGO MARNEETS CEMPROLONCH GEA BYE
Line_4899	IT'S HOW MUCH WWATER A CUP OR SOMETHING CAN HOLD
Line_4900	THAT THERE IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLIMETERS FOR THE CAPACITY
Line_4901	MARNEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_4902	UM AND SO ARE YOU ASKING WHAT DID I DO WELL WHACH IN MY GROUP TO OR WHAT TO DO
Line_4903	THAT TOLLS HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE CAN IS UM YEAH
Line_4904	UM WEL
Line_4905	OKAH HAY MARNING I HAVE TO GO NOW KA
Line_4906	AND SO AFTER WE STUCK OUR FINGERS IN THE AND THE WATER OF THE CUPS RE
Line_4907	WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS
Line_4908	I KNOW THAT'S LIKE HOW HOT OR HOW COLD SOMETHING IS
Line_4909	WE' PUT IN THERMOMETERS UM SO WE' PUT INTO THE THERMOMETERS ANE
Line_4910	I CAN'T TELL WHAT THE THE  B IS BUT
Line_4911	UM THAT SEE MEANS SLCIS
Line_4912	WELL N I DON'T KOW
Line_4913	WELL I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOLCS REALLY MEANS YEX WE'VE JUST GO STARTAED OUR TEMPERATURE UNIT SO
Line_4914	OM I DON'T REALLY KNOW LAURNY
Line_4915	UM YO'RE DUN
Line_4916	LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE TO SAY FIVE DEGREES ARH BUT YOU LOOK AT THE RED STUFF THAT GOES UP
Line_4917	UM WELL THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE RIGHT AR HIER THAN THE ONES ON THE LEFT
Line_4918	OH HO DON'T  LIGHT COULD SEY TEM GOOD
Line_4919	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURE
Line_4920	THE ICE MADE THE WATER COLD
Line_4921	IN SOAND WE PUT THE ICE CUBS IN THAT MADE THE WATER MUCH MORE COLDER THAN IT WAS
Line_4922	OCAH FIVE DEGREES CSULCIOS
Line_4923	EAH UM AND SO THEY CAN GET SUPERCOLD AND TURN TO ICECOU
Line_4924	UM AND SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL TEMPERATURE VERY WELL
Line_4925	AND SO YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN MAYBE A PENNER PENCIL AND THEN YOU CAN RIGHT YOUR RESULTS ON THE PAPER
Line_4926	WELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID MARNEY UM
Line_4927	M WE DIDN'T REALLIED DRAW OR DADA BUT WHE ROT AR DADA
Line_4928	I DON'T ONLY KNOW WHAT ABOUT GRAS MARNEY
Line_4929	WE PUT LIKE UM
Line_4930	THOUT WITH A MINNETE THAT IT TOOK EVERY TIME WE MEASURED
Line_4931	IT'S BECAUSE THEY MEASURED IT LIVE TIMES AND THEN THE TENTRIC TEMPERATURE CUEP CHANGING A LITTLE
Line_4932	I DON'T REALLY KNOW MARE
Line_4933	WE OBSERVED CHANGES MAYBE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINETE
Line_4934	E I DON'T UI DON'T KNOW WAT LOT MONEY
Line_4935	WELL I CANE ONLY REMEMBER WHAT I ROAHT DOWN MARNEY
Line_4936	I THINK IT WAS LIKE MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES CILCI

Line_4941	NO YOU DID NOT REPE YOUR SELF
Line_4942	YES I DO GET THAT
Line_4943	UM WELL WE JUST STOED AIN NO UNIT ABOUT MEASURING THE MECTRIC SISTOM AND BEFORE THAT WE WEARE DOING JEOMETRY
Line_4944	I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LENGTH IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4945	THEY WERE A DIFFERENT SIZE SIZES SHOW EVERY ONE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Line_4946	I UM I'M NOT EXACTLY SO WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_4947	I AM GOOD MARNEY THINK YOU FSKING
Line_4948	UM THE SLOW UP TO DORNAB
Line_4949	THEY ARE ALL THE EMECTRIC THEY ALL UNET TO THE MECTRIC SISTOM
Line_4950	EVERY M PLACESE OF THE UNITED STATES USES THE METRIC SIYSTOM TO MEASURA STUFF
Line_4951	UM I DO NOT KNOW WHI
Line_4952	WHAT YOU COULD ESTIMATE ESTIMATE WHATCH IS BASCICLY LIKE U MAKE OUR VILLMAT GUESS

Line_5086	YOU WOULD NEAND TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAND MEASURE IT
Line_5087	THE PERSON IS MEASURING A IS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5088	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE
Line_5089	UM IT'SS A I FEER I DON'T KNOW
Line_5090	I MEASURED FROM MY RISC TO MY ELBO
Line_5091	THE MY ARM SPAND AND MY HEIGHT
Line_5092	I SEE THAT HER NOSE ON HER EAR EY THE SAME LENGTH
Line_5093	AND JENERAL USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_5094	YOU WOUL YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT
Line_5095	O USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING 'S NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5096	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5097	THAT THE BIGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER AND THEN IT GOMES TO A DECIMETER ANTHEN A CENTIMETER ATHEN A ME MILLIMETER
Line_5098	YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER
Line_5099	I DON'T NON'T KNOW
Line_5100	YOU ENDIAN TLE
Line_5101	I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNT S
Line_5102	IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT E SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS
Line_5103	IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5104	IZ DON'T KNOW
Line_5105	I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5106	YOU I DON'T NEOW I CHING
Line_5107	I FOR I DON'T KNOW
Line_5108	UM YOU ARE USING A SCKEL TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGT OF THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5109	BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_5110	I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM
Line_5111	WE USED PAPER LIPS
Line_5112	HEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACTUA TO FIGGERE AT THE REAL ANSWER
Line_5113	THAT PIXCTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUP THAT IS ONE GRAM
Line_5114	OU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHTS OF THINGS
Line_5115	UM IT WAS ONE GRAM
Line_5116	IT WAS AI GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISCK WAS A GRAMS
Line_5117	THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GARAMS
Line_5118	IT MEANS THAT IT IS EH GRAMS
Line_5119	GRAMS ARE THE METRIC SISTM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK
Line_5120	YOU CAN OU I DON'T KNOW
Line_5121	YOU UM SO YOU HIVE CAN TELL ANYMORE I TEND TO CET IT UP
Line_5122	SO UM YOU DON'T KNOW
Line_5123	IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISCK IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5124	THE CARE AND THE PIXTURE WEIGHES SEVEN D GRAMS
Line_5125	YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE I'S NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
Line_5126	I FICKERED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_5127	A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOME THINGS LESS THAN A GRAM
Line_5128	ONE ILRAN THOUSAND
Line_5129	I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUS AND ONE HUNDRED GRAMSS
Line_5130	OU WOULD USE IT WHEN THER LIKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND
Line_5131	YOU WOULD GET A REALLY ACCURET UM ANSWER
Line_5132	I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT IN A DRY SPONGE AND WATER THAT IT WILL EOBSORBE AND GET MUCH BIGGER
Line_5133	U SILK SPUNGE UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5134	THE SPUNGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SOSPEND
Line_5135	ITS WHENE IT STOPS OBSORBING WATER
Line_5136	WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AN A SPUNGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPUNGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEAIGHTS
Line_5137	UM I  DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY MORE
Line_5138	I NOTICE THAT THE DRY SPON EQUAL THREE GRAMS
Line_5139	YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU GOOD COWN YOU COUN'T THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITH OUT THE SPENSIN IT
Line_5140	I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND UH WE HOT IT WAS THRE GRAM
Line_5141	I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WETHE SPENCH WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_5142	UM THE I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOKED LIE UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5143	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGER OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHTED
Line_5144	I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
Line_5145	YOU CAN HEAUSE A BALANCE TO MAG ER THE WEIHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
Line_5146	YOU USE GRAMS
Line_5147	YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD YOU TAKE A
Line_5148	IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS
Line_5149	YOU CAN USE A VILE
Line_5150	I NOTICE THAT THE FIRST FILE AS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND FILE
Line_5151	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ELECTRICUNETS ARE FOROM MEASURING VOLLUTE
Line_5152	IT'S U LEATER
Line_5153	LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AND TO MILLILITERS
Line_5154	MILLYLITERS AR LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER
Line_5155	I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM ONE HUNDRED MILLILIETERS ON THEM
Line_5156	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND A LITER
Line_5157	E  ARE ONE THAWH CENT ONE THOUSAND MINELA LEATERS AND A LEATER
Line_5158	TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LIEATER
Line_5159	THE PLASTIC CUP
Line_5160	I DO NOT NOW THAT
Line_5161	UM WE USED UM VILES B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5162	IT'S A CEREND WITH UMWATER IN IT
Line_5163	IT MAKES THEM GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAAN STUCK UP A PER VERY PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5164	UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY RAPRESENT
Line_5165	WE FICKURED OUT THE VOLIUME BY USING A CORREND AND  A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5166	THAT OBJECT IS A SURREANGE AND IT HAS THORTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5167	THAT TWOULE IS A GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5168	INOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5169	YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THINGS THAT AR SMALLER THAN A LITER BE YEAH
Line_5170	CEMPACITY IS THE AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPY IP TOP LIKE YEAH
Line_5171	I NOTICE THAT UM AT THE CUPS CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT
Line_5172	I DO NOT NOW
Line_5173	IT'S WHEN YOU IT CANT HOLD ANYMORE WATER
Line_5174	THEYE ARE ALL TWO HUNDRED MIILLITER VESILS
Line_5175	HI DON'ANT KNOW
Line_5176	I OBSERVE THAT THE TALLL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLOLITERS OF WATER
Line_5177	I LEARN THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_5178	IM WELL
Line_5179	AND THE MATH WE SAW WE TRIED TO SEE IF
Line_5180	I OBSERVED THAT IT'S  IT'S CAPACITY AND IT'S CAPACITY IS THREE HUND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILIETERS
Line_5181	YOU COULD USE WATER TO HELP FIGURE AT THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5182	I NOTICE THAT THE LIQUID IS AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_5183	HE PRINTED NUMBER TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN
Line_5184	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5185	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5186	THAT IS THE CAPACITY UF THE SODA CAN
Line_5187	IT STANDS FOR THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5188	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5189	I OBSERVED THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILIETERS
Line_5190	THERE IS A CREND A GRADUATED CILLANDER AND A LEATER A LEATER LIKE CUP THING
Line_5191	YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH UM LIQUID IS IN SOMETHING
Line_5192	WE USE THE MECTRIC CISTOM USES MILLLITERS AND RIGHT NOW IN SCOL WE ONLY USED MILLOLITERS
Line_5193	YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED
Line_5194	IT IS DOING A MATHE EQUASION TO GET YOU TO YOUR ANSWER
Line_5195	SO THAT YOU CAN NO YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
Line_5196	I DISCOVERE VERAD THAT IT WAS I SEAN DO ON'T REALLY DISCOVER ANYTHING
Line_5197	YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CAPA CAER CAPC WATER WAS WARMER
Line_5198	YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER
Line_5199	I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGER OUT UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS CLOEST AND WHICH ONE IS AND BETWEEN
Line_5200	I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_5201	I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
Line_5202	E PUT A SAMMMITER AND
Line_5203	YOU USES THEREMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5204	IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURET THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH
Line_5205	UN SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES
Line_5206	YOU OU WE'RE USING CLCIESS AND THIS UNIT
Line_5207	IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOWN AND WHEN IT GOES DOWN
Line_5208	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5209	I DOM KNOW THAT
Line_5210	UM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5211	IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER
Line_5212	WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGERS
Line_5213	WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE AND THE WATER
Line_5214	UM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAYE
Line_5215	UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT ONE IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH
Line_5216	I DISCOVERID THAT IT GOT MUCH COLDER
Line_5217	IT DROPS LOWER
Line_5218	IT DROP FIFTEENE SELCIIS
Line_5219	THEY CAN FREES
Line_5220	IT GOES DOWN AND IT'S KINDR LIKE CONTRACTING AND SOYEA
Line_5221	YOU CAN RIGHT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND IT
Line_5222	WEOU JUSTPLAD IT I RITING IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND YEAH
Line_5223	DO UM MY DATE AND NUMBERS ON A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER
Line_5224	I NOTICED THAT IN TEN MINIETES IT DROPED DOWN THO FIVE DEGREES AND THENN
Line_5225	I THE PARTS OF THE GRAF I DON'T KNOW WTHAT
Line_5226	GRASS ARE TO HELP YOU LIKE MEASURE AND KEEP TRACKING YOR STUFF
Line_5227	OU PUT NUMBERS ON THE SIDE
Line_5228	IT HELPS YOU KEEP TRACK O LEGE TEN MINETS AS FIVE DEGREES TWENTY MINETS IT'S THIRTY DEGREES LIKE THAT
Line_5229	YOU CAN USE IT TO YET I DON'T KNOW
Line_5230	I PUT LIKE HOW IT DROPED IM HOW I HOW IT DROPED IN TEMPERATURE AND HOW IT RUNS UP IN TEMPERATURE
Line_5231	THEY HELP YOU THEYRE ARE LIKE ABOUT
Line_5232	IT RUNES DOWN REALLY FARNUN IT'S GOING UP
Line_5233	IT HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW HOW IT RISES IN TIME AND THE HOW IT DROPS IN TIME
Line_5234	POR TEN MINNETS
Line_5235	IT GOES UP AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5236	IT'S ITIN COLDER AND WARMER
Line_5237	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5238	AND THEN YOU WOULD ATHEM TOGETHER AND GET YOUR ANSWER OF HOW MUH DIFFERENT IT WAS
Line_5239	YOU CAN COUNT THE TEGRES CELCIES IT DROP
Line_5240	TWHEN IT ETHER GOES DOWN UM THE RED STUFF GOES DOWN ON A CUM THERMOMETER OR UP
Line_5241	UM THE TEMPERATURE IS CHANGING
Line_5242	HI MY NAME IS SOVIE
Line_5243	YES I DO
Line_5244	I I PRESS THE REPEATE BUTIN
Line_5245	YES IT DOUES
Line_5246	UM MEASURING IS WHEN WELL
Line_5247	MEASURING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE HOW LONG SOMETHING IS OR
Line_5248	I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG OR TALL IT IS
Line_5249	LENGTH IS BREUD
Line_5250	ARNEY I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE
Line_5251	ONE IS LONGER THAN THE OTHER BUT I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW
Line_5252	IN MATH WE HAVE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND WE ARE DOING A LOT OF FONY STUFF AND MATH
Line_5253	UM IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR TO THE DOOR NOB
Line_5254	THEY'RE ALL FROM THE MECTRIC CISTM
Line_5255	YOU CAN ESTIMATE
Line_5256	WELL SOMETIMES ESTIMATING IS JUST YESIT
Line_5257	YOU CAN WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_5258	GUESSING HOW LONG WIDE OR THICK SOMETHING IS OR HOW TALL IT IS
Line_5259	ACTUALLY I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5260	YOU CAN USE A MEASURED TAPE OR A RULER OR A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK OR FEET OR INCHIS
Line_5261	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5262	UM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDER STAND THE QUESTION BUT
Line_5263	SO YOU CAN JUST DUBLE A CHACK TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT
Line_5264	IT WAS VERY VERY VERY GOOD AND EASY
Line_5265	ANANAH WEI
Line_5266	WELL UM SOMETIMES IT'S HARD SOMETIMES YOU NEED A FREND TO HELP YOU BUT
Line_5267	FOR THAT I USED A MEASURING TAPE SO IT WAS EASIER THAN USING A METER STICK
Line_5268	THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG
Line_5269	IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG SO IF YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS LIKE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5270	YESTERDAY WE MEASURED WHICH ONE WAS THE HEAVIYEST N WHICH ONE IS THE LIGHTEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDL
Line_5271	THE THE UM THE METAL DISC IS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASTIC DISC
Line_5272	PLASTICK SHOULD BE LIGHTER THAN METAL
Line_5273	YOU COULD MEASURE INSTEAD OF ESTIMATING
Line_5274	THE BALANCED AND MAYBE MY HEAUNS
Line_5275	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5276	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_5277	IT SAIYS THAT SOMETHING EQUALS ONE GROUP
Line_5278	I E DON'T KNOW
Line_5279	THAT THE THAT  STUFF WE U THE MATERIALS THAT WE USED WERE  HEAVIER
Line_5280	WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANY MEASUREMENT IND MASS
Line_5281	WEVE BEEN USING THE EMETRIC CISTOM
Line_5282	THE LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD ON THE RIGHT CUP EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5283	TELLS ME THAT THE WOOD CHIP IS THREE GRAMS
Line_5284	WELL IF YOU PUT LET'S SAY
Line_5285	TWO GRAMS
Line_5286	YOU CAN ESTIMATE HOW TALL OR HOW MUCH THEY WEAY
Line_5287	N'T WHAT A REFERANCE IS YET
Line_5288	THEY'RE REFERENCES I'M GUESSING
Line_5289	TO BE MEASURED COMPLETLY STRIGHT
Line_5290	YOU NEED SEVENTY GRAMS TO MEASURE THIS CAR TO MAKE IT COMPLEATE LY MEASURED
Line_5291	BCAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SMALL GRAM PIECES AND IT WON'T MEASUREMENT STRICTLY
Line_5292	MAYBE YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW HOW HOW HEAVY IT IS FOR A RECIPIE OR SOMETHING IN YAR CUP BOOK
Line_5293	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_5294	GET A ONE HUNDRED GRAM PIECE OR USE IT DIFFERENT THING THEN A BALANCE BEAM
Line_5295	TWO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BRAMS
Line_5296	YOU NE I DON'T KNOW
Line_5297	THE GRAVEL IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAMS
Line_5298	SO THEY MEASURE EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5299	I HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT KILOGRAMS YET
Line_5300	YOU USE IT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT'S TWO HEAVY TO USE FOR GRAMS
Line_5301	HEVIER THAN HEAVIER THAN A BOK
Line_5302	I HAVE TO GO GOOD BYE MARNEY
Line_5303	IT'S GOING VERY WEL
Line_5304	WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING MUCH MEASUREMENT BUT WE'VE BEEN BALANCING THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN USING A BALANCE
Line_5305	WELL IT'S DRY SO IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS A SPONGE WITH THAT WAS WET SO IT'S PRETY LIGHT
Line_5306	L WHAT SPONGE IS  SPONED WELL UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_5307	WHEN IT IK TO PULL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP
Line_5308	YOU PUT IT ON A BALANCE AND THEN USES TO KEEP ON PUTING WEH
Line_5309	UM THE THE DRES SPUNGE IEQUALS THREE GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S LEVELED OUT ON THE BALANCE
Line_5310	THE WET SPUNGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPUNGE BECAUSE THE WET SSPUNGE HAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT
Line_5311	THE DRY SPUNGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS
Line_5312	THE WEIT'S SPUNGE IS SIX TEEN GRAMS
Line_5313	UM THE  THE WEIT SPUNGE IS
Line_5314	THE SPUONGE HELD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_5315	HICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5316	RY GOOD I AM VERY VERY GOOD
Line_5317	WE HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING WITH AN EMPTY CUP
Line_5318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5319	CU THAT THAT THE CUP CAN HOLD THAT MANY VILES OF WATER AND SIDE OF IT
Line_5320	YOU COULD USE VILS
Line_5321	GROUP ONE IS BIGGER THAN GROUP TWO
Line_5322	IT WOUN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS THEN OTHER PEOPLE
Line_5323	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT IN CLASS SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5324	IT'S JUST MARKING THE SPOT
Line_5325	HERE IS ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS FILLED UP AND THAT
Line_5326	THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LITER
Line_5327	W MUCH WATER THERE IS AN'T A CUP OR HOW MUCH JUSE OR SOMETHING
Line_5328	ERE IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND ONE LIATER
Line_5329	YOU COULD USE THE CIRMRENGE
Line_5330	IT SAYS LIKE EAT LITERS THIRTY EIT LITERS I MEAN MILLILITERS
Line_5331	UM WELL ACTUALLY YESTERDAY IT WASN'T THERE FOR SIENS SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5332	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T HERE YESTERDAY AND SCIENCE
Line_5333	I DON'T KNOW HOW I FIGURE IT OUT VOLLU
Line_5334	WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT A SILANDER OR A SIRVIANGE
Line_5335	I THINK IT'S CALLED A SORRANGE
Line_5336	I DIDDN'T USE A SERRANGE
Line_5337	I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A CIRANGE CAN HOLD
Line_5338	I DON'T KNOW I NEVER WORKED WITH THIS THE OTHER DAY SO
Line_5339	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT TOAL
Line_5340	I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD DESCRIBE THAT
Line_5341	WE COULD MEASURE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER
Line_5342	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT I'M JUST USSING NOTHING
Line_5343	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5344	THAT'S TO HARD I DON'T KNOW
Line_5345	ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
Line_5346	UM THE SECOND CUP  DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER AND IT AS THE FIRST CUP
Line_5347	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5348	THE SODA INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN ONLY FILLS UP TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY
Line_5349	YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA CAN IN IT SAYS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF SODA IS N'T THERE
Line_5350	YOU NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAIY TO THE TOP IT'S ONLY FILLED MOSTLY TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL THE WAY
Line_5351	THE PRINTED NUMBER IS TELLING YOU THAT THE AMOUNT OF SODA THAT IS IN THAT KEAN IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5352	THERE IS WELL THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF LIQUID INSIDE OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5353	THE LIQUID OF THE VOLLUME WAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAPACITY OF THE SODA CAN
Line_5354	CAPACITY OF THE CAN IS THREE HUNDRED
Line_5355	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT OR THE SAME
Line_5356	THERE IS A SPRINGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THING AIN THE MIDDLE IS BUT THE CUP IS ONE LEIATER
Line_5357	UM THERE IS NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND NINE HUNDRED MILLILITERS MAKES ONE LITER
Line_5358	I WOULD USE A SERRINGE INSTEAD OF SOMETHING ELSE
Line_5359	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO THAT BUT MARNEY I'M GOING TO GO NOW BYE BYE
Line_5360	IT'S TRYING TO FIGUR OUT WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE IS THE COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN THE MIDDAL
Line_5361	UM ONE IS FORMAL OR HOTTER THAN THE OTHER
Line_5362	TO SEE HOW HOT COLD OR WARM SOMETHING IS
Line_5363	BECAUSE FINGERS DON'T WORK
Line_5364	IT MEASURES THE WEIT OR TEMPERATURE OR LENGTH OF SOMETHING
Line_5365	I THINK THE UNITS CALLED SOLCIS
Line_5366	I DON'T KNOW THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MAY BE LATER I WILL
Line_5367	THAT IT'S NOT AS COLD HOT I MEAN
Line_5368	HOT WATER IS WARMER THAN ICE WATER BECAUSE ICE IS IN THE WATER
Line_5369	O GAY SO IN THIS PIXTURE YOURE PORE AND
Line_5370	WELL YOU'RE POURING ICE WATER AND TO WARM WATER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
Line_5371	IT WOULD GET WARM AND COLD THE ICE WATER WOULD MAKE THE WARM WATER COLDER BUT THE WARM WATER WOULD MAKE THE ICE WATER WARMMER
Line_5372	YOU COULD ESTIMATE
Line_5373	WELL I NEVER FIGURED THAT OUT
Line_5374	IT'S GOING VERY GOOD
Line_5375	IT GETS AHOLDER
Line_5376	YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER FEARRON HEIGHTE OR SOLCIS
Line_5377	WELL WHEN I GET IT I USED A THERMOMETER
Line_5378	T'S LITTLE SQUARS IT'S GOT THE AREA AND THE UM
Line_5379	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YEAH
Line_5380	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5381	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THAT IS
Line_5382	IT'S GOING DOWN OR UP
Line_5383	SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES OR SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT CHANGES
Line_5384	UM A CUPL OF MINETS
Line_5385	YOU COULD USE THA THERAMOMETAL OR YOUR FINGER S FI YOUR FINGERS ARENT THE BEST UM WEIGH TWO BUT IT IS ONE WAY
Line_5386	TWO SULCIES STOWN
Line_5387	WE LOOKED OUT IT AND THEN WE RECORDERED IT ON A PAPER
Line_5388	YOU COULD READ THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE THE MARKS BECAUSE THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5389	HE UM THE RED PART GOES DOWN OR UP BUT IF IT STAYES THEN IT'S NOT CHANGE IT
Line_5390	WHATEVER IS IN THE WATER THE MERMATERIALS ICE HOT WATER THAT MAKES IT CHANGE
Line_5391	STUDYING MAGNETISM AND PLAYING WITH MAGNETS
Line_5392	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASRM WE DID THIS EXACT SAME THING AND UM THAT HAPPEND
Line_5393	WASHERS A D CELL AND RAT  MENTAL ROT
Line_5394	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT WON'T LET THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO ALLTHE WAY THROUGH
Line_5395	WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH CIRCUITS WITH BATTERIES WIRES AND MOTORS ARE LIGHT S AND UH SWITCH
Line_5396	I PUT THE STRAW IN AROUND PLACE BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A STRIP OF METAL
Line_5397	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5398	I ACTUALLY JUST REMEMBER THAT A ELMINIM DOES STICK BECAUSE IT IS METAL JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
Line_5399	NO NOT EXACTLY IT JUST KEEPS  PEOPLE SAFE FROM ELECTRICUTING THEMSELVES OR GEING SHOCKED OR GETTING HEART
Line_5400	BRASS HOLE A MEAN WASHER AND NOTHING ELSE
Line_5401	IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MAGNETS
Line_5402	WE'VE BEEN CEILECTRICITY IN USING CIRCUITS AND THEN TRODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5403	THE BULBS ARE BOTH LOYING UP BUT IN OUR CLAS THE WE COULDN'T GET HIM TWO
Line_5404	IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF NEGATIVE AND GOES IN TO POSITIVE AND SO IT TRAVELS THROUGH AND SO YEAH
Line_5405	IT ALWAYS HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE ANDNOT BUT NEGATIVES AND THAT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SO YEAH
Line_5406	THE BATTERY ALWAYS HAS TO GFLOW BACK INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVES
Line_5407	LEARNING ABOUT THE WATER SYCLE
Line_5408	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
Line_5409	THE TWO THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TRYING TO GET TO GETHER THROUGH THE PLANK OF WOOD
Line_5410	E HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_5411	I SE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5412	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS
Line_5413	THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THEY ARE NOT SHARING SO THAT THEY LIGHT UP WHIL AN THE OTHER ONE THEY ARE SHARING THE ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT
Line_5414	THAT PARALLEL CIRCUITS HAVE ONLY ONE PAT NO TWOTH TWO PATHWAYS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ONE PATHWAY
Line_5415	THEY ARE JUST TWO LITTLE CIRCUITS COMBINED
Line_5416	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWMING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND POUNT INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5417	ONE IS THE BATTERY AND TWO ARE THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5418	I SEE ON THE LEFTHERE IS A NON FARWELL AND I SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE
Line_5419	THAT IF ITTHROUGH PARALLEL CIRCUIT ITS A LOT BRIGHTER LIKE AN U HOUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_5420	THAT IT IS MOSTLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5421	THERE IS ONE BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_5422	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF POWER
Line_5423	WIRES ARE ABLE TO TAKE ENERGY FROM THE D CELLN ATTATCH IN TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5424	THE BULB SHOWS YOU IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR RIGHT YOU MIGHT SHOCK YOURSELF
Line_5425	POSITATIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_5426	WHICH END IS ON THE POSITIVE AN CHOINS ON THE NEGATIVE
Line_5427	THE WIGHT BULB IS NOT GETTING IN ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIRES ATTATCHED TO THE TWO ENDS SO THAT IS NOT LIGHTING UP
Line_5428	I HAVE TO ATTATCH ONE TO THE SIGTE OF IT AND ONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_5429	IT IS RIGHT AND LARESTOF THEM ARE NOT
Line_5430	THE CANTHEY CUNOCEIT
Line_5431	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_5432	A NAIL COULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN IF YOU ATTATCH IT TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE SWITCH IT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR SIP
Line_5433	ALL THE CONDUCTORS ARE MADE FROM METAL
Line_5434	WELL THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU JUST MADE IT OUT OF PLAINE METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT THE IRON IN IT IT WILL WORK
Line_5435	THEY ARE COVERED WITH PLASTICK
Line_5436	I OFFEND DERRING SHIING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS CAN STICK
Line_5437	UM THE MAGNET FORCE BETWEEN THEM IF YOU SLIP A MAGNET AND YOU TRIE TO PUS THEM TOGETHER THE MAGNET FORCE PUSHES UMB UPPART
Line_5438	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING ONE MAGNET STICK TO THE OTHER EVEN THOUG IT'S IF BETWEEN A BLOCK OF WOOD
Line_5439	THE MAGNET FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNET STICK TOGETHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET IT MOVES THE OTHER
Line_5440	THE MAGNET FORCE IS PUSHING THE ARD
Line_5441	WELL THE MAGNET PORCH IS PSING THEM TOGETHER THAT MAKES HON STICK AND IF YOU MAVE PLAN IT MOVES
Line_5442	MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING THEM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5443	ES IT CAN GO THROUGH OTHER MTELALS
Line_5444	THE MAGNETIC FOURCES GOING THROUGH THE NAIL CONNECTING TO THE PAPER CLIP MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5445	IRON IRON METAL OR STEEL
Line_5446	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5447	IT IS LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS FROM ONE BATTERY
Line_5448	WELL IT HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY IT WILL MEAER YOUH
Line_5449	THAT ONE'S CAIN IT TUFF FOR ME
Line_5450	I ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5451	WELL  THE PIXTURE ON THE RIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T BRIGHT AND ON THE PICTURE OND THE LEFT THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_5452	THAT'S GOING A TUFF ONE FOR MEE
Line_5453	THAT'S CEN A TUFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5454	THE BLU DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLYING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5455	UH THAT'S CONNG A TOFF ONE FOR ME
Line_5456	ELL IT GRIPELLES OMNEGATIVE END INTO THE POSITIVE AND AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND THEN COMES OUT AGAIN
Line_5457	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM NO I MEAN YEAH LIKE MAGNETISM
Line_5458	I DON'T KOW WHAT YOU MEAN MARNEY
Line_5459	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUM MEAING ABOUT THAT MARNEY
Line_5460	THAT THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5461	THAT THERE IS ONE LONG WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY AND ONES SHORT WIRE CONNECTING TO THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5462	WELL PART OF IT RONG IT DOESN'T
Line_5463	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THAT MEANS IT'S ON SO YEAH
Line_5464	THE ELECTRO MAGNET AND THEN IT GOES AROUND THAT PICKS UP THE METAL OBJACTS AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO POSITIVE
Line_5465	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE ELECTRICITY IS ON'T FLOWING
Line_5466	ACTS LIKE A MAGNET WHEN IT'S TOUCHING SOMETHING MADE OUT OF IRON
Line_5467	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPAND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING
Line_5468	WELL  FUL OF ELECTRICITY CANORDIC WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES HAVE SOMETHING TO KIND OF CONNECT TO
Line_5469	THE RIVIC CAN STAND MAGNETIC OH FOR CRIT SOME TIME
Line_5470	WELL IN SCIENCE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5471	ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Line_5472	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING WATER AND MAGNETISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5473	IT'S A MAGNET THAT ATTRACTS IT'S  OPPOSIT AND I DOES NOT ATTRACT IT'S  SAIGNTS
Line_5474	IT ATTRACTS THINGS WELL
Line_5475	IT'S ATTRACTING THINGS THAT ARE STEEL OR  IRON
Line_5476	UM IT DOESN'T DO ANY MAIT DOESN'T STICK TO ANY MATERIALS THAT ARN'T STEEL OR IRON
Line_5477	UM THERE IS IRON THERE STEEL THERE IS O MOCKS WOOD PLASTICK COPPER AND A SPONGE
Line_5478	UM WELL THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE UM SOM UM MOSTLY METAL AND YEAH
Line_5479	I THINK THAT IRON AND STEEL AS A WROCK SO IT MAY HAVE A LITTLE CONTAINING IN THAT ROP
Line_5480	YOU ASK ME THAT BUT UM IT IT STICKS TO IRON AND STEEL MOSTLY
Line_5481	MAGNETS USUALLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL AND
Line_5482	UM THE THE STEEL ANNAIL UM STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMINIATA NAIL DOES NOT
Line_5483	AN ALUMINIUM NAIL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT HAS SUPPOSED TO GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_5484	UM THE ALUMINIUM NAIL UM DOES NOT HAVE THE MATERIAL IN IT THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET AND THE STEEL NAIL DOES
Line_5485	UM I THINK THAT UM THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TOGETHER AR ON OPPOSIT SIDES AND THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TOGETHER ARE
Line_5486	IRKING OUT MAGNETS AND WATER
Line_5487	UM THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS AND THE ONE SIDE THAT IT OVER POWERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNET
Line_5488	UM THE THE UM WASHERS HUH AR THERE IS ENOUGH WASHERS THAT IT OVER POURS TOECTED
Line_5489	UM THEY THEY STILL ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT
Line_5490	BLOCKS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5491	HERE STILL A BIT OF MAGNETIC FIELD THERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A STRONG AS IT WAS WHEN I ONLY HAD LIKE A CUPLE SPACERS
Line_5492	UM IT'S CALLED MAGNETIC FIELDS AND IT IT OPPI OPSIT ATRACT AND UM THE SAME D CRAD TRACTS
Line_5493	UM YOUORADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_5494	TWO BULBS AND THE AVE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELIN THROUGH TWO CIRCUITS
Line_5495	UM THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BRIGHTER AND ONE ON THE LESST ISN'T BRIGHTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FORMATION
Line_5496	IT'S LO DIFFER
Line_5497	UM IT'S BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANOTHER ELECTRIBULB
Line_5498	UM THERE'S THE ELECTRI THEYRE THE SIMBLE FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY TRAVELING TROUGH THINGS
Line_5499	IT'S TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BULBS
Line_5500	THERE IS ONE FOR EACH BULB
Line_5501	IT GOES THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND IT JUST KEEPS GO TRAVELING A CIRCUIT FOR EACH SIDE
Line_5502	IF ON THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S EACH WOLB HAS A SEPARATE THING
Line_5503	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH AND IS GOING THROUGH ITSEPARIT PATHWAY
Line_5504	PROABLY PARALLEL
Line_5505	LECTRICITY IS RESEMBLED BY BLUE TRAVELING DOTS
Line_5506	UM I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
Line_5507	UM DO YOU MEAN STRING OF CRISMES LITS
Line_5508	UM THERE IS WASHERS THERE'S A D CELL BATTERY THERE'S A WIRE A SWITCH A WHOLDER AND THE STEEL ROTD
Line_5509	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TO AND IT ATTRACTS THINGS IF IT'S A MAGNET

Line_5514	IT PICKS UP THE WATH THE ELECTROMAGNET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5515	IT'S CLOSED
Line_5516	UM AND SWITCH WHEN WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST ACTIVATES THE ELECTRICITY AND PICKS UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5517	UM THE BATTERY IS MAKING ELECTRICITY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND PICKING UP ALL THE WASHERS
Line_5518	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED ALL THE WAY SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5519	IT'S THE  IT IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WHICH PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5520	UM WELL BASICALLY S UNTIL THE BATTERY LUN RUNS OUT OR THE SWITCH IS TURNED OFF
Line_5521	UM THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL IN A FUL CIRCUIT
Line_5522	UM UH I'VE SEEN PAPER CLIPS PE TEMPERMARY MAGNETS YEAH
Line_5523	SULATER BY
Line_5524	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND A LITTLE BIT OF WATER NOT REALLY
Line_5525	UM A BATTERY UM A LIGHT BULB SOME WIRE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A WHOLDER I GUESS
Line_5526	UM THE MAGNET TE WIRE THE LIGHT BULB AND THE PHOLDER
Line_5527	UM THEYRE UM BASICALLY THERE' SORT OF A MAGNET AND THER BATTERIES

Line_5533	ELECTRICITY WHICH IS LIKE SORT OF MAGNETISM
Line_5534	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS AMOUNT
Line_5535	UM LIKE A PLACE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH LIKE A TUNNEL
Line_5536	UM IT'S
Line_5537	UM IT'S A RECEIVER AND THEN IT PROBABLY RECEIVES ELECTRICITY
Line_5538	UM THE ELECTRICITY COMES TO IT
Line_5539	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO IT AND IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5540	ELECTRICITY TRAVELING THROUGH A CIRCLE
Line_5541	ELECTRICITY TRAVELING IN A CIRCLE
Line_5542	UM IT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN IT GOES THND IT GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND THEN THE MOTOR GENARATES ELECTRICITY AND IT TRUS S THE MOTOR TO MOVE
Line_5543	IT TURNS YOU ELECTRICITY ON AND OFF
Line_5544	UM THE ELECTRICITY MAKES A FOUL CIRCL THROUGH THEM
Line_5545	THE MOTOR THE BATTERY AND THE SWITCH
Line_5546	UM YOU WOULD PUT THE LEVER DOWN
Line_5547	T LETS THE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH PROPERTY
Line_5548	STUDYING BATTERIES AN ELECTRICITY
Line_5549	THERE ARE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY DUMVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5550	UM THERE IS A BATTERY A MOTOR A SWITCH A WIRE A LIGHT AND A BEAST
Line_5551	UM THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5552	S A BATTERY ITHEY HAS ONE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE NEAGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S A SOURCE
Line_5553	S A SOURCE OF UH ELECTRICITY
Line_5554	IT UM IT'S A A SORCE FOR ELECTRICITY AND IT HELPS THE ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH THEIR OBJECTS
Line_5555	IT'S THE MAN BACE OF THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5556	IT'S THE PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5557	UM THEY ARE THE PATHWAY OF WHERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUG
Line_5558	UM IT'S A CIRCLE WERE THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH
Line_5559	ELECTRICITY TRANELS THROUGH A CIRCLE
Line_5560	CTRICITY'S TRAVELING THROUGH AND IT GOES PASS THE MOTOR AND IT TURNT CAUSES THE MOTOR TO SPIN
Line_5561	A THE ELECTRICITY COMES TO THEM
Line_5562	IT GOES IN A FUL CIRCLE WHEN THE SWITCH IS DOWN AND IT'S UP IT CUT OFF
Line_5563	IT UM IT MAKES ELECTRICITY TRAVEL ON A CIRCUIT AND SPENDS THE MOTOR
Line_5564	IT'S  SCIMATTIC AND IT SHOWS THE LIGHT BULB AND THE UM BATTERY
Line_5565	IT'S UH IT CENMBLES A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY
Line_5566	A SWITCH A BATTERY AND A MOTOR
Line_5567	WE HAVE BEN  WE HAVE BEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETS
Line_5568	IT HAS TO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LEAE THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_5569	THE MAGNET THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP
Line_5570	WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH
Line_5571	THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS
Line_5572	WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM
Line_5573	IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THEN YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT
Line_5574	YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5575	YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FUN EXSPECIALLY THE MESSY ONES
Line_5576	THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP
Line_5577	UM THERE ARE TWO
Line_5578	BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BURN BRIGHTER
Line_5579	THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRAGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD
Line_5580	TO DAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK
Line_5581	TO DAY WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A DEAD BATTERY
Line_5582	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS SORTIF SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_5583	ONE IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ANOTHER IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5584	ON IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_5585	UM IT HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5586	UM THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT
Line_5587	IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT O THEN UM  NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_5588	WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHENE I CLICED ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONE DIDDN'T BURN OUT
Line_5589	UM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH VERY MUCH CONNECTED TO THE UM D CELL
Line_5590	U PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF ONE BULB LIGHTS OUT BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHERS WILL STILL LIGHT
Line_5591	THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT AS WELL AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_5592	UM WA'S ONLY TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5593	UM THER WAS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT
Line_5594	WE HAVE BEEN MAKEING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5595	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING AROUND OR ELSE THE ENERGY WON'T REACH THE MAGNET SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_5596	IF YOU TURN IT IF YOU CLOSED THE SWITCH THEN ITS SORT OF TURNS THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON SORA LIKE A LIGHT BULB
Line_5597	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT IN A SORT OF IN A CIRCLE OR ELSE THE IT WON'T FLOW CORECTLY
Line_5598	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5599	TEMPORARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG
Line_5600	UM ACTUALLY IT HAS TO
Line_5601	ONE IS CONNECTED UM NOT IM CORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_5602	IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5603	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A REUT
Line_5604	IT'S THE UM ENERGY SOURCE THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE WIRON TO CREATE THE ELEPECTRICITY
Line_5605	I SEE A D CELL A LIGHT BULB A REALLY SMALL LIGHT BULB AND SOME WIRE
Line_5606	THOSE ARE THE WIRES WHICH THE ENERGY TRAVELS THROUGH TO MAKE THE MOTOR START
Line_5607	UM WEL IT CHARGES THINGS
Line_5608	UM THE ENERGY IT COMES IN FROM ONE END AND UM COMES OUT AND THE OTHER
Line_5609	IT IS UM
Line_5610	IT IS UM CHARGING THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR GOES AND THAT'S PRITY MUCH YET
Line_5611	IT SHOWES THE UM THE CIMBLES
Line_5612	UM I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR
Line_5613	IF THEY WEAREN'T UM NEXT TO THE UM FOR THE MOTOR OR THE D CELL SIMBLES THEN IT WOULDN'T RUN
Line_5614	UM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDES
Line_5615	WE JUST FINISHED UM LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY AND CLASS RIGHTN I A CUPL OF MINETS AGO
Line_5616	THEN THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH TTO THE LIGHT BULB SO UM THE LIGHT BULB CAN NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5617	WE'VE BEEN STUDY ANN MAGNET ISM ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5618	WELL THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER UM MAGNETS OATTRACT EACH OTHER
Line_5619	UM GIVING EACH OTHER WAY THEY ARE REPELLING
Line_5620	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_5621	UM WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING PARALLEL CIRCI
Line_5622	WELL IF IT'S NOT A PARALLELL CIRCUIT THE OTHER ONE WILL BURN OUT BUT IT'SO IF IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WON'T BURN OUT
Line_5623	THAT THE WIRES UM ARENT LIKE GRELLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER
Line_5624	IF THERE IS ANOTHER LIGHT BULB OR UM THEY ALL BEURN OUT
Line_5625	UH WELL UH THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING FASTER AND THE PARALLEL UM CIRCUIT
Line_5626	WELL IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FAST IT'S FASTER THEN THE SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5627	AS MORE ELECTRICITY A MORE POWER
Line_5628	OR POWER THEN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_5629	BUT IT HAS MORE WIRES
Line_5630	ASHWAY AND FOR THE PARALLELL IT'S TWO PATHWAIYTES WHICH IS GIVING IT MORE POWER
Line_5631	WE'VE ALL BEEN DOIN WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
Line_5632	THEYRE UM TUFF THAT ARE LIKE THAT I USE ELECTRICITY
Line_5633	THAT IT'S PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5634	IT IT'S GIVING IT MORE POWER THE MAGNET MORE POWER
Line_5635	WHEN WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A KIND F U MAGNET
Line_5636	YES UH
Line_5637	ONLY YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5638	I HAVE TO GO MARNEY SEE YOU
Line_5639	AY PENSTAN ELECTRICITY
Line_5640	THEY'EARE WIRES AND ELECTRICITY UH POWER TRAVELS THROUGH THEM
Line_5641	THAT IT HAS POWER IN SIDE IT
Line_5642	HIT HAS A LOT OF ENERGY
Line_5643	UM THE BETTERY IS UM ELEPETRICITY IS RUNING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GIVING IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR IS SPINING
Line_5644	IT'S GOING IN CIRCLES AND IT'S GIVING POWER TO THE MOTOR
Line_5645	WOH THE MOTOR HAS UH FOR GET TO BE RUNNING AND IT'S ELECTRICITY
Line_5646	WELL A CLOSE CIRCUIT IS WHEIRE EVERYTHING GOES LIKE IN CIRCLES
Line_5647	UM WELL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING SO IT'S CLOSED
Line_5648	UH UM IT CARRIES POWER
Line_5649	IT MAKES THE ELECTRICITY RUN AND IT LETS THE MOTOR YOER UM SPINA RUN
Line_5650	UM CLOSED CIRCUITS UM GOING CIRCLES
Line_5651	IT'S OFF BECAUSE THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING GIVING IT POWER
Line_5652	I SEE AN M ANDUM SIMPLE
Line_5653	WELL IN ORDER TO LIKE THE BULB THERE NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER WIRE AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A WIRE IN ORDER TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5654	IR MADE I OUT OF METAL
Line_5655	NERGJER IS FLOWRIN FLOWING THROUGH THEM
Line_5656	ECT THE W YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UH WHERE THE OTHER WIRE IS SITTING

Line_5749	THE MAGNET STUCK TO THE ONE CAUSE THE TO THE TWO SIDES UM AND T WELL
Line_5750	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE ONE BUT THEN THE OTHER WILL BES ONE SIDE AND IF YOU FLIP THE MAGNET OVER THEN ONE OF THE SIDES WON'T STICK
Line_5751	WELL THE MAGNETS U I CANT REMEMBER ANYONE
Line_5752	UM I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
Line_5753	CAN'T THINK OF ANY M
Line_5754	THERE IS TE WORDS THAT UM YOU LIKE PUT STUFF ON IT LIKE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON YOUR DESCK
Line_5755	UM YOU TRY TO PYOU PUT UM WIRES ON IT AND A MOTOR AND YOU TRY TO FIG EIT OUT WHEIRE THE UM WIRES ARE
Line_5756	THERES A WIRE CONNECTED UM TO D AM A
Line_5757	IT CONNECTS TTHESE UM I THINK THER BRASS THINGS OR THEY MIGHT BE STEEL
Line_5758	WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING THE LITTLE GOULD THING ON TOP
Line_5759	IT'S WIRE INSIDE IF THE MISTERY BORD
Line_5760	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH FORE WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5761	WELL THE UM CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM H I FORGOT WHAT A CIRCUIT WAS
Line_5762	WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THEN IT'S GOING BACK
Line_5763	THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY I THINK
Line_5764	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE D CELL I THNK
Line_5765	THE UM LIGHT BULBS  LIKE ARE BRIGHTER WHEN YOU WHEN THERE S TWO BATTERIES BUT THERE DIMMER WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE
Line_5766	IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHTER
Line_5767	UM I DON'T KNOW AM BIE
Line_5768	I WASN'T HERE FOR SCIENCE DAY SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_5769	ON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID CAUSE THAT WAS N'T HERE FOR SCIENCEE
Line_5770	OUM I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING BECAUSE I WAS N'T HERE TO DAY
Line_5771	I CAN EXPLAIN AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_5772	MAGNETS ARNT REALLY STICKING I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OF SPACERS
Line_5773	I DON'T KNOW THAT I CANT OBSERVE ANY THING ELSE NE
Line_5774	I DON'T I CAN'T FORGET THAT THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_5775	WE'VE BEEN DONG STUFF WITH THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5776	WELL UM THE UM THE D CELL BATTERY IS LIGHTING THE TWO UM  LIGHT BULBS
Line_5777	THE ONE IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS UM BRIGHTER
Line_5778	THE BLUE DACT IS THE UM ENERGY OR THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES AND GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEM COMING BACK THROUGHTHE BATTERY
Line_5779	UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUSS SIDE
Line_5780	TWO CIMBLES ON THE SIDE EQUAL LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE TWO CIMBLES IN THE MIDDLE EQUAL I UM BATTERY
Line_5781	IT MEANS IT HAS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5782	IT'S GOING REALLY GOOD I MEAN PRETYGOOD
Line_5783	I THOHT WHAT  I FORGOT WHAT I WAS DOING A SCIENCE
Line_5784	UM WELL IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE WEIGH HA FORGOT SORRY
Line_5785	WELL IF YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE D CELL AND THEN YOU TUCHED T THE OTHER END OF THE TWO WIRES TOGETHER IT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5786	WELL THE D CELL WIS LIKE THE SOURCE OF UM OH I FORGOT
Line_5787	THINK LIKE THE D CELL IS LIKE THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5788	WELL IF YOU PUT LIKE WIRES IN A CIRCUIT UM UH I FORGOT
Line_5789	A CIRCUIT CAN IF YOU ATTATCH WIRES TO THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT CAN MAKE THE LIGHT BUCH UM LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_5790	THE UM WIRES ARE TAKING POWER FROM THE UM D CELL PRITY MUNCH THEN IT'S GIVING THE POWER TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5791	I THINK IT MIGHT BE LIKE ELECTRICITY BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5792	IT'S WERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES UM TO THE D CELL UND YEAH
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAP TO J THE WA ONE OF THE WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB ELSO IT WON'T LIGHT
Line_5794	WELL ONE NEEDS TO TOUCH ON THE BOTTOM ONE NEADS A TOUCH ON THE SIDE ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WON'T TURN ON
Line_5795	MORE OH I DON'T REALLY KNOW SA
Line_5796	I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS MAYBE  I DON'T KOW
Line_5797	WELL WE WERE LIKE DOING THE S THING WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
Line_5798	WELL WE USED A WIRE A D CELL BATTERY A MOTOR AND A LITTLE PLATFORM AND THEN A SWITCH
Line_5799	WELL THE D CELL CONA IS LIKE THE IS THE ELECE TRICK SOURCE PRITTY MUCH
Line_5800	HE D CELL IS THE SOURCE
Line_5801	IT PROVIDES THE ELECTRICITY PRITY MUCH
Line_5802	WIRES PLOW THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5803	I THINK IT'S LIKE IT RECHEIVES ALL THE ENERGY OR ELI OR ELECTRICITY PRITY MUCH I THINK
Line_5804	WELL IT'S SPINNING BECAUSE THE D CELL IS GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY IN THE MOTOR
Line_5805	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE METAL THE METALS TOUCHING THE WIRE PUTTY O SO YEAH
Line_5806	THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_5807	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR IS SPINNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS SPINNING
Line_5808	WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE MOTOR
Line_5809	BOTTUM IT'S PRITTY IT'S A LIGHT BULB I MEAN UH D CELL BATTERY OR A BATTERY ON THE TOP IT'S A LIGHT BULB
Line_5810	WITCH I THINK I THINK THAT'S LIKE A SWITCH
Line_5811	THE ELECTRI THE ELECTRO MAGNET IS PICKING UP UH WHOLE VENTROM MAGNETS
Line_5812	THE LESS WRAPS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5813	IT GEPS STRONGER AND IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5814	IT GETS MORE MAGNET UM IT PICKS UP MORE MAGNETS
Line_5815	IT PICKS UP MORE UM WASHERS
Line_5816	WELL UM THE STRENGTH IS GETTING WELL UM IT GETS STRONGER
Line_5817	YOU COULDN WRAP A WIRE ABROUNT IT
Line_5818	CAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
Line_5819	UM THAT IT GETS STRONGER EVERY TIME THEE'S MORE WIRES
Line_5820	IYBE LIKE TWENTY UM NOT TO SHURE BUT
Line_5821	WELL I M WENT TO WERE THE NINTY FIVE WOULD BE ON THE GRAS AND THEN I WENT OVER AND IT LOOKED LIKE OOD BE OND FIFTEEN
Line_5822	THERES U THINGS THAT TICK TO MAGNET I THINK
Line_5823	WELL SINCE THE PAPER CLIP S STEEL IT'S PRITY IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR MOVE
Line_5824	MOST OF THEM ARE MADE FROM STEEL SOME OF THEM ARE ALUMINIUM THOUGH
Line_5825	STEEL AND ALUMINIUM
Line_5826	TEY'RE ALL NOT STEEL ARE ALCOMING ONE
Line_5827	AND SLITORS ARE LIKE UM SPUNGES ROCKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5828	IN CILOWITORS ARE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT STEEL
Line_5829	ELL ALES WELL STEEL UM CAN GET PICKED UP BY A MAGNET  ALUMINIUM IT CANT
Line_5830	THEY'RE ALL TEEL
Line_5831	HI MARNEY MY NAME IS NICKALLINE HOW ARE YOU DOING DOO KNOW WHAT THE DAY IS
Line_5832	WE'VE BEEN TESTING MAGNETS ON DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY STICK OR NOT
Line_5833	THEY  UM THROUGH ALL EITHER STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CONTAINES IRON OR IRON
Line_5834	ONE NAIL IS NOT IRON OR STEEL
Line_5835	BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO UM IRON OR STEEL UM ONE OF THEM WASN'T MADE OF IRON OR STEEL SO IT DON'T STICK
Line_5836	THE MAGNETIC FORCE CAN KIN  GENERATE AROUND LIKE IRON OR STEEL AND THEN GIVE IT THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO STICKX TO OTHER THINGS
Line_5837	EY CAN GO THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE THIM STICK TOGETHER
Line_5838	ONE OF THE MAGNETS IS GENERATING MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE TABLE SO IT'S MAKING IT STICK
Line_5839	I'M NOTSHURE HOW IT DOESNT BUT MAGNETS CAN JUST SOME HOW AGENERATE MAGNETIC FORSE THROUGH OBJECTS TO MAKE ANOTHER MAGNET STICK
Line_5840	U  THE THICKNESS REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT'S TO THICK THEN MAGNETIC FORSE WON'T GO THROUGH IT
Line_5841	UM THAT' ALL THE MAGNETIC DOMAINS INSIDE ARE ALL FACING THE SAME WAY AND IT'S PRTY MUCH INTO MTURNED IN PRETY MUCH TURNED INTO A MAGNET
Line_5842	UM THEN IT FOR THE MAGNEKG NET FIELD AROUND IT AND IT MADES THE PAPER CLIP STICK
Line_5843	THE MAGNET HADDN'T BEEN WR TO CHARGE THE NAIL AND PUT A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO I DIDN'T STIR TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5844	BECAUSE THE  MAGNET CHARO CENTNAIL N PUT A MAGNETIC FILED AROUND IT UM SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5845	A CIRCUIT IS A WAIGH FOR  ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL AND IT MAKES SOME KIND OF CIRCLE FORM
Line_5846	UM ELECTRICITY TRAVE A CIRCUIT IS THE WAIGHT TO LET ELECTRICITY TRAVEL
Line_5847	IT'S FORMING A CIRCLE
Line_5848	IT HAS TO GO FROM THE MINEUS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE PLAS SIDE
Line_5849	ONE HAS UMORE THINGS IN IT THE OTHER ONE GUESSES A BASULAIT BULB CIRCUIT
Line_5850	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE COMPLEX AND THE ONE ON THE LEFTER IS JUST BASICAL
Line_5851	IT'S GOING FROM THE MINA SIDE UP INTO THE LIGHT BULLB DOWN AND THEN UP INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULLB AND THEN DOWN AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND UT CUST CEEPS CIRCLING
Line_5852	IT SHOWS LIKE HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_5853	AND TWO THWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_5854	IT GOES AROUND INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BUB INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BUMB UM OUT OF THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE BATTERY W GETS HEETS CIRCLING
Line_5855	I'VE ARRADY SAID ENOUGH ABOUT FLOW
Line_5856	UM THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE BRINGS IT IN
Line_5857	NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU TURN IT U THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALWAYS GOING TO PUT THE ELECTRICITY OUT IN THE PLUS SIDE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING IT IN
Line_5858	U THE THE LITTLE BLU DOTS ARE STILL GOING IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5859	THE NEGATIVE SIDE UM YOU SEE THE LITTLE BLU DOTS COMING OUT OFE
Line_5860	IN SITTING INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A WIRE IS JUST GOING INTO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEN OUT AGAIN
Line_5861	TWO BATTERIES HAS MORE POWER THAN ONE SO THE LIGHT BULBS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
Line_5862	I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME SO BIE
Line_5863	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH  THE CUP SL THE'RE STICKING TOGETHER
Line_5864	THE LEGBACK SURELY I BREAKS THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS THE WEIGHT FROM THE WASHERS
Line_5865	IT'S MOVING THE BACK IT'S MOVING THE MAGNETS FARTHER APART
Line_5866	THMAGNETIC FORS ITS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM AT THE CUP SO THEY CAN STICK BUT IT'S DCREET BUT MAY MAGNETIC FORSES DCREASING WHEN THE SPACERS ARE PUT BETWEEN THEM
Line_5867	YOU SHOULD ALWAUSE EITHER HALF LIKE A MAGNET MAGNETS TOGETHER AND WASHERS
Line_5868	MAYBE GRICEE USED DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WE'RE IN A STRONG
Line_5869	WE WERE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY WE TALKED A LITTLE ABA A LITTLE ABIT ABOUT ANIMALS THAT USED ECTRICITY TO FIND FOOD AND KEEPE  PRESANCE AWAY
Line_5870	IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BOTH BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE UM BOTH PARALLEL TO RINA PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER
Line_5871	NO MATTER WHICH WAY THE BATTERY IS TURNED UM IT'LL ELLECRICY ALWAYS GO OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ALWAYS GO IN UM TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5872	THE FLOW IS GOING UP BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BATTERY AROUND AND THEN THE FLOW WILL BE GOING DOWN
Line_5873	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEEVES THE  ELECTRICITY AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUTS IT OUT
Line_5874	THE NEGATIVE SIDE PUT IT OUT
Line_5875	THE MINE SIDE IS PUTING THE ELECTRICITY OUT THEN ITS KILING UP INTO LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_5876	HERE ARE FOR PATHWAYS TWO FOR EACH
Line_5877	EVERYWEARE ON THE LIGHT BULB HOULDER IT'S GREEN THOUGH ELECTRICITY FLOWS ALL THROUGH IT
Line_5878	THE CIRCLE AT THE LOPS ARE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LITTLE THE PLAINE  LINES ARE
Line_5879	EVERYTHING IN IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN A CIRCUIT
Line_5880	IT SHOWES YOU THAT THERE IS TWO LIGHT WALBS AND IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5881	WE MADE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5882	WELL SINCE IT'S A ELECTRO MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR IT TO BE B TO PICK MAGNETIC THINGS UP
Line_5883	YOU HAVE TO WRAP THE WIRE AWROUND OR ELSE IT WON'T WREALLY WORK
Line_5884	THE WIRE IS RAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_5885	THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS COMPLETLY FLOWING THROUGH
Line_5886	U IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN IT IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE CIRCUIT TO WORK
Line_5887	IT HAS TO BE IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND IT HAS TO BE A CLOSED CIRCUIT FROM THE MAGNET TO WORK
Line_5888	UMTHE WASHERS WILL START STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_5889	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE RIVET TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5890	IT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK
Line_5891	THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED FOR IT TO WORK AND IF THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_5892	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH UM PROPERLY BUT IF IT'S NOT  THEN THE ELECTRO MAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5893	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5894	A TEMPORY MAGNET DOESN'T MEANS IT'S NOT A MAGNET FOREVER SO SOME ELECTROMAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS A MAGNET
Line_5895	UM SO MAG THAT SOME MAGNETS NEED ELECTRICITY TO WORK BECAUSE THE'RE ONLY ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_5896	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED IT LETS THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND MAKE ATHE
Line_5897	IRON OR STEEL
Line_5898	THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY TIPE THAT WORKS AS A NORMAL MAGNET THAT WILL STICK LIKE A NORMAL MAGNET
Line_5899	IT KIND OF PUTS THE A ENERGY OUT INTO THE WIRES SO IT'S PRITY MUCH LIKE THE SOURCE OF IT
Line_5900	UM THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE UM OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY CAN TRAVEL THROUGH
Line_5901	THEY LET THE ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH IT SO IT CAN LIKE GO TO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT TO GO TO
Line_5902	THEY LET THE UM ELECTRICCITY KIND FROW THROUGH SO THEY KIND T LIKE THE PAT UP THE LITTLE PATHWAY
Line_5903	IT'S A KIND OF WHAT THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO BECAUSE THAT'S KOND OF WA NEEDS ELECTRICITY SO
Line_5904	U A RECEIVER MEANS THAT YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_5905	IT USES THE ELECTRICITY TO START RUNNING
Line_5906	IT'S RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND IT'S RUNNING
Line_5907	WHENCSE THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING METAL IT THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_5908	IT'S TOUCHING METAL AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5909	IT'S TOUCHING TO THE BATTAL
Line_5910	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH AND MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_5911	MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCLE
Line_5912	IT'S GOING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE MOTOR OUT OF THE MOTOR AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_5913	EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EITHER LIKE TOUCHING A BATTERY OR METAL
Line_5914	THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES FLOWING TO THE LITTLE CIRCLE WITH THE THING IN IT
Line_5915	THE CIRCLE WITH ALUPMINET IS A LIGHT BULB
Line_5916	A BATTERY ONE SIDE IS THE PLUS  ONE LINE IS THE PLUS SIDE THE OTHER SIDE I THE MINEAS SIDE
Line_5917	HERE IS A BATTERY A MOTOR AND TWO WIRONS
Line_5918	IT'S THE MOTOR UM THE UM IS PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE MOTORS STICKE TO THEM
Line_5919	THE LITTALE LIGNE IS A DOD ON THE END IS A SWITCH
Line_5920	IT SHOWES YOU A WAY TO SET UP THE CIRCUIT
Line_5921	HEY'RE MAGNETS LIKE USE ELECTRICITY TO WORK AS MAGNETS
Line_5922	ION OR STEEL
Line_5923	IT HAS TO BE A COMPLEETE CLOSED CIRCUIT FOR THE ELECTRO MAGNET TO WORK
Line_5924	A CLOSED CIRCUIT LETS ELECTRICITY FLOW BUT AN OPEN CIRCUIT DOESN'T
Line_5925	THE MORE WINES YOU PUT ON THE RIVET THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS
Line_5926	IF YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED WINES IT SUPERSTRONG SO YU CAN PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIKE FIVE IT COULD ONLY PICK UP LIKE TWO OR THREE
Line_5927	IT HAS MORELECTRICITY SO IT MAKES THE MATHE ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5928	THE MORE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE REVET THE STRONGER IT IS
Line_5929	THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT CAN PICK UP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE M M FOR STUFF
Line_5930	UM HOW MUCH CHARGED THE BATTERY HAS AND HOW CLEIF AND THE SWITCH
Line_5931	MORE WINES GIVES IT MORE MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS SO IF IT HAS MORE WINES IT CAN PICK UP MORE WASHERS
Line_5932	UM YOU COUN WIND IT MORE
Line_5933	THE MORE WINES THE MORE WASHERS THIT CAN PICK UP
Line_5934	IT GETS MORE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN GET
Line_5935	PROBABLY IN A BARGRAM LIKE YOU WULD HAVE TEN WINES THREE WASHERS TWENTY WINES FIVE WASHERS AND IT KEEPS YOWING UP
Line_5936	THE NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP
Line_5937	THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE STRONGER THE MAGNET GETS
Line_5938	IF IT DOESN'T PICK UP VERY MANY THEN THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY RAPS BUT IF IT PICKS UP A LOT THEN  HAS A LOT OF RAPS
Line_5939	WELL MANDY GOT FIFTEEN AND HALF OF TEN IS FIVE AND TEN ONLY GOT THREE
Line_5940	THAT THINGS ON THE LEFT TO THE WIRES ER THE SWITCH MAYBE TO SEE IF IT'L MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON
Line_5941	CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT LET ELECTRICITY THROUGH THROUGH THEM BECAUSE THEY CONDUCT ID KIND OF
Line_5942	THE CONDUCTORS WERE PRITY MUCH ALL METAL THINGS AND THEY LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEM
Line_5943	WHAT'S EVER IN THE CIRCUIT LIKE THE LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR WILL TURN ON
Line_5944	YOU CLOSED THE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF TUCHING THE SWITCH TO METAL UM YOU PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF METAL ON IT THINK TO CLOSE IT
Line_5945	IT CAN LY CLOSE A CIRCUIT AND LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH
Line_5946	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THROW THROUGH THEY DON'T CLOSE THE CIRCUITS SO NOTHING WILL TURN ON
Line_5947	CONDUCTORS LET THE  CIRCUIT TURN ON BUT INSULATORS DON'T
Line_5948	THE MOTOR STAND STILL BECAUSE INSOLITARS ARE NOT ALWAYS MADE OF METAL
Line_5949	INSULATORS ARE NOT REALLY MADE OF METAL STRAWS WOOD ROCKS AND LIKE SPUNCHES AND NONE OF THEM ARE MADE OF METAL
Line_5950	THEY DON'T CLOSE A CIRCUIT SO THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON
Line_5951	THEY'RE PRITY MUCH LIKE THE OPPOSIT OF CONDUCTORS UM THEY CANT CLOSE A CIRCUIT BECAUSE TEY'RE NOT METAL USUALLY
Line_5952	IRON AND STEEL WHICH ARE BOTH METAL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_5953	EI'RE PULSI OR IRON OR STEEL
Line_5954	UH MY NAME IS KEATHANAMOSOM
Line_5955	MAGNET TS A MAGNET MAGNET ATTRACTS IRON
Line_5956	BECAUSE IN OUR CLASSROUM WE WERE DOIN WEL DORING MAGNETISM AND I TOT YOUR SAYD THAT
Line_5957	A REPEL AND A TRAC
Line_5958	WELL THE END AND THE END BOUNDSE OFF AND THE END AND THE ES COME TOGETHER AND THE ESS AND THE END COME TOGETHER BUT THE ESS AND THE ESS BOUNDS OF
Line_5959	O CLIAUM DON
Line_5960	WELL THEY HAVE TO BE ATTATCHED TO THE BRATS AND THE BRAS HAVE TO BE ATTATCHED ANOTHER WIRE UNDER UM UNDER THE BORD
Line_5961	THEY THEY ARE CALLED BRANS OR COMPONENTS ARMING CONDUCTORS
Line_5962	IF IF THE BRANS WEREN'T METAL THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT IT IT WOULD JUST IT WOULDN'T JUST GO THROUGH IT AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T
Line_5963	UH WELL THE WIRE UNDERNEEATH THE BANS UM MAKES THE IT MAKES IT A WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_5964	BECAUSE THE IRON BECAUSE THE IRON AND THEM UM ATTRACTS TO EACH OTHER
Line_5965	IT IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPELL WHEN THEY ARATTRACED
Line_5966	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE REALLY STRONG AND THEY CAN GO THROUGH REALLY THICK UM THINGS
Line_5967	WELL IF IT GOES THROUGH THINGS THAT MEANS THAE MAGNET RELLY STRONG
Line_5968	UM A TABLE UM UM A WASHER
Line_5969	WELL THE THICKNESS IS LIKE
Line_5970	OUT WE'RE ALL THE MAGNETIC UM WE'RE THE MAGNET IS MAKING UM THEN NAIL
Line_5971	IT NOS ME THAT THERE'S MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE UM NAIL SO THAT IT WILL ATTRACT TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5972	YOU HAVE TO UM SLIDE THE MAGNET ACCROSS THE UM NAIL SO  IT WOULD MAKE A A MAGNETIC FIELD TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5973	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS ALL ABOUT  KAY I DON'T KNOWTICE THE WEIGHT
Line_5974	WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE IT HAS WIRES AND IT ON THE IT WELL IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT BECAUSE
Line_5975	ELECTRICITY S A TRAVEL FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE
Line_5976	UM BECAUSE ONE THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHT BULB UM AND TWO WIRES AND THE OTHER THERE IS THREE WIRES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5977	'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5978	WELL IT FLOWS POARDS THE POSITIVE AND FLOWS OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5979	ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_5980	WELL OUT AND AR I DON'T DO
Line_5981	WELL IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T UM BE LIT AS MUCH
Line_5982	WELL IF THERE IF THERE WASN'T TWO BATTERIES TH LIGHT BULBS WOULDN'T BE AS LAIT
Line_5983	WELL THE ENERGY UM FLOWS THROUGH UM BOTH BATTERIES AND GETS MORE POWER TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS MORE
Line_5984	UM THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE LIT MORE AND THE ONE WAS ONE BATTERY WOOD UM BE LIT LESS
Line_5985	UM THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES IS LIGHT UHM MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS A LOT MORE RIGHT AND THEN THE ONE WITH ONE BATTERY MAKES LIGHT BULBS UM DM
Line_5986	IF YOU DIDDN'T ADD MORE UM ANOTHER BATTERY OR MORE POWER AN THE LIGHT BULBS WOULD BE STILL DIM
Line_5987	UM THE ENERGY UMS MORE PIS MORE POWERED AND IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB ON THE LIGHT MORE
Line_5988	WHEN YOU HAVE A D CELL TO A SERIES CIRCUIT UM IT'S WHEN
Line_5989	WELL WHEN YOU ADD A D CELL TO SERIUS CIRCUIT IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT MORE
Line_5990	WELL HERE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES AND WIRES CONNECTING TO THEM
Line_5991	UMWERL ES STUDYING ELECTRICITY
Line_5992	HERE IS TWO PUM PATHWAYS ON THIS PARALLES CIRCUIT ON THE RIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_5993	UM I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER IT
Line_5994	THE BLU DOTS AS THE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING REALLY FASTER THE LIGHT BULB  POWER THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5995	GOING INTO THE BATTERY AT THE UMPOSITIVE SIDE AN THEN GETTING RE CHARGED AND GOING BACK THROUGHTHE NEGATIVE SIDES AND POWERING LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
Line_5996	UM THERE IS TWO UM LIGHT BULBS BOTH POWER THE LOGHT AND TWO FOR UM WIRES AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5997	T'S UM IT'S SHOWING TWO LIGHT BULBS FOR WIRES AND  A BATTERY OF A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5998	THE MIDDLE ASEMBLE UM REPROSENTS A BATTERY
Line_5999	ENTS U PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6000	WS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UM THAT'S LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB
Line_6001	RKIT MEANS THAT THE UM WIRES ARE NEVER TOUCHING AND THEY'RE JUST GOING  ON AND THEY NEVER TOUCH
Line_6002	IT TELLMS ME THAT THE THAT THE BATTERY CHARGES BOTH LIGHT BULBS AND IT'S IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_6003	HAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
Line_6004	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_6005	MEANS IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT SO ELECTRICITY WILL TRAVEL THROUGH IT
Line_6006	UM WELL IT'S IMPORTANT REI
Line_6007	CH IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT CAN TURN OFF THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OR ON THE HOL CIRCUIT
Line_6008	HOLL NO IDH
Line_6009	UM WAL
Line_6010	T IT MAKES ME SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT UM AND I WAS PUTTING IT AGAINST THE WASHERS THATIT WASN'T PICKING IT UP AT ANY WASHERS
Line_6011	WELL THE THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET SO THAT THE RIVE CAN  PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6012	IT HAS TO BE WAINED FROM LIKE STEEL OR IRON
Line_6013	WE WENT UM WE WRAPED IT ABOUND FIVE AND THEN TEN TIMES AND THEN FIFTEEN AND THEN TWENTY AND THEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN THIRTY
Line_6014	IF YOU IT SHOWES THAT THAT IF YOU YOU WRAPED IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MEANS IT PICKS UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_6015	MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM THAT YOU WRAP THE WIRE UM A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE RIVET
Line_6016	WELL ITS IT GETS MORE STREANGTH BY IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND IF YOU WRAP IF YOU RAP THE WRIRES AROUND IT MORE
Line_6017	IF IT PICKS BOR WASHERS SUMMINCE IT AN ELECTROMAGNET IS STRONGER
Line_6018	BY WRAPPING THEUM THE WIRE AWROUNTD THE RIVET LIKE MORE
Line_6019	WELL THE MORE YOU WINED IT AROUND THE RIM UM THE MORE YOU WIND THE WIRES AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6020	IF IF YOU KEEP RAPPING IT AROUNTD MORE AROUND THE VERVIT THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
Line_6021	IT'S STRONGER THAN A WASHER THAT PICKS UP A FEO WASH M WASHERS
Line_6022	IT GETS STRONGER BECAUSE U MOREALELECTRICITY IS GOING AROUND IT SO IT GETS STRONGER AND  IT CAN PICK UP MORE
Line_6023	WELL IT SHOWES THAT WHEN I INCREACE THE NUMBER OF RAPS THE MORE WASHERS I GUET SO
Line_6024	UH YEAH
Line_6025	UM WELL THE NUMBER WRAPS GETS HIRED TO LIKE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FORT FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY NINTY HUNDRED
Line_6026	NUMBER RAPS GETS LARGER THE THE HIRE THE LITTLE GREEN DOUTHS GO AND THE HIRE THE UM THE GREEN LIN GO
Line_6027	THE WASHERS ARE GETTING SO THAT MEANS YOU GET MORE WASHERS AND MORE RAPS
Line_6028	WELL INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT UM THAT IF YOU PUT ATTATCH THEM TO THE WIRES THE LECTRICITY WON'T THROW THROUGH HIM AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6029	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH THE UM ROCK OR THE SPUNGE AND THE MOTOR WON'T SPIN
Line_6030	IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING IF YOU PUT A CONDUCTOR ATTATCH TO THE WIRE ATHE MOTOR WILL START SPINNING
Line_6031	LL THE SHRALWL IS MADE OF PLASTICK SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AND IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_6032	THEY ARE ALL CONDUCTORS AND THEY ALL STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6033	STEEL METAL ALUMINIUM ANYTHING THAT CAN STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_6034	WELL METAL HAS IRON IN IT AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IRON AN CERTAIN THINGS TO STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_6035	YES MARNEY YOU DID REPREATE YOURSELF AND YOU DIDN'T FOR A GOOD CHAUP
Line_6036	I'VE BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME
Line_6037	SOME OF THEM WILL STICK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM WON'T
Line_6038	VERY WELL IN HAVING SO MUCH FUN HOW MUCE YOU
Line_6039	WELL THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BORDS AND THEY HAVE BRAWDS AND THEY HAVE A WIRE THROUGH THERE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WIRE IS TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_6040	WELL IF THERE IS NO WIRE BEHIND THE BORD THEN THE LIGHT BULB OR THE MOTOR WOULD NEVER LIGHT UP
Line_6041	WELL THERE HAS TO BE A WIRE RUNNING FROM EACH END TO THE BRAT
Line_6042	WELL THEY'RE EASY TO PUT YOUR WIRE TO AND THE METAL
Line_6043	WELL METAL WELL ELECTRICITY CAN RUN THROUGH METAL AND THIS CASE IT IS METAL AND UM SO IT JUST THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROGHTHE BRA AND YEAH
Line_6044	WELL BEHIND EACH BRAB THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED
Line_6045	IT TELLS ME THAT BEHIND  AND B BRAS ARE CONNECTED TO A SMALL WIRE THAT I COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT
Line_6046	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HEANG ON
Line_6047	I THINK IT TO FORCE THE MAGNET UM I'M PRETY SURE THAT IT'S THE FORTSE JUST BECAUSE I GUESSE
Line_6048	WELL A SORT OF DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS IS DOING
Line_6049	A I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE NAIL IS ACTING US A TEMPROREARY MAGNET
Line_6050	AH YOU HAVE TO RUB IT ON TOP THE NAIL OR  STICK IT ON THE END FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THE MAGNET FIELD CAN GO ALL THEWAY THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_6051	THE NAIL IS ACTING AS A TEMPLE RERU MAGNET
Line_6052	OH LET SO WEIGH HANG ON
Line_6053	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON  WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND UM TRINAL LIGHT TWO LIGHT BULBS YEAH
Line_6054	WELL THE ELECTRICITY GOES SORT OF ON A PATHWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AN THE LIKE BUB AND BACK OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_6055	WELL ONE OF THEM IS POWERING TWO BATTERIES I MEAN TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6056	WELL THIT'S ON HAVE TO SHAR THE ELECTRICITY SO ONE THEM SO THEY BOTH GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER SO THEY CAN BOTH GET LIGHT UP
Line_6057	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE IN THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_6058	WE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6059	WELL THE BLUDD SOR SHOW ELECTRICITY I GUESS
Line_6060	WELL OF COURSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS A  FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE O THE BATTERY IND TO THE POSISIDES BATTERY
Line_6061	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH BOTH BATTERYS AND THEN THROUGH BOTH LIGHT BULBS
Line_6062	WELL WELL THE IT'S GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY BACK INTO THEPOSITIVE SIDE
Line_6063	WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK OUT INT INTO THE POSTIVE
Line_6064	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_6065	UM THEA T END THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TWARD THE POSIVE SIDE OF THEBATTERY
Line_6066	IT REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE WAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6067	WELL IT WORKS BOTH WAIGHTS IT JUST REVERSES THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
Line_6068	WELL SLOW IT'S THE WAIY IT'S LIKE A PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH
Line_6069	WELL IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP A LOT MORE
Line_6070	WELL IT DEFINEMALLY DOES LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB A LOT MORE
Line_6071	THERE IS MORE UM ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY WHICH MEANS IT FLOWS FASTER
Line_6072	HEY LIT UP THEY THEY LIT UP UM A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_6073	THEYK IT A LOT BOTH LIGHT BULBS GET A LOGHT BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THE OME BATTERY SO THEY EACH GIT POWER THE SAME
Line_6074	WELL WHENE THERE TWO BATTERIES THEY WLL THEY LIGHT UP A LO BRIGHTER AND WHENE THERE'S ONLY ONE THEY DON'T LIGHT UP AS MUCH
Line_6075	YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE ARE TOUCHING AND IF YOU HAVE THE NEGATIVE ATHE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL WORK
Line_6076	MARNEY HAVE AREADY TOLD YOU THAT
Line_6077	ONE THEY GET FASTER
Line_6078	THEY GET UM THE ELECTRICITY GETS FASTER
Line_6079	VERY GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_6080	UM THE FOR IT GETS WEAKER
Line_6081	THE FOURCES  UM STRONGER
Line_6082	WELL WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE PUT WASHERS INTO CUP AY
Line_6083	THERE RUM WHATS IT CALLED THERE ARE LIKE CHIPS THE CHIPS ARE BETWEEN AN IT UM SO IT IT WEACENS THE FORCE
Line_6084	UM ADDING SPACTURES BETWEEN THE MAGNET UM WEAKENS THE FORCE YOU NOW OF THE MAGNETS
Line_6085	THE DISTANCE GETS THEIR FARTHER APART WHICH MEANS IT WEAKENS THEIR FOURCE
Line_6086	DON'T YOU MEAN  B EM D
Line_6087	B AND D GOT THE SAME  AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE THEY DID THE SAME PERCEGERS BUT GROUP S DIDN'T
Line_6088	A ONDERFUL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6089	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MAKING ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_6090	WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T FAM THAT
Line_6091	IT UST WRAPS VERY NEATLY
Line_6092	IT'S CALLED A STEEL RIVEITS
Line_6093	UM SO SO THE WIRE CAN FLOW THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_6094	WELL THERE ARE WASHERS DOWN THERE AND IT SORT OF AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT ACTS LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE TE ELECTRICITY
Line_6095	WELL YOU NEED TO THINK WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGAL PART IF THERE'S NOT ONE PART THEN THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK
Line_6096	WE NEED A RAPPED AROUND THE THE RIVET VERY VERY LIKE PROSIZE
Line_6097	THE WASHERS COME UP AND LIKE UM CONNECT TO THE RIVET
Line_6098	ORY NOW IT'S UM LIGHT CLOSED
Line_6099	WELL IT JUST IT WHATEVER THE ELECTRO MAGNIC HAD PICKED UP IT DROPS
Line_6100	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND THE WASHERS GO UP ONTO THE RIVET
Line_6101	THEN THE WASHERS GO BACK UP UNTO THE RIVETS
Line_6102	WELL WITH OUT THE ELECTRICITY THE ELECTROMAGNET WOULD JUST BE A PLAIN REVET BUT YOU NEED THE ELECTRICITY TO GO IN TO THE RIVET AND PICK UP THOSE WASHERS
Line_6103	BECAUSE THEM
Line_6104	UM PHE RIVETOR COR HAS BEEN MADE FROM IRON TO BE AN TEPOR MAGNET
Line_6105	WELL THAT YOU IT JUST NEEDS TO BE RAPTRON SOMETHING MADE IRON TO BE A TEMPOR MAGNET FY RAPPARAM SOMETHING LIKE LESSY MADE A PLASTICK THAT THING WILL HAPPEN
Line_6106	UVERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_6107	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_6108	YOU NEED A SWITCH A MOTOR A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_6109	THE BATTERY IS THE SOURCE AND THE SOURCE GIVES H ELECTRICITY TOTO JUST SEND THE ELECTRICITY DOWN TO WHATEVER IT'S PHOSTD TO DO
Line_6110	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE POGT FROM THE THE NEGATIVE END OF THE D CELL BACK TO THE POSITIVE
Line_6111	WELL A MOTOR IS WHAT A MOTOR COULD BE THE RECEIVER IT COULD BE UM THE MOTOR COULD BE A RECEIVER IT IS THE RECEIVER
Line_6112	A RECEIVE RSOM AND TH A RECEIVER IS THE THING THAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6113	MARNEY I DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_6114	THE MOTOR IS UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_6115	EVERYTHING HAVS TO BE EVERY WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED
Line_6116	THE SIMBLES UM THE LIGNE WITH THE LONGER LIGNE THE SHORT LINE THE LONG LINE REPROSENTS THE BATTERY AND THE CIRCLE WITH THE ITTLE LOOP IN THE MIDDLE IS THE LIGHTBULE
Line_6117	THE EUM IS FOR THE MOTOR
Line_6118	WE'RE MAKE ING UM UP UM I AND O A CLOSED CIRCUITS
Line_6119	ISN'T A WASHER CONDUCTOR TWO
Line_6120	INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND THEY BLOCK ELECTRICITY FROM COMING THROUGH
Line_6121	INSULATORS DON'T LET ELECTRICITY THRILL FLOW THROUGH THEM AND CONDUCTORS DO
Line_6122	WELL ONLY METAL ONES WORK ONL
Line_6123	UM I WAS TALKING
Line_6124	THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR I MEAN OPEN WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR
Line_6125	IT'S CLOSED
Line_6126	WELL YOU CAN MAKE METAL TO IA TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_6127	IS IT UM IT HAS TO BE UM LIKE STEEL
Line_6128	THEY ALL HAVE TO BE UM STEEL METAL
Line_6129	I HAVE IT TO WORK
Line_6130	YES I DO GET THAT MARNEY
Line_6131	ES I AM READY
Line_6132	WEL WE HAVE BEN STUDYIN ABOUT THE SUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6133	WE HAVE OBSERVED HOW IT CONNECTS TO THINGS AND HOW IT CAN STICK TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETICK
Line_6134	UM CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
Line_6135	THEY CONNECT TO THINGS THAT ARE MAGNETIC AND THAT HAVE IRON IN THEM MOST OF THE TIME
Line_6136	AND THAT'S WHY  UM I DIDN'T CONNECT
Line_6137	BUT THEN THE BOTTOME OMES WERE CONNECTING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALUMINIUM IN THEM
Line_6138	THEY ARE CLICKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT WORKING
Line_6139	PUSHED AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALUMINIUM AND NOT IRON LIKE THE OTHER ONES
Line_6140	THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN THEM BUT THEN THE TWO IN THE MIDDL DON'T HAVE ANY THING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ALUMINUG
Line_6141	BY NICE MEATING YEAH U BIE
Line_6142	E DON'T WANO GET BRN
Line_6143	AR MADE OUT OF METAL
Line_6144	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT ELECTRICITY FLOWS FLOWS THROUGH METAL
Line_6145	WHERE HAM HAWS TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE TO GET A SWITCH
Line_6146	T LIGHTS THE BULB UP IF IT LIGHTS THE BULB UP IT MAKES ELECTRICITY AND YES
Line_6147	BUH WE NEED TO GO BIE
Line_6148	HALLOW
Line_6149	E JUST PULLED ON JUST ONE IN IT
Line_6150	BUT WHEN YOU LET GO OFE THE MAGNET WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS EVERYTHING WILL FALL AND THAT THE PAPER CLIP WON'T BE CONNECTED TO THE NAIL BUT THE NAILL  WILL BE CONNECTED
Line_6151	WHEN THE MAGNET IS IS ON THE NAIL IT PICKS UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN WHEN YOU LE GO UP THE MAGNET IT LE GOES
Line_6152	THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A TEMPOR RARY MAGNET
Line_6153	UM THEN ALL HAFFEND WAS
Line_6154	WEIGHT SO W
Line_6155	WE'VE BEEN DOING PATHWAYS AND ELECTRICITY ITCE
Line_6156	UM IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT FLOWS IT'S THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6157	A CIRCUIT IS WHERE IT GOES ALL WRIGHT THROUGH AND HOW COOD BURON IT AND SO I DON'T
Line_6158	UM THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH IS MAKING THE LIGHT BUB LIGHT UP
Line_6159	IT CIRCLES AROUND THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WOR ES SA
Line_6160	THE BATTERY HAS TO BE POSITIVE SO MAGNET
Line_6161	UM THE FIRST PIXTURE THEN ON THE SECOND PIXTURE THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_6162	THEY CAM PARL BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BOTH LIGHTING UP
Line_6163	UM ONE HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND ONE THAT HAS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WHICH BUT THEN THEY'RE THEY'RE POINTING THE SAME WAY SO THET'S CAUSING IT TO KNOW
Line_6164	IT'S DIMMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FOL FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_6165	IT I IT DOESN COMPARE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH LIGHTING UP BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE BECAUSE ONE'S DIN AND ONE'S FOULLY WELL
Line_6166	WELL THE BLU DODS KEEP GOING AND GOING UNTILL THEY STOP WHEN YOU JUST CONNECT THE WIRES
Line_6167	ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BUL WELL
Line_6168	T'S IT LIVE TO NEGATIVE YAH
Line_6169	UM IT'S FLOWING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SO THAT IT SHOWS ME THAT THERE THERE IS A FLOW BUT IF THERE IS NOT A FOUL HUNDRED THE LIGHT BUB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_6170	WHEN YOU SWITCH IT IT GOES ONE DIRECTION BUT THEN WHEN YOU SWITCHED IT LIKE THAT IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_6171	IT ALWAYS FLOWES U POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6172	SLOWING AWAY FROM THE POSITIVE
Line_6173	'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LIGHT BULBS BOTH LIGHT
Line_6174	IT WORKS LIKE IT DID BEFORE BUT JUST A LITTLE MORE POWER
Line_6175	I NOTICE THAT THEY WERE BOTH FLOWING THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_6176	THAT ACTUALLY ONE D CELL CAN BE
Line_6177	THEY'RE LIGNED UP THI SAME BUT THERE IS OU FLB BUT THE ELECTRICITY WHICH IS FLOWING THE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
Line_6178	WELL IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6179	IT MAKES IT HAVE MORE POWER AND LIGHT UP MORE
Line_6180	UM IT'S LIGHTS UP MORE BECAUSE OF THE THERE 'S MORE ELECTRICITY
Line_6181	IT'S TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHES
Line_6182	UM ELECTRICITY MOSTLY
Line_6183	I THICK IT OUT THAT'S UM
Line_6184	IT REPRSENTS TWO BATTERIES AND TWO SWITCHE
Line_6185	TALK TO ME ALL V
Line_6186	WE'VE BEEN GILLING WITH MAGNETS AND MAGNETISM
Line_6187	MA THERE WAS NINT TEEN WASHERS
Line_6188	THERE WEIGHT WHAT IS THE THING
Line_6189	WHAT'S HAPPNING IS THAT THE MAGNETS HAVE ENOUGH FORCE TO GET THROUGH ONE SPACER SO IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP B AND IT DOESN'T MOVE CUP A
Line_6190	THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACERS THAT IT TOOK THAT THE FORCE COULDN' STIK TOGETHER AND THEY WOULDN'T STICK SO
Line_6191	FIVE SPACERS NEEDED THREE THREE WASHERS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS ENOUGH
Line_6192	EY ARE GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_6193	JUDGES FOLLOW THE ROULS AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CANN DO WEGA
Line_6194	A B EN D GO NINETEEN WASHERES A THAT WAS ENOUGH IN THE OTHER PICTURES THAT YOU SHOWE ME TO DISCONNECT IT AND THEY DOIN'T HAVE ENOUGH FORSE
Line_6195	TOOK NINETEEN WASHERS AND A NINTI WASHERS AND B NAING GOUP DE TOOK NINETIE WASHERS AND THEN IN GROUPS SAYM FIVE
Line_6196	SPACERS AND THEN THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
Line_6197	A NINE TEEN BEAN NINE TEEN SE FIVE D NINE TEEN
Line_6198	IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE RIVIT CAN PICK UP
Line_6199	UM YOU MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE OF THE THE RIVET KIND OF HAS MOST OF THE ENERGY
Line_6200	IT MEANS THAT THERE IS MAGNETISM IN IT AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN IT
Line_6201	PROBABLY A WASHER  MAKE IT WORK BUT IT SOMETIMES WON'T
Line_6202	'M SORY WAEIT
Line_6203	UM WELL IT JUST KIND OF CONNECTS BECAUSE F THE FLOW UP THEY PROBABLY
Line_6204	LOW IS THE BIERLY WHAT IT DRESS IS DOING IF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OR IF IT DOES NOT
Line_6205	THAT ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S CLOSED THERE IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY SO FLOLING
Line_6206	IT HAS TO BE UM CLOSED FOR IT TO ATTRACT IT
Line_6207	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM
Line_6208	UM IT JHAINE ER BATTERY POWER WHEN THEY'RE USED TO MUCH AND IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP ITL OT BUT YET IT MANSORE THE THING YOU JUST MENTION TO MEAN
Line_6209	IT'S A D CELL BATTERY A LIGHT BULB STAND  WIRES AND A LITTLE STAND FOR EVERYTHING TO GO INTO
Line_6210	YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER AND THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN  LIKE AS IN THE BATTERY DID YE SOW
Line_6211	WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THIT RECHEIVES THE BATTERY AND THE POWER AND THEELECTRICITY AND
Line_6212	WHAT IT CAN DO IS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT GOES POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE
Line_6213	THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATATIVE IND TO THE BOTTOM AND TO THE SIDE
Line_6214	BUT AFTER THAT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING A ILL JUST STAY THERE AND YEAH
Line_6215	UM ELECTRICITY AND IT FFLOWES YEAT AND JUST FLOW IS IN STUFF
Line_6216	UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_6217	UM THE BATTERY HELPS THAT IN IT  MADE IT WORK
Line_6218	IT'S IMPORTANT SO THAT IT CAN FLOW TIS THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAIGT THAT IT FLOWS AND SO THAT THE LIGHT BUB CAN LIGHT UP
Line_6219	UM IT LIGHTS TO LIGHT BULBUM
Line_6220	UM ONE GOES TO THE SIDE AND ONE GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Line_6221	AND THEN NEGATIVE GIVFFS TO THE SIDE
Line_6222	LOST BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING FLOWING IT'S NOT CONNECTED
Line_6223	SO THE POSITIVE GOES T NEGATI
Line_6224	THE BUB IS CLOSED IT'S NOT OPEN
Line_6225	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONNECT STUFF TO MAE LIKE A SWITCH WORK AND MAKE THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_6226	SO THE SWITCH IS WHAT CONTAINES THE UM
Line_6227	UM EG LIKE BEHOOCKS THE LIGHT BULB UP
Line_6228	OP UM THE D CELL BATTERY UM CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BUMB TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP
Line_6229	THE D CELL MAKES IT LIGHT UP BECAUSE OF THE WIRES AND THEN THE MOTOR
Line_6230	UH ELECTRICITY
Line_6231	UM IT HELPS THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_6232	IT CARIES ELECTRICITY POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
Line_6233	IT CONNECTS AND THAT MAKES IT BOTH LIGHT UP AND THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6234	SORRY CAN YOU REPEETE THAT AGAIN
Line_6235	IT RECEIVES IT AND THEN SHIPS IT OFF TO KNE ORLENDS SORY
Line_6236	UM IT MAKES IT WORK WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT IT SHUTS EVERYTHING OFF WELL
Line_6237	LNHEO
Line_6238	IT'S MAKING EVERY THING GO CREASY
Line_6239	UM WHAT I'S HAPPENING AS IT'S CLOSED TO THAT IT'S MAKING THE FLAG GO THROUGH
Line_6240	IT'S LOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING AND COM FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_6241	WIRES TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
Line_6242	IT'S LETTING THE WIRES TOUCH THE MOTOR AND HELPING IT GO ON IN UF
Line_6243	T'S THE LIGHT BULB WE
Line_6244	IT'S POLLABWI DIDN'T WORK
Line_6245	WELL  WELL IT'S JUST A PATHWAY AND THEN THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH
Line_6246	M THE LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTING TO THE WIRE LWIES UM AND THERE IS A PATHWAY FOR LETTING IT GO THROUGH
Line_6247	A BATTERY A BATTERY THAT HAS A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
Line_6248	IT'S THE MOTOR
Line_6249	THOSE ARE THE WIRES CONNECTING
Line_6250	BATTERY AND MOTOR AND UM WHAT IN THIS
Line_6251	UH WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_6252	THEY VEARY VERY STRONG
Line_6253	THERE'S A RIVET AND WASHERS AND THE RAPETS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_6254	IRON
Line_6255	WASHERS AND THE RIVET
Line_6256	IT CLOSED
Line_6257	YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STRONG SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_6258	THAT THERE'S A WATTER WINES
Line_6259	FORTY THREE ILAMIE'S THAT THERE IS FORTY THREE WASHERS THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH
Line_6260	UM THE MORE WIRES YOU PUT IN PROBABLY
Line_6261	THE BATTERY PROBABLY LIKE THE POWEDE
Line_6262	IT PICS UP AR WASHE
Line_6263	UM YOU RAT IF YOU RAP
Line_6264	YOURE BATTERY PROBABLY YOU PROBLY WOULD NEED MORE OF THE POWER BUT THEN
Line_6265	IT IT LETS IT DOESN'T BRING UP A WA BUT IT USUALLY DOS BEAB
Line_6266	THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT A WATER PAER
Line_6267	THERE IS MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TH
Line_6268	BUBLE WRAS ONEGRAF WOULD BE GOOD PROBLY
Line_6269	ON THE SIDE OF THE DRALFT IT REPROESENTS HOW MANY WASHERS WERE PICKED UP
Line_6270	MORE WASHERS TO PICK UP
Line_6271	IT INCREASES BY TWO AND THEN UP TO ONE
Line_6272	IT GOES TWO FIFTEEN STELL BUT IT'S GOING SACSTRAN
Line_6273	AND I' I'D LIKE UM WHAT THEY DO HERE THEY MICK IT UP TO GO TO FIM CIEROW
Line_6274	THERE WAS A LOT OF STRENGTH
Line_6275	THIRTY THIRTY PROBABLEY
Line_6276	PROABLY TWENTY AR TWENTY FIVE
Line_6277	WE'VE BEEN DOING MAGNETISM AND SEEING UM WHAT COULD MAKE A MOTOR RUNE
Line_6278	UM WE IF WE TAKE AN AN ALUMINIUM NAIL IT ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE MOTOR WORK IF YOU CONNECT THE TWO WIRES TO IT
Line_6279	A CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL LET A MOTOR WORK
Line_6280	UM IT THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS MAKING IT WORK THE MOTOR IS RG
Line_6281	TALK TO ME WEIGHT
Line_6282	INSULATORS I STUFF THAT YOU NOT HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM AND THAT DON'T WORK
Line_6283	Y DON'T INSULATORS DON'T HAVE ANY THEY WON'T LET THE MOTOR WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IRON IN THEM
Line_6284	WHEN I CLICKED A SPUNGE THE MOTOR DIDN'T WORK IT JUST SAT THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE
Line_6285	THE MOTOR WON'T WORK THE INSULATOR SHOTS DOWN
Line_6286	METAL UM METAL CAN STICK TO IT
Line_6287	AND THE ALUMINIUM ONEON HAVE ANY METAL OR DIRON
Line_6288	A STEEL NAIL WILL CUE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND MA
Line_6289	MASS WEIGHT
Line_6290	IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
Line_6291	I DON'T UNDER STAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY AM SAI
Line_6292	THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CAPACITYES
Line_6293	UM YOU COULD THAT TO THE BREN MUH
Line_6294	YEAH TO FILL IT TO THE BRUM
Line_6295	YOU COULD TAKE A CIRRINGE AND PUR ONE WATER TO WATERLAN SOSO UNTILL YOU GET
Line_6296	I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT I DON'T
Line_6297	OU COULD TAKE A SERRENION TO IT A YES
Line_6298	MASS OF ACTUALLY VOLLIUTE OHAH
Line_6299	IT OPEN THE CAN UM AND SO THEY WHAN
Line_6300	IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLINI LITERS AND AT IN STIDY IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED
Line_6301	IT'S AS MUCH AS THE CANT CAN POSIBLY HO
Line_6302	IT'S THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOL
Line_6303	IT'S NOT PULLING AS MUCH AS IT LIT
Line_6304	THE VOLUM IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY
Line_6305	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLALITERS
Line_6306	THAI CAN REALLY ANSWER THAT WITH MY LEBLE OF KNOLEDGE NOT ASAYING LEUM DOEN BUT
Line_6307	VALOUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY HORT THAT'S WHAT I SAY IN THE PICTURE
Line_6308	CAPACITY IS HIER THAN THE VOLIOUME
Line_6309	THE MO IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE TE SERADEI HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
Line_6310	MEASURE MASS  THE CAPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLIUME
Line_6311	THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
Line_6312	THE TORPS ORH THE UNITSIDE
Line_6313	EVERY TEN MILLA LITERS
Line_6314	YOU COULD USE CIRVINCHES AND JUMEASURE THAT AT'S PROBABLY THE EASY
Line_6315	YOU COULD ESE THE SERENGE AND STUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD PULL IT OUT
Line_6316	IT STUCKS UP WATER AND THEN SPIC OUT WHEN YOU PUT POLE STUCKS INPUSH
Line_6317	IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY MILL
Line_6318	YOU COULD SCORDEN INTO A BEATER BEAKER NOT A BEATER
Line_6319	COULD FOLLOW IT UN THE BAKER
Line_6320	UH BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE SORRANGE WILLN'T EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE
Line_6321	YOU COULD FIGURE OUT  I FORGET WHAT IT WAS GOING TO SAY
Line_6322	UH YOU'RE WELCOME GOLD BYE
Line_6323	WELLWE HAD
Line_6324	CAPACITY IS THE MEASUREMENT HOW LONG SOM THE CA CAPACITY
Line_6325	HOW MUCH WATER SOMETHING IS AND THIS PECK TRAY HAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLIMETERS IT'S JUST A FAST PITION
Line_6326	I'M NOT SOURE
Line_6327	HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS IN THE CUP
Line_6328	WE TOOK SODA CANS TO SEE IF THES SODA COMPANY TALED THE TRITH ABOUT IT OR DIDN'T NOT TELL THE TRITH ABOUT IT
Line_6329	AND WE DIDN'T FILL OUR CDC CANDS ALLTHE AY TO THE TOP BECAUSE THE EM THY'RE NOT ALWAYS FILT ON THEWAY TO TOTH TOP IND SO YOU SHAKE THE BCAUSE YOU SHAKE THIS U  BFORE YOU OPEN IT
Line_6330	WE ESED WE LEFFT A LITTLE SPACE INSIDE AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER I READ OUT HOW MUCH WATER THAT WAS
Line_6331	MEANS THAT THERE'S THREE HUNDRED OUT THE MELLALITORS
Line_6332	IT COULD  WILL ACTUALLY HURT LMORE THAN IT SAS BECAUSE IT
Line_6333	I'M NOT SOR
Line_6334	OLH THE CAPACITY HAS
Line_6335	THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLMETERS
Line_6336	RENGES ON THE FAR LEFT AND THE MIDDL THERE IS A GRADURATED SILANDER AND ON THI SIDE IS ONE LITER
Line_6337	MEASURE THINGS AR WATER FOR COOK GING
Line_6338	UM WHAT WE DO FORO MEASURING OF THINGS TSLS WE YOUSE HITCH TALL
Line_6339	YOU JUST REAED HOW MUCH
Line_6340	HOW MUCH WATER THERE WAAS IN ALL THE CERRANGEST PUT TOGETHER
Line_6341	THE UNITE WE USED OUR MELLOLITE MELLOLITERS UM LITERS
Line_6342	YOU WOULD MEASURE HOW MUCH WALTER THERE WAS
Line_6343	NEADE OTHER TO MEASURE CAPACITY SORINGES AND ALWAYS THE BEST TALCAS THAT COULD STUCK UP THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_6344	YOU LOOKED AT HOW MUCH THERE WAS TUTTL
Line_6345	YOU COULD SENSE THAT IWAS COLED
Line_6346	U A THERMOMETER BECAUSE THERMOMETER IS CONOLUTIVE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_6347	IT MEASURES SOMETHING AND THE THING THAT A THRMOUNTOR MEASURES IS TEMPERATURE CELCIES DEGREES OR FAIRIN HEIGHT DEGREES
Line_6348	THE THIRD AND FIFT CUPS ARE HOTTER THAN THE SECANDT AND THE FIRST CUP
Line_6349	GETS SWALMMER
Line_6350	WE TOOK THE ICE WATER AND
Line_6351	IT'S FIFTY DEGREES SOUTH YAS SO IT'S WARMER THAN THE WATER ON THE LEFT WHICH IS TEN DEGREES S YEAS
Line_6352	TELS YOU THAT THE WATER IS WARMER THAN THE TEMPERATURE UPS THE LITTLE WATER
Line_6353	THE WATER THIS MARKED TENDEGARE IS SALCI YES TENDEGARS SALTS YES
Line_6354	IT'S NEXBY MARNEY
Line_6355	UM THE KILUM AND IN CEL CEE A SCREEN
Line_6356	WELL I DISCOVERET THAT IT GOT COLDER AND U
Line_6357	THEY HAVE BEEN THAT  AN THE FIRST HIGH
Line_6358	ARNED THE LOD AND THEY GOT ERLLY COLD AND WE COULD WERENT ALL  TO PUT A HAND IN WHICH WAS SAT BECAUSE WE WERE HOT
Line_6359	IT GETS IT STAYES THE SAME AND THEN GET WHAT GET WN
Line_6360	WELL IT STARTED REALLY HIGHE AND THEN IT GOT COLDER AND COLDER
Line_6361	THE LITTLE RED LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE BLUD GOES DOWN
Line_6362	GOOD STOIN M SNO IT STOD ID HI
Line_6363	WEL IT'S GETTING QUOLER AND CLI POO
Line_6364	IT TAKES MORE SPACE AND STIRTS TO BRARN
Line_6365	I DISPLAID IT WAL ON THA LINE
Line_6366	I DREW WITH LITTLE DOTS ON A ING GRAS
Line_6367	LL THERE WAS THAT PUP GO
Line_6368	WEL IT HELPS YOU
Line_6369	IN ERES AID TIAIL  AND THAT'S NOT MEANY AND YEAH
Line_6370	I PUT THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MINETS OF HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN
Line_6371	THE DOLTS ARE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND THEN THE DOTS SHO IT MOVING DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND UP AND WHATEVER
Line_6372	WENTY DEGREES IS
Line_6373	YOU IS SEENG HOW MANY MINNTES HI'RE BEEN BETWEEN TWENTY UMS  AR OUT
Line_6374	UM E MOCHA
Line_6375	STARTING THE FIRST NUMBER UNS END ING AT THE LAST NUMBER
Line_6376	TEE STARTED APY AND IT AT TWENTY IT'S FIFTEEN
Line_6377	I MEAN IF I TIRE OR
Line_6378	THE FIRST TO ARE BELOW SECITY AND THE SECOND TWO ARE OVER FI
Line_6379	THAT'S THE FIRST YOU ARE LOWER THAN FIFTY AND THE SECOND
Line_6380	UH MY NAME SARI
Line_6381	WHAT WE A MASCER CIMPLY IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON MONEY
Line_6382	TO MEASURE THINGS AND ALSO SOME KAND O STICK THAT LITTLE LONGER THEAN YOU D STICKS
Line_6383	YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS AND IT'S MAINLY ABOUT HOW LONG IT IS
Line_6384	SO WE PUT ONE STRAW IN FRONT OF ANOTHER STRAP ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS TABLE TO FIGER OUT HOW LONG THE TABLE WAS
Line_6385	WE WORKTON IS IN THIS STRAWS
Line_6386	IT THINK THAT THE A DIFFERENT SIZE DOS SOMETIMES
Line_6387	WE HAD DIFFERENT LENGTH  STRAWS TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENT  T IT COULD LOOK LIKE I THINK
Line_6388	IT WAS SEVEN STRAWS FOR GROUP
Line_6389	THE'RE'S THE SAME FOR THE STANDARD MEASUREMENTS
Line_6390	YOU NEED TO ISE THE SAME SIE
Line_6391	IT MEANS KILLOMETERS
Line_6392	I UHMOST EVERY BY THE A THE ENTIRE WORLD
Line_6393	SO WE AS TO MADE IT AND WEAN AND THE PINKIES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT
Line_6394	OSE THEM TO I'M NOT SHOURE
Line_6395	THECAUSE THAT SHOWS USE BECAUSE THEY SHAW YOU NUMBERS AND IT SEESZIER SO YOU KNOW
Line_6396	IS THERE SAN'T SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT HELPS YOU MEASURE
Line_6397	THEY'RE ALL SCIENTIFPFIC MEASUREMENT UIS
Line_6398	IT'S ABOUT MEASURING DIFFERENT SIZES HOVE THINGS AND ITA SCIENTIFIC WAY AND LENGTH AND WAYT
Line_6399	THERE IS ONE ENCH ON THE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
Line_6400	YOUR A PINKKIE OR OUR HANDD OR FOT
Line_6401	THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENTSE
Line_6402	WELL IT SEEMES KIND UP LIKE YOU U
Line_6403	MEASURING IT WLESSH YOUR PINKIE OR WITH YOUR HAND OR FEET OR PART OF YOUR BODY BY MEASURING IT THAT WAY
Line_6404	WELL IF THE HAND IS FIVE INCHES MAL UP I MEAN TEN INCHES LONG SO THEN THE SIDE WILL BE ABOUT
Line_6405	WELL THE WHIHT BORDS ESTIMATE WOULD PROBABLY BE SWAR ROULARS ALONG WHICH WOULD BE
Line_6406	WELL IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING AT TON OF TIMES YOU'RE PROBABLY WHEN THAT TIME'S GONG TO GET THE RIGHT ESTIMATE SO IT HELPS YOU
Line_6407	ETTING BETTER AT ESTIMATING BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU GET BETTER AND GET THE CLOSER AS
Line_6408	HOU YOU KNOW HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6409	AT A WHORSE RANCE YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE CARING MEASURING PAPER  BUT IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG YOUR HOURSE WAS YOULD PROBABLY NEED ESTIMATE
Line_6410	USE A MEASURING TAPE OR USE YOUR AN OR RUFFROM
Line_6411	IT HELPS YOU FIGER OUT HOW LONG SOMETHING IS
Line_6412	BECAUSE METER TAPES ARE THE SAME SIZE AND ANS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6413	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS
Line_6414	IT SHOWES YOU THAT IF YOU BEGIN AT ONE ND END AN END AT THE OTHER
Line_6415	GETTING AN END OF THE TABLE
Line_6416	IT FELT KIND OF HUD BECAUSE NOBADY HAD THE EXACT RIGHT WAIGH TO MEASURE PROMMETES TIGHT
Line_6417	WAS UMPORTAN THAT WE FIDERED OUT THE CLOSEST GUESS WE COULD GET TO WITH A FRIEND
Line_6418	WE NEEDED TO LANK THE CRAFT CAPNITE NEY EXCEPT THE TEACHER RECOMMENDED
Line_6419	S IMPORTAANTD BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN IF THE ANSWER THE SAME ANSWER TVICE THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT CRECT ANSWER
Line_6420	WOAS A LITTLE HIGHTE BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE SAME RESULT THAT IT CAME OUT A LOHT DIFFERENTLY
Line_6421	E METER TAPE BECAUSE YOU CANT REALLY BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY BRAKE THE METERS TIK IT AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO ME
Line_6422	LIKE THE AU CHECT WAS BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING OR
Line_6423	IN GOOD HAS THE SAME SIZE AS ONE KILLOMETER
Line_6424	IT GIVES US RERUM TO D STUFF BECASE IE AN AIN FRIS SOLSE OF IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL
Line_6425	ERE WARN'T REALLY ANY BODY PART MEASUREMENTS THAT WERE THE SAME COULD WE DOIN'T GET TO FINISH MEASURING BEFORE WE LAOFT FOR THUS
Line_6426	THE FIGHT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE FLOAWR ARE
Line_6427	E AR BUT OTHERS AREN NOW BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BODDY PARTS THAT ARE THE SAME THAT'S EVERY BODDY PARTS A LITTLE DIFFENT
Line_6428	YOU PROBABLY ERS THE REFERANCE THE PINKIE HAS TWO IN STEAD OF ONE
Line_6429	YOU USE THE SMALLEST NAIM NOT SOUR WHAT ITS CALLED
Line_6430	I GUESS I THINK IT KIND F BOOCASE LIKE SOMETHING I'M NOT YOUR
Line_6431	YOU O'LL PLOASE THEM WHEN LOS AND A METLE STICK OH WHEN YOU'RE ANABLED TO MEASURE SOMETHING
Line_6432	WE'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MASSS TODAY AND MISSUS HINE'S CLASSC
Line_6433	THEN WE MEASURED THE MASS AND ESTIMATED THAT WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND WHITH A STEAEL TWICE
Line_6434	ESAL STEL TO FIGR THE WEIGHT
Line_6435	FOUND IT MAKES IT
Line_6436	WELL YOU COULD USE DIFFERENT REFERENCES TO MEASURE THEM
Line_6437	IT'S A PAPER CLIP
Line_6438	GROUP TWO HAS A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND GROUP ONE HAS A SMALLER PAPER CLIP
Line_6439	YOU COULD HAVE THE M WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH YOU COULD HAVE THA IS THE SAME SIZE INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT SIZES
Line_6440	GROUP TWO HAS SMALLER SULTS GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER RESULTS
Line_6441	THAT'S ONE GRAM WE LOLVE BOS FOR MAGNING HOW MUCH STUFF WEIGHTED
Line_6442	WE MEASURED THE THINGS WE IS JUST SIENT
Line_6443	LOVES YOU M ARE EXACT ANSWER
Line_6444	I NOW THAT IT WEIGHS MORE THAN A SMALL ONE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE A MASS
Line_6445	THE LARGE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_6446	WELL EEASE THE MIDDAL DISK IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY GRAMS THERE AREN
Line_6447	IT'S IN A PERFECTLY STRAT INE
Line_6448	WELL I'M NOT REALLIYST OBSERVED WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT
Line_6449	AN BECAUSE WE'RE MATERING WITH GRAMS M
Line_6450	ONE GRAM FIVE ONE GRAM FIVE IT MA TELLS YOU
Line_6451	HERE BEING IS TO MEASURE THE MASS OF THE PIECE OF WOOD
Line_6452	CONSAY ALL RIGHT THE PENCIL IS TWO NICLARS THAT MUST NAIM ITS TEN GRAMS
Line_6453	A METAL DISCWAIGS EA GRAM
Line_6454	THE TOIY CAR WEIGHS SEVEN NY GRAMS
Line_6455	TWENTY BLUWE
Line_6456	IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IT'S SO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MATER BUR
Line_6457	THE ORANGE WEIGHS MORE THAN ALL THE GRAM PIECES AND THE CUP
Line_6458	WELL OUR TEATURE HAD US TAKE IN SIENCE TO DAY SHE HAD US TOAKE
Line_6459	THE ORANGE WEIGHS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAMS
Line_6460	IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS AND A LETHER SIDE IT'S ONE HUNDRED GRAMS TWO
Line_6461	A KELOGRAM IS TEN OF ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6462	YOU YOU NEED TO USE A SCAIL
Line_6463	TWO THREE AND EIT
Line_6464	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORK TODAY WE WORKED WITH A SPUNGE AND WATER
Line_6465	SPUNGE ON THE LEFT AS DRY THE SPUNGE IN THE MIDDLE U SWET AND THE SPUNGE ON THE RIGHT S SOKED AND THEY GREW AS THEY GOT WET AND DREW DRY
Line_6466	WELL IT'S A SPUNGE THAT IS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WET
Line_6467	IT'S A WET SPUNGE WHICH MEANS IT HASN'T GO ON AO THEWAY TO SOKE A SOKED SPUNGE BUT IT IS STILL GETTING BIG T STILL BIGGER THAN
Line_6468	IT MEANS THAT IT'S TOTALLY WEAT AND IT'S OU IT'S DRIPPING AND REALLY WET
Line_6469	WHEN IT'S ALLTHE IT WHEN IT'S LARGEST IT CAN GET
Line_6470	YOU CAN TAKE THE WET SPUNGE YOU CAN EARSE A SPUNGE ANERSE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6471	THERE IS NO GRAMS AND THE CUANIO NEED TO PUT GRAMS AND THE CUP O UM
Line_6472	YOU USE GRAMS TO WEIGH IT
Line_6473	SPUNCH IS FOR THREE GRAMS LONG
Line_6474	ERE' SPUNGE WIGHTS THREE GRAMS FILL UNIFORM
Line_6475	IT'S THREE GRAMS
Line_6476	IT'S UM SIX TEEN GRAMS LONG IT'S SIX TEEN GRAMS AND IT WEIGHTS
Line_6477	YOU CAN  IT YOU CAN MEASURE THE DIFFERENTS
Line_6478	SO YOU MEASURED THE MTH OUT AND THE ANSWERS CERCHING GRAMS WATER BECAUSE YOU TOOK THREE AWAY
Line_6479	IT CAN HOLD THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER
Line_6480	YOU W'RE TRYING TO FIGGER OUT THE DIFFERENTS
Line_6481	H I WOULD PROBB LE OU ONE PART AT A TIME
Line_6482	WELL IT SORT OF TELLS ME THAT I CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IT  WAS
Line_6483	AND MANLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH LEFT AND THE CUP
Line_6484	YOU GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME AR BECAUSE THE GROUP ONE IS BIGGER AND GROUP TWO IS SMALL
Line_6485	IT'S A PICK TURAVLTOR
Line_6486	WELL WE CAN MEASURE DIFFERENT WATERS A MOAUNS OF WATERS OUT
Line_6487	ORE A MASHOWING HOW MUCH WATER IS O THE CUP
Line_6488	SOTHAT WE CAN UM
Line_6489	WITH THE LITTLE SPINNERS ONE NOLMETER IT'S THING ITWS ONE HUNDRED AN MELMETERS
Line_6490	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6491	I USED THEM AND COOK GAING
Line_6492	IT'S FOR VALIUS WHICH IS EITY EAT GROUP ONTS IS FOR WHICH IS AIGTY MELAMETERS AND
Line_6493	STUFF THE STUFF THAT WE NADE TO MAAR
Line_6494	I'M NOT SHURE
Line_6495	UM MILLAMETERS
Line_6496	IT'S PUSHING THE WATER AND THE SIDES REAL OUT THE FROUNT
Line_6497	YOU WOULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND MARED HOW MAIN IT DWAS
Line_6498	THEY RAPREZENT DIFRENT MUMBERSFOR MILLMIETERS
Line_6499	A SHEARED WATER
Line_6500	THAT WAS ABOUT CUM OCA
Line_6501	ATER AIY B SEANDY THROUGH THAT ACOR D
Line_6502	WEL A SALT OF THE
Line_6503	A SPRON CURRENTH OR WHATEVER LITTLE SCOARDY THINGS COULLED
Line_6504	THEY TELL YOU TO THEY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS AND YOU CALL THIS CONVERNCATION
Line_6505	ONE TWO THREE FOR FIVE SIXS SEVEN EIT NIN TEN SO EACH ONE MS WA
Line_6506	EACH LIGNE REPRESENTED TWO IT DIDN'T HAVE THE DARKER LIGNES THAT THEY
Line_6507	ONE HUNDRED
Line_6508	THIS ES THE MAXIMUM THAT'S HALF OF ONE HUNDRED
Line_6509	I I'M LOGOR
Line_6510	ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED GALOMS
Line_6511	ILL CALLM THE BACK AND SEE WHAT THE VOLLIUM SAY
Line_6512	HOW MUCH THERE WAS FROM THE BOTTOME CLIME BEA
Line_6513	EACH ONE IS FIFTY MILLIMETERS
Line_6514	THE VOLIUME MABPLESS IND THE CAP
Line_6515	YOU  COULD MEASURE UH THE WAY TO THE TOP
Line_6516	TWO HUNDRED MILLAMETERS OF WATER ARE FILLED WITH THES SLOOP
Line_6517	THE'RE CAN TAINES
Line_6518	A HUNDRED MALALITORS
Line_6519	THEY' ARE DIFFERENT SIENCES BUT THEY'R'S THE SAN OTHER WIRES
Line_6520	IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED MILLMETERS OF WATER TWO IT DO IT
Line_6521	THAT THE SHAPE AND THE VOLIUME ARET ALWAYS THE SAME THE VOLIUME AND TAP DON'T MATTER BUT THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER DOUS
Line_6522	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT UM MAGNETIC STUFF
Line_6523	WELL THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THOGH THERE'S A CIRFICE UM BLOCKING IT THEY STILL CAN STICK
Line_6524	I CAN RELAX THE LAN
Line_6525	WELL ON THE THICKER PAPER IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT'S TO THICK BUT ON THE THINER PAPER IT'S THIN SO IT CANT STICK
Line_6526	I DON'T KNOW
Line_6527	WEIH THE LON SIAR OBJECT IS A NAIL AND SO UM WHEN THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_6528	I'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6529	WE WEARE UM WE WARE DOING MEASURING AND YEAH THAT'S STUFF
Line_6530	I'M SORY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6531	YES UM MAINLY IT WAS THE WASHER
Line_6532	WHAT HOW TIGHT THE MOLECUS ARE MOLECULES ARE SORY
Line_6533	NO WE USED A SKAIL
Line_6534	COUNTERWEITS OR THINGS THAT MAKE OTHER THINGS ON A SCAIL EVEN LIKE STRIPLIKE STRAT SIDE TO SIDE
Line_6535	I DON'T KNOW YOU'R WHAT YOU MEAN
Line_6536	BECAUSE METAL WEIGHS MORE THAN PLASTICK
Line_6537	IT WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_6538	BALANCE BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'R NOT RIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS
Line_6539	YES IF IT'S ON TH SCAIL
Line_6540	THE PLASTIC CHIP AND PAPER CLIPS ARE ON A SCAIL AND CUPS AND THE EAQUAL
Line_6541	WE'VE BEEN DOING THE VISON AND WEIGHN
Line_6542	HE PLASTIC CHIP THEN THE WOODEN CUB THEN THE METAL RING
Line_6543	OR TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE WEIGHS MORE
Line_6544	THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_6545	A THAT'S ALL I THINK
Line_6546	UM YOU COULD UM GED IT' UHM OR RAY I UND UM LUMAY ASTIMEATE
Line_6547	TWENTY AND THAT'S YOUD I THINK THAT'S IT
Line_6548	UM IT'S HOW MCH THEY ARE IN SOLCIES
Line_6549	UM BECAUSE WHEN IF YOU DO IT WHILE IT'S STILL MOVING YOU N' HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
Line_6550	HE PLACE IT UNDER WATER TU AND THEN THE ALCAHOL CU  UP GOES UP OR DOWN
Line_6551	OW UM HOW MUCH HOW HOT OR COLD HOW HOT OR COLD THEY ARE IN SOLCIS
Line_6552	UM WE HAVE BEN UM MEASURING VOLUTE UM AND WEAITS YEAH
Line_6553	MARNEY I DON'T GET THAT
Line_6554	AND THE AND THE GRAMS WOULD GO TO THE BOTTOM AND THE SPONGE WOULD
Line_6555	I THINKS THANKS FOR LETTING ME TEACH YOU BY MARNEY
Line_6556	OH YEAT TO DAY WE MEASURED HOW MUCH WATER A SPUNCH CAN TAKE UP
Line_6557	WE USED GRAMS BECAUSE
Line_6558	I THINK THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT
Line_6559	HE METAL DISCK WAS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_6560	UM YEAH THAT'S SPACICCLEE YEAH
Line_6561	YEAH WE HAD THAT IN OUR CLASST AND THEN WE USED TE MOUNT
Line_6562	WELL THEOSE LITTLE NUMBERS ON THIS SIDE AND YOU LEAD THE TEMPERATURE THERE
Line_6563	ONE HUNDRED DE GREES IS
Line_6564	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WATER AND UM STUFF LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_6565	GRAMS ARE EASIER TO UNDER STAND
Line_6566	YOU YOU COMPARE IT WITH THE NICKLE
Line_6567	UM WHAT WHAT STUFF EQWHAT STUFF EQUAL
Line_6568	AND AND TEN GRAMS EQUALS ONE TEN BIG GRAM
Line_6569	YOU FIRST PUT IN THE ORANGE AND THEN YOU
Line_6570	THE ORANGE WEIGHS A LOT MORE THAN THOSE GRAMS
Line_6571	FIVE TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_6572	UM WHICH ONE WAS HOTTER AND WHICH ORM WAS COLDER
Line_6573	THE ROBY IS STICKING HIS FINGER IN CUP BE TO SEE IF IT'S HOT OR COLD
Line_6574	IT MEANS THAT AY IS UM ITS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM TH SEE AND SEE IS A  DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FROM BEATH
Line_6575	WHICH ONE IS HOTTER
Line_6576	UM YOU COULD USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE UM THE TEMPERATURE OR YOU COULD DISUSE YOUR FINGER
Line_6577	YOU STICK A THERMOMETER AND UM THEN IF THEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS
Line_6578	WE WANT TO USE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS
Line_6579	UM I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_6580	YOU WOULD LOOK UM CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT TEMPERATURE IT WAS
Line_6581	ON SOME IT S REALLY HOT AND ON SOME IT'S REALLY COLD
Line_6582	THE THERMOMETER IS
Line_6583	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE WORD FOR IT
Line_6584	IT'S THE OULCOHOL
Line_6585	THE THE ICE WATER I MEAN THE ICE IT MOUNTS IN THE WATER AND THEN IT MAKES IT AND THEN THE ICE MAKES IT COLDER
Line_6586	AND IT'S GETTING COLDER
Line_6587	WE'VE  BEEN DOING LIKE WEIGHING THINGS
Line_6588	WE PUT IT IN ONE SIDE OF THE SCKAIL AND THEN WE WEITED TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS BY PUTTING GRAM WEIGHTS ON THE OTHER SIDE
Line_6589	AND YOU CAN ADD MORE GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCE OR TAKE OUT GRAMS TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_6590	WELL IT TAKES LIKE THE DISC THE METAL DISC IS BALANCED WITH THE GRAM WEIGTS
Line_6591	WELL YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF DIFFERENT WELL YOU CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LOT OF GIFE
Line_6592	HINGS YOU CAN WATER AND EA ARIT'S PRETY MUCH THE EASIEST ONES AND THE ONLY ONES THAT WE'VE DONE
Line_6593	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS HOTEST AND WHICH WAS COLDEST AND WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDL
Line_6594	HE'S MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DIFFERENT CUPS
Line_6595	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THEM SOME F THE CUP S ARE GOINGNA BE COLDER THAN OTHERS
Line_6596	IT
Line_6597	WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT WANT'S TO EXPAND IT MEANS THAT THE WATER IS HOTER
Line_6598	I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
Line_6599	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING TEMPERATURES LEANMTH CAPCILY AND MASSES
Line_6600	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOMITERS OR HOW COLD IT IS
Line_6601	WE WERE TRYING TO FIGGURE OUT WHICH WAS THE COURSE AND RICHRE THE MEDIAM AND RICH WAS THE HARTEST I MEAN WARMEST
Line_6602	WALWA IS INCITING ONE OF HIS FINGERS INTO THE CUP B
Line_6603	OW FIRST IT WAS A PRENTY THE GRIZ THEN A DROP THE FIVE DIGGERS THEN THE VENTOLLY RUN UP
Line_6604	ELL B UM SIBATIONS RE
Line_6605	WELL OBSERVATION THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS UM MAKE GRAMS AND CHOPT ABOUT THE THINGS AND YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT
Line_6606	I LIKE CIENCE BILLY MUCH AND CIENCE ITS MY FAVERET LEARNIANG SUBJECT
Line_6607	HUNDRED UH ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IS BOILING POINTS SO THE WATER WILL BE BOILING
Line_6608	OILING IS BILT BEA HA
Line_6609	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPUNGES CAN OBSORB
Line_6610	THE LTHE LEFT ONE IS DRIY THE MIDDLE ONE IS WET AND THE RIGHT ONE IS SOKED
Line_6611	IT ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER
Line_6612	IT'S SORT OF CRACKLS
Line_6613	IT'S WET SO IT MOVE IT'S WET SO IT MOVES MORE ESILY AND IT'S OBSORBED SOME WATER
Line_6614	E SPUNGE HAS GOTEN BIGGER AND MORE FLEXCIABLE AND LESS HARD
Line_6615	THE WATER DRIPS OUT AND IT GETS IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
Line_6616	WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITH OUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET
Line_6617	THE SPUNGE HAS OBSORBED WATER AND SO IT'S TIPPING THE BALANCE SCAIL
Line_6618	THE SPUNGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE
Line_6619	THE SPUNGE IS WEIGHING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE IT'S OBSORBING WATER
Line_6620	GRAM WEITS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONGE AND IT WAS EQUAL
Line_6621	WE HAVE MEASURED TEMPERATURE
Line_6622	TEMPERATURE IS HOW HOT OR HOW COLD THINGS ARE AND YOU CAN USE THERMOMETERS TO TELL
Line_6623	WHICH WAS THE COLEDEST AND WHICH WAS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDL
Line_6624	WAS AND IF IT WAS THE COLDEST OR THE WARMEST
Line_6625	THE ROBU IS TESTING CUT BE WITH HIS FINGER
Line_6626	IT MEANS THAT SOME HAVE HIER DEGREES THAN OTHERS AND THIS ROAWBOUT IS TRYING TO TELL
Line_6627	WHICH ONE IS COLDEST WARMEST AND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_6628	AND LIQUIDS AND SOME SOLIDS AND MOST GASSEIS
Line_6629	MEASURED THE EXACT DEGREES AND HOW DIFFERENT ALL THE CLASSIC MEASUREMENTS WERE
Line_6630	IT SHOWS HOW MANY DEGREES THAT THE THING IT'S IN ARE
Line_6631	THEY SHOW HOW MANY DEGREES THE THING THAT THEY'RE IN IS
Line_6632	WE CAN DO CELCY S OR FAR IN HEIGHT THESE THERMOMETERS SHOW CELCIIS
Line_6633	WE WERE CHECKING THE CHANGES AND TEMPERATURE EVERY MINIT
Line_6634	WE NOTICED SORT OF A SAT THE SAME DEGREES AND ITS SORT OF ROSE AFTER A FEW MINNETES SLOWLY
Line_6635	THE ICE COOPBS WILL MELT AND THE WATER WILL GET WARMER
Line_6636	IT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE THE ICE CUB IS FROSAN WATER SO IT'S COLD
Line_6637	I SEE FIFTEEN DIGAREES  DIFFURANTS
Line_6638	AND RIGHT IT DOUT OF COURSE OR
Line_6639	I SEE THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN I LA A LOD ALOUT AND THEN SLOWLY GOING UPWARD
Line_6640	KIND OF JUST SOKED UP ALL THE WATER THAT IT CAN HOLD
Line_6641	MEAN IT'S KIND OF BEN JUST SOKING UP WATER
Line_6642	UM HE UN
Line_6643	I DON'T REALY KNOW WHAT A SOP SPUNGE IS
Line_6644	THANKXS MY GODDEEAR BYE
Line_6645	UM MAT UM MOULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_6646	WE MEASURED HOW WE MEASURED HOW MUCH THE TEMPERATURE WAS AND SAW HOW COLD IT WAS
Line_6647	WE MEASURED HOW COLD IT WAS WITH THE THERMOMETER AND  THE BE WAS COLDEST
Line_6648	HOW COLD AND HOW HOT IT WAS
Line_6649	OKAY WE WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD WITH A WEIGHT WITH THE WEIHT LAST WEEK
Line_6650	WE COULD USE A RULER AND MEASURE HOW HI IT WENT UP TO
Line_6651	IT COULD TELL US HOW HI THE CUP THE CUP COULD HOLD WATER
Line_6652	AP THE VOLIUME OF LIQUID AND THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN
Line_6653	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD
Line_6654	HE VOLIUME IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND THE CAPACITY  THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD BUT THE VOLIUME IS HOW MUCH IT'S HOLDING KNOW
Line_6655	I COULD FILL IT UP TO THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
Line_6656	WE COULD USE A  TO CIRRENGE AND MEASURE HOW MUCH
Line_6657	WE COULD USE A CIRENGE TO MEASURE IT
Line_6658	I DID THINGS

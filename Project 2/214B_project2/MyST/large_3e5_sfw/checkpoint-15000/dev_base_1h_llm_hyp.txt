Line_0	I I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CANNETIEC ENERGIES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULBS SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULBS CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK IT NEVER MIND
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULB LIT
Line_7	CANNETIC ENERGY AND THEN A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GO T THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICED THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THE
Line_10	JONNEGRIVITLE SIDE
Line_11	I I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TWO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICED THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COAL
Line_14	ARMY OSOMNIS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW WILL THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_16	IT'S THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FALL COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY OBSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE IS IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUMO AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUNS TO SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY
Line_25	WES METAL OR A COPPER OR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUNY STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE RULER IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE PA THE PUTS LOW WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT WE JUST ESTABLISHED THAT
Line_30	MADE OF A MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN MADE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	LITERS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL L
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CON CONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	ET BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND THAT SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAX MELT
Line_38	WHIT WHICH IS THE THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANY THINGS
Line_40	IS BURNING AND FLAMING AND S
Line_41	USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WIN GOING ON A HATRACK BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	EN JUST PRODUCING OFF GIVING GET ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HEAR SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT OTHERS TOO
Line_44	HE ALL WAS WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	WILL BURN TOO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS A SOLAR POWER COAL
Line_47	IT WILL COME PUT THE SUN TO THE SOLUTE POWDER TO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THAT TRANSFERING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	O CA TO WE SKIP THIS S
Line_49	NONE REUSED THE BLOW
Line_50	IS ONLY THE ONE TIME USED AND COAL IS JUST AND COAL IT IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BUT LONG TIME
Line_51	THEORY WILL NOT SITTING A I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	CIRCUITS AND UH WELL CIRCUITS
Line_54	I THINK THAT UHM BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS A LOCUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH E AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY ROAD IT CON
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT ITS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RATICAL WAY
Line_59	BRIGHTER OR BE R TO COMPLICATE IT
Line_60	THAT'S I DO NOT KNOW A LEVERS
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THEN D IS FLOWING AND A IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	ELL A I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN
Line_65	IT IS THE COAT CLOCK
Line_66	THEN NO S N
Line_67	NOT
Line_68	M BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THIS CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPER CONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS
Line_72	UH I DON'T NOT
Line_73	SORRY AND BUSY AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIMES WITH THAT
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BISY REALLY BISY YEA
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE LIST I SA
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINMAL WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS OLUMINIUM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END
Line_78	THE I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE LET ME HURRY UP
Line_79	STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS
Line_80	H I'M COLOARBLONE I'M A COLOR BLONG SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH IT'S GREY
Line_81	MATALIC ETTUMS
Line_82	THEY ARE VERY ME TICK AND VERY MEATALICK
Line_83	MAGNETS
Line_84	THEY WOULD REPEL OBVIOUS E
Line_85	UH IT
Line_86	IT SELTS AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
Line_87	THEY ARE SIMILAR BEE IT NEVER MIND CAN WE MOVE ON
Line_88	SOME ARE REPELLING AND SOME ARE ATTRACTING THE END END THE SORRY I LEARN THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Line_89	A PERSON WITH THE COMPASSES
Line_90	BE CAUSE OF THE MAGNET
Line_91	ITS IS MAGNETISM GOING THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_92	BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
Line_93	BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUT THE POLES AND POLES ATTRACTS
Line_94	MAGNET IT'S HARD FOR MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS STICK
Line_95	IT IS NOT STICKING
Line_96	BECAUSE WE LEARN THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_97	THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
Line_98	METAL AND MAGNETISM
Line_99	ONE A MAGNET
Line_100	MAGNETISM
Line_101	IT WOULD AND NOT BE MAGNETISM THAT NO MORE LONGER STUFF
Line_102	UH NOT EARRING MUCH
Line_103	-MAGNETISM
Line_104	THE FLOW OF MAGNETISM IS GOING
Line_105	MAGNETIC FORCE TO IT IT DO OR THE HAND
Line_106	THE MAGNET TURNS OFF IT TURNS OFF D SO IT'S YOU DO
Line_107	MAGNETISM
Line_108	DON'T KNOW I DON'T CARE
Line_109	IT IS HAPPENING
Line_110	I OBSERVED THAT THE SPACERS LIKE PREVENTING THE MAGNETIC FIELD YOU KNOW
Line_111	UH MARS MO MOST OF ME
Line_112	-MAGNETIC
Line_113	SPREADING THE PARTS
Line_114	MAGNETIC FIELD

Line_118	GNETIC FORCE A MAGNETS
Line_119	HOW I CAN I PUT THEM TOGETHER PLEASE TELL ME
Line_120	THEN SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN I GUESS A TE
Line_121	I NO YOU WHAT'S TALKING ABOUT ARE YOU PROUD OF ME MOTHER
Line_122	I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL I DIDN'T SAY THAT L THE
Line_123	MAGNETISM AND
Line_124	THE STICK VINNITES
Line_125	BECAUSE I'M HABYIUUUUU IT'S MOCKERS
Line_126	T THAT'S WHY YOU WASN'T WORKING BECAUSE I DID A HIT THE SWITH GET IT
Line_127	IT'S NOT A MAGNET ANYMORE OH MY GOD
Line_128	SORRY THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES WE JUST TELL LEAVING A LON LEAVING A LON BUT YOU'RE HEARTING THE
Line_129	DAVIDS DAIVID'S FLEARTING WITH THE GA
Line_130	EVEN WAS FLARTING WITH A GIRL DEVON WAS FLARTING WITH HIBERFLOW DIVE FLARTING WITH A GIRL
Line_131	HIPRADICI
Line_132	EVERY THING THERE'S A C E D IN YOU
Line_133	UTIALY DID SHOW PLOPARE TEN
Line_134	RAPID S CHEESE
Line_135	AN THING
Line_136	I'M GOOD TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT OR AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	THEY'RE WIRES AND THEY TRY THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UM TO LIGHT THE BATTERY DIDN'T KNOW TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY AND A CIRCUIT UM
Line_141	THEY IT TRANSFORM THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUITS
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMS INTO LIGHT EN
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND A ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IT'S GETTING STUCK BY THE P
Line_146	THE ENERGY TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BOTH WEIGHED EVEN THOUGH THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCHED
Line_149	I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND THE BULB CAN
Line_151	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCE S
Line_152	G THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE A MOTOR
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM SORE ENERGY TO CONNETIC ENERGY
Line_155	THERE COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	TE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BOARDS
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECT ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THING CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FACING THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO T
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SOLAR SHELLS COLLECT
Line_165	WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T R
Line_167	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THERE IT IS WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THE MOTOR DOESN'T RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT THE D
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THINGS
Line_171	AA CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
Line_172	THERE IS A A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
Line_173	ALL METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_174	ALL OF THE METALS AND THE LIST ARE CONDUCTS ARE TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_175	ALLY METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_176	THE CIRCUIT RUNS
Line_177	I MADE A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_178	ALL ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_179	A CIRCUIT WITH THE INSULATOR INSULATE ELECTRICITY THEREFORE THE INSULATOR THAT THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RE
Line_180	INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL THERE FOR THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
Line_181	THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_182	WHEN I ADD IT INSULATORS TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
Line_183	CLOISED
Line_184	THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
Line_185	THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
Line_186	OOD
Line_187	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HOW END ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_188	IT IT POWERS THINGS LIKES TO STEM AND AND COMPUTORS
Line_189	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE WAX MELTING
Line_190	THE A CANDLE MOUNTS
Line_191	IT FELT VERY HOT
Line_192	THEY HAD NO SOUND
Line_193	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALTERNATES ENERGY SOURCES
Line_194	IT POWERS AND EVERYTHING FROM FAR TO TOSTERS
Line_195	I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE MAXWELL MELTING-
Line_196	THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THEREFORE THE WAX IS A MELTING
Line_197	THERE IS NO SOUND
Line_198	SINCE THE PERSON IS PUTTING THEIR HANDS UNUMS IS MAKING SOUND
Line_199	THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THEREFORE SHE'LL NEED ENERGY FROM THE APPLES TO EAT
Line_200	CANDLE APPLES WOOD IT STICKS OUT IN THE FIELD
Line_201	IT GETS BLACK AND FLY
Line_202	THE THE SOLAR SOLVE NOT AMITS SMOKE BUT THE GASOLINE DONE
Line_203	THE NAME FOR NOT RENEWABLE ALL HE'S FOSSIL FUELS
Line_204	THEY CAN BE USED FOR EVERY
Line_205	THEY- THEY WORK ON

Line_212	COAL GASES AND OIL
Line_213	PARALLEL IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_214	SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_215	TE THE LIGHT BULB TAKES IN ENERGY AND TAKES OUT ENERGY
Line_216	TO TIP TO TO TO TO TIL ECHO TO
Line_217	I NEED TO HELP
Line_218	THEY ALL HAVE TWO BATTERIES YEAH
Line_219	Y THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MANY MORE WIRES STAR FOR THE ENERGY WILL LESS
Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRES
Line_221	COURSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES S
Line_222	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE ITS POLES
Line_224	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_225	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER
Line_226	THE SIMILARITY OF MAGNETS THAT ATTRACT EACH OTHER ARE THAT THEY'RE NOT
Line_227	EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELDS
Line_228	THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT A COMPASS THAT USES THE RTHS MAGNETIC POLE S
Line_229	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND OTHER STUFF
Line_230	WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND MAGNETS FIELDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_231	THE MAGNETIC FIELDS GOING THROUGH A PAPER THERE FOR MAKING THE PAPER CLIP THERE FOR MAKING THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE MAG
Line_232	THE FIRST THIN STACK THE POWER CAN GO THROUGH IT BUT WITH THE SIX STACK IT CAN

Line_261	SLOMMOWED RUBLA
Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTORS
Line_263	THEY ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
Line_264	ITS HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER
Line_265	IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THERE THEN THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER ONTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN S COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFORMS AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILAMENT AND THEY'RE GETS SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_277	BENT THE ELECTRAMS FLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICED THE ELECTRONS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVES
Line_279	WELL WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULB WHILE STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT POINTS WOULD NOT YET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN IF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	ONS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION A IS HAPPENING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THAT THE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSFERS ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT PEN
Line_289	BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	EN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN'T FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	HE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	E ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUNLIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR SHELL
Line_299	THIS WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	AND MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR A CORE TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS STRONG CAUSES NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	TELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	MIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SOME ARE CONDUCTORS UM ARE INSULATOR
Line_306	ALLY THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UH IF YOU PUT AN INSULATOR UM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE OPTICAL IT DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	SULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOWS THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE A LIKE A BRICKS WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	TRY STOPS RUNNING
Line_313	THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY LIT IN LIKE A PATHWAY
Line_314	ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS INTO MOTION OR A LIGHT OR SA
Line_315	YE A CANDLE BURNING SEAT
Line_316	BURNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO I SEE WAX MELTING
Line_317	SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHINGS CAN SIZZLE
Line_318	THE HEAT IS MINING FROM THE THE WITCH AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
Line_319	IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF HEAT AND MAKING A LIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A BUMPER SOME CAN A NOISE THAT THAT SEES ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE DRUM TO MAKE IT RELEACE SOUND
Line_322	WHILE THE PERSON'S BURNING CALORIES IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_323	WOOD GAS FOUND AND CANDLE
Line_324	IT'LL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND THE EVEN WATER
Line_325	LE IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENT LEAVE FROM
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I I AM NOT SURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUT DOOR THING
Line_330	THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CRILLY SMOG
Line_331	THEY POLLUTE THE EARTH WHILE SOLAR PANELS DO NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT T
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLOW
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY Y
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUE DUSTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE POWER TO LET THE ENERGY SLOW
Line_342	BE CAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FACE THE THE SAME POLTARY
Line_344	YOU PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POS
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WEIGHTS AND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEM FLOWS IN TWO WEIGHTS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND THE TWO BULBS
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED ON THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS LIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BAT THEN THE EL ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY AND AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND ONTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NOW ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE THE
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THEY'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BUR RAINS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF UM THE FILAMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	A ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILAMENT IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TO
Line_368	A FILAMENT BRAKES AND OPENS THE PATHWAYS
Line_369	WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW S STOPS
Line_370	THE FILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FROM ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	JUST PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORK BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN EASILY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HEAT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE AND AND IT STAYS ONE
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNED WHICH IS LIKE AN OPEN C
Line_375	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED THE PATHWAYS
Line_376	WE'LL UM
Line_377	I FILAMENT BROKE SO UM SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S A SERIES
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRCUIT LIKE AN OPEN SWI-
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARN HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S EITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNETS
Line_386	THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCKS IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	M MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	OKAY SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT OR AND AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DIS
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT IT IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT A MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	LIGHTING GETS ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ONE TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A CRACK
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLE'S ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THEY BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPASS SHOWING NORTH ON THE EARTH
Line_402	SOMEONE USING A COMPASS TO FIT WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FOLLOWS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTED METAL THAT IS STEEP INSIDE THE EARTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRON
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPPOST POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNET'S TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TWOS THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE MAG- PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING TEEN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZES EVERYTHING THAT'S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_416	BE CAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING FROM THE MAGNETS TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BRAKING WITH WEIGHT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN ST
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FOR IS BECAUSE IT IS TO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELDS MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AW
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKENS THE MAGNETIC A
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	IT IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAK
Line_427	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANCE
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACERS
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WRAP THE CORD WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETIZES THE POLE
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETTING COUNT IN TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAIN EDGE BECAUSE ELECTRO MAGNETS USE A STUN OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE S THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELDS
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER R
Line_438	IT MAGNETIZES THE COAL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COILS TO MAGNETISE IT
Line_440	THE THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL TO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC- MATERIALS
Line_442	HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETIZE THE THE RIVET
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	THIS THESE ARE WIRES A
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
Line_448	IT IS THE SOURD
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE- IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	I I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	THE WIRES ARE A PATH FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
Line_455	WHERE IS CARRYING ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THE LIGHT THE USED ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES A FLOWER BULB LIGHT
Line_458	IT HITS
Line_459	TH THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	SIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_461	IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUMP ON IT
Line_462	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE CLOSE TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FORMED TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRI- THE FLOW GOES THE OTHER WAY
Line_466	IT JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOES
Line_467	-TRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LANDING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE- THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG W
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
Line_475	THE M MOTOR USES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH IN THIS MIXTURE IS UP AND D
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT IT'S THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOW IN
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR SITS RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR IT'S RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THAT MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THE THING IN E
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLID CELLS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THEN THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I TRICK ON IT AGAIN
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR A STOP THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_492	HA SOLAR SALT DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
Line_493	I NOTICED THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN ITS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANEL
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS SITTING
Line_498	THE A NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS BRIDGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPSICLE STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	ON MILE
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSER I SAY IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS A METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WE BEEN RUNNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	THINK THAT UH THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE MAX- THE WAX IS MELTED
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAX MELT
Line_516	I I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT
Line_517	IT'S SEE A FLAME
Line_518	IT IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	UM SOME ONE IS DRUMMING
Line_520	S HE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEAR IT AND YEAH
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WAKE
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WALK
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFF MADE
Line_525	AIR GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	OKA Y
Line_528	UM THE SOLAR SOLTICLES THE CHER NOTE
Line_529	S STUFF
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NON RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTED
Line_532	UM THE COAL AND GAS PULL LETS THE AIR
Line_533	UM CON GASES WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CLOSE
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN'T STOPS
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND START CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULB
Line_541	EL ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_542	E BLUE DOTS THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY THAT'S HOW THE ELECTRICITY W
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERY WAY UP
Line_544	ONE I
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WE'LL NE AND MORE WIRES T
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHT TO A
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT FRIGHT
Line_548	IN THE THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHT S
Line_549	I I SEE THAT
Line_550	THE Y UH YOU ARE THE BEAUTIFUL MIST LADY IN THE WORLD
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHTER
Line_554	IT ARE TOO
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULBS WELL WE I
Line_556	IT GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE HOW COULD PUT THE POSITIVE MOUNT THROUGH THE
Line_557	THAT IS VALLEY CERECTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES AND THROUGH THE POS THEY RUN OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THE S UGLY WENT
Line_559	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATH WAYS
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THAT VERY QUIET
Line_562	NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS I
Line_563	THEY ARE BRIGHT
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO TO ACTUALLY IT ONLY GOES LYING BY U
Line_565	THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RIVET
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_570	IT THEY THERE ARE CHH LIGHTS IN THEM
Line_571	THERE IS ONE BULB THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BUL
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OR PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CRASH WAY
Line_574	UH THEY ARE THE'RE UN POND FIFTY
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS AM
Line_576	S I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHT
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS OUR DRIER YOU ARE THE DA W
Line_578	UM THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY ATE SALT
Line_579	THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOWS IN
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE L
Line_582	THE IT IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE MAGNETS
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THEY WERE THEN
Line_584	I DO NOT AURE YOU SO PRETTY YOU SAY IT'S AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO WHOLE HALF THE WEIGHTS AND THEY ARE GO
Line_586	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT'S
Line_587	IT LASTS LONG I
Line_588	ARE UH TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICKLY
Line_590	UH THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM S
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE FAT ON
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A CEL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND BOTH OF THE B
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEED A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT SO WE NEED THE POWWRALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SERIES A SORCUIT
Line_596	I AM GOOHOODED HOW ARE YOU MY BUT LIED
Line_597	I'VE FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND C THINGS OBVIOUSLY BULTH MORE IN SA
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE REAFIEGRAL WEIGHT TALL
Line_600	D THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
Line_601	THE NAIL THINGY IS STICKING ON TO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT'S IN IS MADE OF I MAYBE NOT
Line_603	WOOD YEA ON PLASTIC YEAH H
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL ON IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK IS DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOES NOT ATTRAP
Line_607	THEY BUT ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL I DON'T YOU THINK THAT
Line_608	THEY ARE BUL MADE OF IRON OR STEEL I
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_610	I TOLD YOU IF MAGNET STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OF A IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE OR STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL WINDS THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	ITS WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU U
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COMPASSES Y
Line_623	THES MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING E
Line_626	I THINK THAT IT IS BECAUSE UM IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY AT
Line_628	THE SAME SIDES ARE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPASS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND A SOUTH SAY ON EARTH A NOISEFUL IN A SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASE I
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW I
Line_636	THEY ARE PRETTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THE CAN NOT THE ONE DON'T LET GO
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL A NECK A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_642	T IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET ANY MORE
Line_644	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT ISN'T THE NAIL I MEAN IT ISN'T THE BATHNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BLUE STUFF MEAN THAT IT HAS
Line_646	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	I'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS M MOVING THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_650	BUT HIVE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CAR
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON B SIDE THEN THE MAKES
Line_652	THERE ARE WASHERS NO THEY'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO INTO THE CUP
Line_654	UHM THAT YOU CAN'T PUT THE SPACERS
Line_655	IT MOVES THE MAGNET FORCE E WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENS THE FORISTS
Line_657	I DO I NOT KNOW
Line_658	IT PUSH IN PUSH A
Line_659	W YOU PUT SPACE THE
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND L
Line_662	WELL IT MAKES THE THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_663	GOOFED
Line_664	WEIVE AND SAN HOW A LITTLE R RIVETS AND PICK UP WASHERS
Line_665	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WILL FLOW OR NOT
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE LIGHT'S SHOW FILL HE
Line_671	IT'S B NO WALCAY
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MANY
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	THERE IS ELS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	OUTS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
Line_676	ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVET MAKE A MAGNET AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_677	IT CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THING AND I COULDN'T PECKLSTOP
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT JUST ROLES IN THE STEEL WET
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BILLY IN TIL
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN T WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS S SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN'T
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO MAKES A ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_687	THEY HAVE TO T
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVET
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
Line_691	THEN IT CAN BE A A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEATS UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU ARE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE A LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK
Line_697	WITHOUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD UM NOT LIGHT UM TO LIGHT BULB
Line_698	THAT IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE WHAT YOU NEED ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND ON AND OF THE
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRI- ELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WITH IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVER REALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE BLUE BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT BULGING GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS ER BULBS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO GO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	IT HAD THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE KNOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR A THAT ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK ON
Line_707	LIGHT UP REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU DIS ATTACH N THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BA CORAL IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S ITS
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NOW BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE ENERGY FROM THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATTERY
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY AS THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW THE WAY
Line_714	IT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING USEMENT AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WELL LEARN ABOUT YESTER
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCH IT'
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE BAT
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPEN UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY COULD WORK THE SUNS ENERGY AND ENER- ELECTRICITY THAT YOU COULD N
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WORE IT WOULD NOT TURN THIS THE SUNS T
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF A SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET A TH
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY AN SCREW
Line_727	ONE IS A SCREW AND IT MUST BE A SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PAH PAPER CLIP IS COMPLETING THIS CIRCUIT
Line_729	ICTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRANE STICK IS MAKING DIFFERENT SO IT'S STILL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRASHED STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALL OF IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR FOR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS THAT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE ITS STEAL IN NOT COMPLETING
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARAL R PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	FOR A BELT THE LIGHT BUMBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SHARING ONE BIG ONES
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A LI COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THE M
Line_743	THE THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY BY GOING TOE DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GOING TO ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOOD CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	COMES FROM THE COM PRO AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE YOU WEIGHT NO POSITIVE SID
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING ER THE D CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT IT CAN BULB ON THE OTHER
Line_751	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEMSELVES THAT'S HARD BEEN USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND IT'S A LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS HAD ARE HELP USE SOME THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY S
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL A VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING B
Line_754	YOU UH GOOD
Line_755	THEY'RE THEY'RE NORMALLY USED AT CRISMESS TO DECORATE MS TREES AND HOUSES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRING BURNOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT ITS
Line_758	A PARALLEL A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF A BULB DOES AT THE WHOLE LIKE THE WHOLE THING GOES D ENOUGH TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB RUNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	HE BULB WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL IT BOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEEDED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE OTHER BULBS SAY ARE AND THAT ONES STANDING WHEN THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHERS BURN
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEY'RE GOING IN ALL THE IN AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST OF EM STAY LIGHT
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILL AND IN THE FILAMENT IN THE BULB WITH THE FILL HEADS BROKEN
Line_769	ELLIMENT IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IT'S FIN
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RUNNING BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR CAUSE THEIR THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YARN A COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS WON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL CAR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK ISN'T REMOVE
Line_777	HAND STEEL ONLY IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE
Line_778	IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCK HAS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOOD BLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULLS IT TO THE MAGNETS
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TEN AND THE OTHER ONE'S MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_783	IT WILL STICK CAUSE IT HAS TRACES OF ELECTIRON
Line_784	THE HOOD BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK UM THE BLACK RO
Line_785	IT WELL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR A STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIP
Line_786	THERE'S IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST RE INFORICE
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD STAPPATRACTING AND THEY WOULD REP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE IT QUICK THE OTHER MAGNET S JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OBVIOUSLY ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES RIPL
Line_791	ING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE'S USING A COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE'S GOING RIGHT NOW HE'S GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE EARTH NORTH POLES
Line_794	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT SEES PREVIINETS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY INTERACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRAENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECT
Line_797	MAGNETISM ONLY HAS A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BELONG THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TO IT'S TOO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO A BIG STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM BUT IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	SO IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW N IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY ARE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONE'S
Line_802	IT'S IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHEN IT COMES OFF THEN NAIL STOPS BEING A MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU U WHEN YOU DRINK THE THE MAGNET OFF IT STOPS DOING A MAGNET AND THE PAPERCLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	ITS TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_807	TAKES THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	B CAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	EA- MAGNETISM
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SOLECTS STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	M MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH SUCH STICK THAT IS STACK
Line_814	TELLING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
Line_815	A BAG NIFTY
Line_816	UH THERE IS ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISM BRAKES BECAUSE IT IT'S TO STRONG THE WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY HID ANOTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THE MAGNETISM ONES WEAKER LE THROUGH THAT THROUGH THOSE SPACERS S
Line_819	IT MUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIGHT IT
Line_820	THE BAR PLATES SAW MAGNET TOIZIELM B
Line_821	I GOOD NO TIS UHM
Line_822	MY IT WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER WEAK
Line_823	BALLS
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DECREASES IT'
Line_826	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC PULLWEAKER
Line_827	T GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT IT STOPS EATING ELECTRIELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM IT DISAPPEARES
Line_831	IS A D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH IS A RIVET WIRES UH THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT WORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET T
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE THE THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE MIDDAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAGNETISM GETS
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE COVERING A MOTOR IT'S ONLY IT HAS TO BE FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND CIRCLES TEL IT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	ITS BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH EASILY CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW IT CAN'T BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED MAYBE IT MAGNIFIES
Line_840	A SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT'S MAGNETID UP TO TH THE RIVET
Line_842	A ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICITY IN MAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON IN STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THEN IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
Line_845	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO THE MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	FIT MEANS
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT ON THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINGING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOL SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	E ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THEY POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IT THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	ITS STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_864	SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SO
Line_865	THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TOO MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY Y
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO IT ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	THE ENERGY WON'T THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY ARE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VOICE OKAY
Line_875	I I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE B
Line_877	S IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	L LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING CAUSE A WAX DOESN'T MAKE IT
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE A FILM BLMBLM BLMABLM BLM B
Line_883	THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DELICIOUS S
Line_884	THERE WILL BE SMOKE OR STEAM
Line_885	IT GETS FALGY OR SMOKE
Line_886	I I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I I'VE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_889	I'M NOT SURE COULD YOU HELPS ME WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_894	UH SORRY UM THERE IS ONE D CELL A TWO BULB
Line_895	IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GOES GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_898	IT'S GLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION MA GAS DO NOT GET THE CONCEPT
Line_900	OH UHM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK IN
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS ELING ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THE IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT WHEN IT'S AND THE BASE AND THE CASING THEN IT'S THERE OKAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT YEAH
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IR
Line_905	WHEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE ITS MAGNETIC FORCES
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY NEAR THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	NO IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES WHAT ELSE WOULD IT STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	BIT STICKS
Line_914	BE CAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METAL HOLE
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SCIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCES AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE UPON
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THAT IT'S NORTH THE SOUTH OR SOUTH THEN NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXCEPT FOR THE BO THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLDS
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPASS TO FIND HER WAYS AROUND
Line_926	I I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSER OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS PICKING A IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHER
Line_930	S IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY SPIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY SICK THEN IT CAN'T
Line_932	UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY'RE NOT CLOSER ENOUGH SO THEY CAN'T STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	ENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	THERE'S UM THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THE NA
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	ITS TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE ONTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	TH MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	IT A THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHILE THE NAIL IS ON THERE ON MEAN WHILE THE MAGNET'S ON THERE
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFORMING ONTO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT'S M
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION IT'S TOO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNETS
Line_946	WELL WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROKE THE MAGNET
Line_947	THERE ARE NOT WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SIX PACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER IT'LL LICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER AND THERE'S MORE SPACE THAN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEARS
Line_952	S YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MIXES THE FORCE WEAKER THE FORCE ON BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU'RE AN FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT THE L
Line_956	I SEE CANDLE MY PACE IT'S IN THE FIRE
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SURE REALLY I WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_958	H IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	H THE FIRE BURNING IS PROOF THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	E ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRINGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNET I MEAN MADE OUT OF METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_964	REFRIGERATE DOSE THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THINGS LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON IMPOSSIBLE METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS UH STEEL NAIL WAS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THEY ARE BOTH MADE AH STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WHIT ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	ITS THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PREY HOW PRAYS LIKE METAL ON THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INSIDE
Line_971	THE IRON AND OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	S IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNIE
Line_974	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW CIRCUITS MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THE WIRE BOTH THE LIGHT
Line_976	WIRE BATTERY AND A
Line_977	THE WIRES LIKE THEY MAKE ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FROM ANOTHER SO
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED UH WIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WIRES UM UM CARRY
Line_980	IT PROVIDES UM HOW THE L
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKES A HUM
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WATER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_983	IT WILL SET OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL UM UM IT
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CAN ELECTRICITY SO UM THE LIGHT BULB LI
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UM TO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITIES HO THE BATTERIES CA THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECEIVING THE THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE EDGY FROM TH
Line_988	IT'S FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THE
Line_989	THE PARTS THAT THE ENERGY IS FULL OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT UM THE ELECTRICITY
Line_991	ITS SLIPPED OVER SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU SLIP IT T IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BA
Line_994	THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE UM ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULBS LIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BUT BY UM THE D CELL
Line_997	THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BACK TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELLS
Line_998	THE BATTERY DOES TO BE THE BATTERY BRINGS ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTIVE FROM THE W
Line_999	CAN IT REPEATED THAT IT
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PICTURE IS SO LIKE IT TURNED IT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTOR GETS UHM SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLOSING
Line_1003	I NOTICED THAT UM THE UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM I SPENDS AND UM
Line_1004	IT CAN YOU REPICKETHOUT IT
Line_1005	H IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE MOTOR YET BUT WHEN I CLOSE IT IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T MOVE OR IT DOESN'T MAKE THE ELECTRICITY UM FLOW TO THE MOTOR MY CORE
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T O GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLID POWDER IS COLLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COLD
Line_1009	WON'T BRING ELECTRICITY IN TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR WOULD SPIN
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPINS THE S
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO COMPLETE A MOST COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDLE P
Line_1013	H I DON'T KNOW
Line_1014	AH
Line_1015	I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT A
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARTS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOTORS RUN
Line_1017	OH KAY BYE MONEY WELL IT'S THAT YOU NEAR
Line_1018	I I'M DOING BAD TODAY
Line_1019	WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME ABOUT HOW I'M FEELING
Line_1020	UH YOU JUST I MEAN I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES DO SO ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHARGER LIKE TRICKS AND HAVE LI
Line_1026	I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	SLIGHT ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DOES N LIKE ANYTHING JUST WHAT S
Line_1029	I COULD SEE THAT THE HEAT ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAH Y
Line_1030	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
Line_1031	WEN UM ACTUALLY DOING PARTY GOD
Line_1032	UH WE IT'S BEEN DOING UM OWL
Line_1033	A IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOTS OF M ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UH CAN WE PEEL THAT AGAIN
Line_1036	UH CAN YOU EAT THAT POLIECE
Line_1037	THERE IS WE UM SOLVENT
Line_1038	THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU ADD MORE D CELLS THEN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AS THE TIME YOU ADD MORE D CELLS
Line_1040	UM ONE BATTERY ON E
Line_1041	THE ONE D CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU HAVE A ON EDGE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTS TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE HAVE A GOOD DAYS
Line_1044	CIRCUIT'S
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NOW
Line_1047	ITS
Line_1048	IT'S IT'S JUST THE USE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY UM WON'T WELL DONE
Line_1050	THEY SERVE YOU A LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO LIGHT
Line_1051	E ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINE'S SINCE
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWS IN THE UM PLUS SIGN AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS CELL
Line_1055	MOLECULES OR ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE MITTAL BULL S OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKAY HEAPS OF FINE
Line_1057	THE MINE'S SINCE
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING I MARNEY
Line_1059	ITS WOULDN'T START IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	EITHER WAY YOU CLICK ONE WIRES OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT
Line_1062	I WAS BUILDING A CIRCUIT STILL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND INTO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND THAT IT IS ON AND THEN THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY WELL
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NON RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT NEXT TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS LEANING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT'S WELL METAL AND IT IT'S LIKE ELECTRIC LYING TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	SIT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I CLICK A IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE THE FLAG AS ON FLOWING IT'S AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEX GUNS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	E ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PANEL AND A IN THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SIERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WOULDN'T SERVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S OWN
Line_1080	IT TURNS SETS OFF IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOTHING'S HAPPENING
Line_1084	O TWO MORE IS STEER LATER HAVE A GOOD DID TOO BYE
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACER
Line_1087	ELECTRI- UM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD WORK B
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING A L JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH ON THE WIRES
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT WON'T IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTIC IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD RIGHT THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTE IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S A PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANY THING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THE CONDUCTORS ARE A THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS A
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICKED THEN THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTORS STARTED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND AN SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE THE HEAT AND THE IT'S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGHT AND IT TO PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE A STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	SLIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU I CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE WIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE THE PLASTIC AND IT'S SOUNDS
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WILL SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
Line_1111	APPLES
Line_1112	THE FUEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THERE WILL BE SWEETER
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE AIR HOT AND SMOKE COMES FILLS THE AIR
Line_1115	THE SOLID ONE L
Line_1116	GAS WOOD WINDMILLS SOLID PANELS
Line_1117	BECAUSE THE BULB SERVE ENERGY
Line_1118	WERE BOTH ENERGY IN UM AND THEY BOTH SERVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BULB AR FEUWAL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SERMENY THEY JUST GET SMOKE AND THE GASES MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_1121	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLO PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GAS DOESERT
Line_1123	THEY SERVE AS MEAT AND WELL VIEW IN BREE
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE LIGHT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IT LIGHTING UP
Line_1127	THEY'RE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILAMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	E ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW ANYWHERE JUST WHERE ENERGY ITS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT WILL WORK LIKE A SWITCH LOT CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	SO IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET DOLLAR
Line_1134	THEY RUB THEY ONE GETS RIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLICKED IT AGAIN THE STOPPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE ASING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BE SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	UH I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF STUFF UH MUGNETS
Line_1140	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	DA PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONCEARNING EVERY
Line_1143	I ONLY KNEW A MOMENT NOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FILL MA
Line_1145	UHM HOW WELL I KNOW
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAYS FASTER
Line_1148	I I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE BATTERIES AMID THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON INSIDE S
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONES WITH THE FORE WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WE E HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT OH AN INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRES
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
Line_1160	STRING OF LIGHTS ARE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1161	IT'S KI LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DINE
Line_1163	WIRES AND A BATTERY AND UP
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEGAL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DOING
Line_1166	THE FILAMENT DIED
Line_1167	THE FILAMENT DID ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILLMAN DIES AND THE WEIGHT IN THE WEIGHT
Line_1169	A FILL MEAN DOING ON A BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDESENT CIRCUITS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE REST
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILAMENT ISN'T LYING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILAMENT BREAKES AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS M
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINUS SIGN AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
Line_1174	AN AND COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	IT THE FILAMENT IS DOING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT'S
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND COANESCENT CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
Line_1179	GOOD HOW MA YOU
Line_1180	I MEAN SO WELL NO LAS MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH SO THERE ARE NOT TO BE OPPOSITE SO I CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE ATTRACTING SO THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	BECAUSE IT'S STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	ONE OF THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WOOD ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL APE THES IT
Line_1187	BEC BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD IS NOT
Line_1188	THEY'RE BOTH METALS
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS A NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND D
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SOM
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL IT WILL FIT IN AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS A LOT OF TOOLS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TONS
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	TWO STONE
Line_1198	THESE ARE MAGNETI THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNETS THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKES A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEEDS TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW W WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT ALL STOPS AND IT DOES FALL AND IT DOLL FILL
Line_1205	NON MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BUILD UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED THAT HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	I NEED WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETS THREE WIRES AND A BAT
Line_1209	FLIES AND HOLES THE MA
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIE
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVET STOPPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPPED AND THE MAGNETS
Line_1212	UM A ER
Line_1213	OPEN BEING CLOSED
Line_1214	TE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNETS BY THE RIVET
Line_1215	HA TRICITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGNIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT T
Line_1218	RE AND WIRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BATTERY AND THE MAGNET
Line_1219	CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB ON
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS TH THE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT TURN
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOKED TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTORS
Line_1224	END THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GO THROUGH
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1226	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE THAT'S RECEIVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BACK
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSES
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL TOWARDS THE THE POS THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE
Line_1231	I I WAS ABSENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PANELS AND HOW I A SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING FRICTION AND HEAT AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR AND MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICED THAT ALL THE PIECES ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	IN INSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTIC ABOUT THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS ER INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS CONDUCT
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRIC
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND IN ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORK AND WITHOUT ENERGY IT NO THING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS L
Line_1242	YEAH YOU HEAR A LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TYPE OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BURNING
Line_1245	WHEN YOU PUT THE HANDS POW- ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EACH HE'S GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOODS SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALK
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEAR A NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRLS EATING AND SCARING HER ENERGY SO THAT SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE VERY GOOD A BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PULLS THE AIR THE AIR GETS DIRTY AND NOT GOOD YOU FOR YOU TO BREATHE IN
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKE
Line_1252	THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STORE IT
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COAL ARE SOMER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND GLASS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THEM
Line_1255	COAL AND GAS WOULD HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON THE IRON BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BRING
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW A THAT YOUR
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF THINGS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1258	HE ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FROM THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVEMENT ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE W
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1262	THE D'S MOVING REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE IS ONE PATH THE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIES SET
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH A
Line_1265	BYE MORSE
Line_1266	VERY WELL HOW ABOUT
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICED THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE IS TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOW GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
Line_1274	THE ENDS IN THE BATTERY WHERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES IT JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE E OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULBING GOES INTO THE POSITI-
Line_1276	I NOTICED THAT THE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS U
Line_1277	OU UH HOW YOU GET
Line_1278	LIGHT BULB WIRES AND WIRES AND AND THE BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY WEIGH THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOURCE IS THE SAME DIG
Line_1281	WELL IT'S THE SAME THING
Line_1282	A ENERGY
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHITE DR
Line_1284	WILL THEY LIGHT UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THIS WIG THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT UP AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE GOT ON
Line_1286	KITTY CAL LINED AGAIN
Line_1287	ITS IS GOING TO THE LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING LIKE THE SAME
Line_1289	THEY'RE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENTLY
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST Y AND THEN IT CHANGES YELLOW SO IT CHANG
Line_1291	I LOOK AT A C NEXT
Line_1292	WE HAVE BEEN DOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GO IN
Line_1293	WELL THE GREY K IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BAT
Line_1294	IT IS A L BECAUSE MOTOR THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE ABOUND IN
Line_1297	ITS IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I I DON'T THAT
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE IN ENERGY FROM THE BAT
Line_1300	THE THE FLAG MOVED
Line_1301	THE FLAG STARTS MOVING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN IT'LL START THE FLAG WILL START
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH IT'S THE WIRES THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG T
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DONE YET
Line_1306	THE GREAT PEACE WITH IT SUNNY
Line_1307	WELL C A CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU CLICK THE S
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVE
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS WALKING THE FLAG STUPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UH
Line_1312	I SEE THE FLAG MOVE MIN
Line_1313	THE THE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTE
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THATS MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THE UM WIRE AND THE SWI-
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOSER
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE SO THE STICK
Line_1319	ITS IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	OH I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WE WERE LEARNING TH
Line_1321	O CA SO THE PLASTIC K
Line_1322	THE STEEL MET THE STEEL A
Line_1323	YOU TOO BYE MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUITS
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND ITS TOUCHING THE WIRES AND THE FLAG IS LUNG BY THE R
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH AND THE WIRES
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT IS METAL
Line_1329	IT STOPS UH IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UH SOR
Line_1331	YOU'RE MARNEY I
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CHANNEL AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STICK PLAIN IT'S GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MELT THE CAN
Line_1334	BECAUSE D WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE
Line_1335	IT MOUNTS CAUSE OF THE FIRE IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S A LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT WE CAN'T SO THAT IT'S IRONY
Line_1337	NO BUT I COULD NOT SAVE THAT THING
Line_1338	IT WAS A SOLVENT IT WAS FIRED
Line_1339	IN THE CAKE IF THE ENERGY OFF BE WAIT
Line_1340	IT MAKES A SOUND SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	EH
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GAS BOBLE APPLES AND A FIRE
Line_1343	MEAL WIRE APPLE WOOD BLACK STUFF AND A L
Line_1344	IT GOES IN IT ON
Line_1345	THE SOLID WE USE Y AND I
Line_1346	IT
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT IS A
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN MARKING MAGNET
Line_1349	UH THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STRAIGHT ONE IS HARVED AND THE ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	THEY IT'S CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIRREFRIGERAT OR
Line_1352	L IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE MATTIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNIC AND SO THE FRUGERATOR IS MAG
Line_1354	WELL THAT THIS THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE W
Line_1355	THEY IS TO GO BECAUSE THAT UH THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MAG THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE THIS SCREW
Line_1357	WELL A TRACHICIDY DOSE BUT A AT DOESN'T T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1359	DOUBLE BANDS UH
Line_1360	BEECH IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1361	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
Line_1364	BECAUSE WHAT HAS IRON IT DOESN'T
Line_1365	IT
Line_1366	IT WEILL YEAH
Line_1367	E ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A D
Line_1369	THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WASTE THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL AND THE PLUS SIDE
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO IT'S NORMAL SHAPED
Line_1373	I NOTICED THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSH
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EACH END
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS SAVING IT'S LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK I NEED METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD UHM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR A TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF TRICITY FOR A PIECE OF AND NO J
Line_1381	HILL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
Line_1382	INSULATORS ARE ARE HELPFUL L
Line_1383	IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ER
Line_1384	SON
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN THE REPEAT THAT
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX I IT'S MELTING
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND DROPPED I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKES
Line_1390	IT'S HEADING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING THE
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUT YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOCUSED UM THE SOUNDS AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HERS FEET
Line_1393	UM IT SHE IS GETTING IN TA ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS E
Line_1394	THE APPLES AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PEN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE GAS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	FROM BECAUSE THE COAL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE GAS HAS INT- I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MOUNT THE EARTH WE'LL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREES AND EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT A REMRULT
Line_1400	IT IS A COMPLETE TORMATOR A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_1401	WELL UM I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOR THERE IS FOR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	T I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO UM D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORT OF ENERGY SO IT WOULD WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK THE WORK MAYBE A
Line_1405	LE MEAN KI YOU HURRIED UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS WORD AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY T LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES IT'S A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR AND WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UH I P
Line_1413	THAT WHEN THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE
Line_1414	STILL THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE I'M SEEN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT A
Line_1416	MADDY WE COULD SWITCH IT FOR A NO ONE
Line_1417	I THINK THAT'S THE BATTERY
Line_1418	DA BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHILE YOU ARE TALKING AND I'M SICK
Line_1419	UP STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	WOOD A STRING LIGHT EEE PARTY
Line_1421	WIRES HOLDS LIKE THE ENERGY IN STUFF
Line_1422	WELL IT WON'T WORK MOR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE THE ENERGY IS HOLD AT
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALREADY DRIED OUT IN STUFF
Line_1424	I I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SAY THE WARM
Line_1426	OH MARD AND CAN I PLEASE JUST FIT YOU
Line_1427	I BUM BROKE AND THE TH
Line_1428	IT WON'T BROKE SO IT DIDN'T WORK SO THAT I HAS TO CHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER
Line_1429	WE SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PAPER
Line_1430	WON'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STUDIED IT'S THE WORK
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THAT ELECTRICITY TO ON THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UM IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE
Line_1433	FRO GA IT DOESN'T LIGHT AND WORK
Line_1434	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A COUPLE OF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ME
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKES ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO IN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GO THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP FLOW POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING THROUGH
Line_1440	POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCES
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASHLIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEIVES POWER AND FROM THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND NEVER M
Line_1444	I NOTICED THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO TO
Line_1445	UH WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S I DIDN'T INVENT ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE BY THE WAY
Line_1450	THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE M
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING AS POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIR
Line_1453	AND SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ONTO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRE'S
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	UM THAT THE PERSON WHO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER SOURCES POWER
Line_1459	UHM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN OR
Line_1460	IT ALL HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
Line_1461	H WHENEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
Line_1462	THE HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHT WAY
Line_1463	UM WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT THEM MEA BECAUSE THE PATH THE WE GOT THE LAID BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK OR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS T
Line_1466	WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE TAPES OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_1467	SWITCH AND ME A WOMEN A NAIL OR
Line_1468	UH D CELL THE ATRIUM THE OLD SLITCHED METAL AND OR
Line_1469	THE SWITCH THE METAL TH
Line_1470	UM WELL IT'S TOUCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METAL IS IN
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKES A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	THERE'S NOTHING REALLY ELSE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST WON
Line_1473	IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOT
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND WE
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS THE LIGHT LETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF THE
Line_1477	THE FLAME GLARS OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_1478	IT BURNS THE WAX IT MELTS S
Line_1479	IT'S SOUNDED CAN LIKE POPPING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOMEBODY'S HITTING THE BONGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENER
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRYING AND THAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DUST A FAN TREE BRANCHES RAISINS AND FUEL
Line_1483	IT GIVES MORE AIR BECAUSE OF THE IT THE
Line_1484	THE FIRE COULD THE FIRE COULD PULL EACH AIR AND THEN
Line_1485	IT HAS A A BIG IMPACT AND THAT EFFECTS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S ON AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HI
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A FAN AND THE MO
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH OURSELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR UH IT CAN HURT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	UM THE FRONT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINE S
Line_1494	THOSE ARE THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND TH
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FALL THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF IT GETS STUCK IT WORK
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHTS ARE A
Line_1497	IT WILL GET REALLY LIGHT AND WEIGHS
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAY BE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNS BATTERIES NOT REALLY QUITE
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN UH CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHERS
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE ON BOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRIGH
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERIES- SERIES CIRCUITS HAVE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE SHE
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT LIGHTS THE BULB THEN I THINK THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE CIR
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILM BRAKES IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYMORE
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKS
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS TOP NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE'S SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON A DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STICKS TO
Line_1513	THE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
Line_1514	NOTHING HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO E
Line_1515	BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHEN ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CIRCUITS OR IT CAN FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
Line_1516	TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER LIGHT YOU'RE TRYING TO POWER YUP
Line_1517	ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D CELL GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER IT UP AND BACKS THROUGH THE REAR END OF THE D
Line_1518	FOR ENERGY TO GO DIRECTLY TO A LIGHT BULB AND MAKE IT LIGH
Line_1519	THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THROUGH THE BATTERY BACK TO THE NEGATIVE SO
Line_1520	THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIMALLE PATHWAYS IN THE CENORY ES AND INSTEAD OF A
Line_1521	THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER BOTH ON THE LIGHT
Line_1522	I I DON'T EAT KNOW
Line_1523	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT MORE
Line_1524	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTER
Line_1525	THE BULBS WON'T BE THAT THAT DOESN'T
Line_1526	THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
Line_1527	PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT WE
Line_1528	THAT THE D CELLS DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY

Line_1532	UH IT'S ALL ONE BIG SIDE
Line_1533	THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THEY'RE ALL ON THEIR ENDS
Line_1534	A STEEL A STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DON'T BRING MAGN-
Line_1535	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MAGNETIC
Line_1536	WOOD YARN AND CARPET
Line_1537	THE ONES THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET YOU STICK TO IT THE ONES THAT DON'T IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT STICK TO TO IT IT'LL U
Line_1538	THE WEIGHT NAIL ISN'T A MAGNETIC THAT MAGNETIC FORCE SO IT'S NOT STICKING TO T
Line_1539	THE ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A M MAGNET THAT ISN'T A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT WILL STICK TO A MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
Line_1540	IT HAS TO BE EITHER METAL OR IRON
Line_1541	ITS MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED IN STEEL
Line_1542	I THINK THEY HAS SOME KIND OF WARM IN IT
Line_1543	OR HAND IRON
Line_1544	THAT THERE IS ONLY
Line_1545	THAT THEY'RE ARE BOTH LIGHTING
Line_1546	THAT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE ONES ON THE THE ONE ON THE
Line_1547	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT MORE OR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO I DON'T
Line_1548	THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE IT UH WOULD LIGHT
Line_1549	THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS TO POWER THEM UP AND GOING BACK THROUGH THE D
Line_1550	THAT THEY ARE POWERING UM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1551	THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH WAYS THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
Line_1552	ONE WELL EAT TWO
Line_1553	THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB IS KEEPS BURNING OUT
Line_1554	THAT THERE ARE UH MORE THAN ONE D CELL
Line_1555	THAT THEY ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE OTHERS ONES
Line_1556	THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THERE ARE S
Line_1557	THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT LIGHTING AND I
Line_1558	BE CAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE CIRCUIT
Line_1559	THAT SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY A ONE PATHWAY
Line_1560	THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONE
Line_1561	THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1562	THAT THE BULBS ARE BURNING OUT
Line_1563	THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1564	THAT OF FILAMENT IS BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT A LIGHT
Line_1565	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
Line_1566	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL S NOT WORK
Line_1567	THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINUE
Line_1568	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1569	THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THAT'LL WELL BURN OUT QUICKLY
Line_1570	THAT WHEN ONE FILAMENT BRAKES THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLE STILL CONTINUE
Line_1571	THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY OR
Line_1572	THAT THE FILAMENT BRACE AND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING IT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
Line_1573	SERIOUS IT WAIT IT WEIGHS TO HIT FULL
Line_1574	I THE UM FILLOW MIGHT BREAK
Line_1575	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
Line_1576	E ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
Line_1577	THAT THEY ARE A MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE A NORTH COAL THE SOUTH
Line_1578	THAT THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE WILL BRAKE THEM APART
Line_1579	THAT THEY STICKS TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FORCE BRINGS THEM TOGETHER
Line_1580	THAT PUT MAG THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
Line_1581	BECAUSE IT IS A METAL AND IT'S STICKING TO A MAGNET INSTEAD OF A MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THE NAIL
Line_1582	THAT IT IS A METAL
Line_1583	WOOD GRASS DARKER
Line_1584	THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NAIL WOULD UH STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1585	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1586	BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT UM METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT'S THE MAGNETS STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER OR OTHER WILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE STEEL OR ONE STEEL AND ONE IS A PAPER
Line_1590	I DIED
Line_1591	THAT IT TRICKED
Line_1592	STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_1593	THAT IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER IT CAN NOT STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1594	BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1595	STEEL OR METAL OR A
Line_1596	THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT IT COULD STICK AND NOT STICK ON TO THEM AND THEN NORTH POLE AN SOUTH POLE
Line_1597	GOT IT WOULD BE THAT
Line_1598	THEY HAVE OTHER METAL IN THEM WHICH UH MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT TO
Line_1599	THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL IN IT
Line_1600	THAT THEY'RE MAGNETS ON CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1601	THAT'S THE MAGNET MAGNETS MAGNET I DON'T KNOW
Line_1602	THAT ONE STACK IS BIGGER THAN ANOTHER SO THE MAGNET CAN GO S ONE OR OTHER
Line_1603	ICOARLE
Line_1604	THAT THE MAGNET CAN NOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET SO THAT STICK A PAPER
Line_1605	THAT'S A MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE UM MAGNETS
Line_1606	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE AND IT WELL IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THEN ALL THE MAGNET GETS TAKING OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS ON
Line_1611	W WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
Line_1612	MATE WHEN IT GETS STOOD NINETEEN WASHERS AND BACKED IT TO UM BRAKE
Line_1613	TH AT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
Line_1614	TH SPACERS WE'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN- TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY DIFFERENT S ARE NEED TO TAKE THE
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNETS
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER
Line_1619	IT TOOK NINE SPACERS TO BRING THE MAGNETS APART T
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO WRAP IT AROUND THE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_1622	THAT THE WIRES WRAP WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIBET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE IT LIKE STICK TO THE RIB
Line_1623	SOIT PRODUCES ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRIES LIKE MAGNETISM FORCE SO IT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METAL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET IT CAN CARRY METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THAT THE ELECTRI- ELECTRO MAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IT IS NOT AN ELECTROMAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IS THE ELECTROMAGNET COULD IT IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_1631	IT STARTS TO PICK UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSE
Line_1633	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	BE WRAPPED AROUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGNE
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BUL
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT BALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELP UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A A REALLY BIG TOOL TO USE
Line_1639	UM I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE UM IT'S A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
Line_1640	UH I THINK WHAT TRAVELS AND WIRES IS ENERGY TO TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROUM OR ANYTHING THAT NEEDS LIGHT AND DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGHT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEEE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I COULD THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVEN'T O
Line_1645	GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLUS
Line_1646	I THINK THE PLUOCTS REPRESENT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINE SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONENTS COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BY MARNEY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE A GREAT HELP
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO THROW FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL AND INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES
Line_1652	E ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE A
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND NOTICED THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING IT
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOP
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	UN IS GIVING THE CELL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG S
Line_1660	THINK IT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WASTE ENERGY AND WELL IT DOESN'T WASTE
Line_1661	I I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE CIRCUIT
Line_1664	THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THE WIRES INTO THE TO MAKE THE FLAG T
Line_1665	YOU TOO MARNEY THANK YOU BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS AROUND AND A
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE DIFFERENT STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTIVE
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAIL
Line_1670	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT F THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN NOT
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE UM MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL SO THAT WILL NOT WORK
Line_1674	THEN THING'S OPEN MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING TROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1677	CLOSE MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE ANYTHING METAL THAT CORE CAN CREATE FROM ENERGY OR ELECTRIC
Line_1679	I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNIE I HAD A REALLY GREAT TON
Line_1681	GOOD GOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW WERE YOU
Line_1683	I HAVE THE D OH I'M FORGOT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DON'T TE
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT A CIRCUITS
Line_1685	I FORGOT SOLVENTLY
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY LIKE IT LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND FLAMING INTO EVERYTHING IT
Line_1688	IT'S FALLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT THE WE
Line_1689	THE BLUE THOUGHTS OR THE UH ELECTRICITY MAYBE
Line_1690	THEY CONNECT ME ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THE LITER REMINDED ME OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	ME PORTION IS THAT IT GOES ABSOLUTELY D CAIL AND GOES IN ACID LIGHT A BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THAT'S METAL IN THE LIGHT B
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULD BE MORE MUD AND THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1695	MORBLE BULBS UHM MEANS LESS THAN LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILL RE AND THAT THE NOLARY GOE
Line_1697	I THINK THAT LIGHT BULBS WOULD LIKE RIGHT I
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WITH ONE D CAIL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT THE ONE WILL DO THESE IS IS VERY VARY BIG
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL
Line_1700	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GUESS
Line_1702	AT THE OH DOTHOS IN I WILL MISS YO
Line_1703	I I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT IS NOT ACT SLOWLY UH NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRES MEANS SPREAD YOUR LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	IRE DREAMING DON'T KNOW
Line_1707	I OH THINK THAT THE I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB LIE DIM
Line_1708	I NOTICED IT BEARS AND LOWING THROUGH ALL OF THE M
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE PATHWAYS MAYBE
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS COULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	UM I REMEMBER THAT UM IT GOES OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SO
Line_1713	E I THINK IT IS SWOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE S
Line_1714	I I NOTICE THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1716	UM I DON'T ILY
Line_1717	I NOTICED THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS MORE WIRES
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE WELL I DON'T KNOW
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	UM I SEE THAT A TOP OR WORK
Line_1721	IT THINKS THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT THI ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOOD BECAUSE IT'S THEY'RE BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_1724	I AM LEARNING UH
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT THE SWITCH IS NOT ON THE VITORINGLY SO IT THE LABORS NOT LIGHT
Line_1726	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT PRODUCT A PERMITS
Line_1727	M I THINK THAT THEN THE BULB WILL NOT THE LIGHT YOU WON
Line_1728	I BULL HE MAD UM DAY U UM
Line_1729	UM THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT LIGHT AND UP FOR CUTRICMATIC BULBS
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THAT THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LE BULB IS NOT LIGHTING OF QUART
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULB THEN
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILAMENT BRAKES THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT IT'S BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS LIGHTING BECAUSE THE ONE I BROKE
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT BECAUSE THE FILM BROKE SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOPS
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT COMES WHEN A BULB BREAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FUEL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	UM A PARALLEL MAIL
Line_1738	UM WHENEVER ONE BRAKES THE OTHER IT'S TE LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIRES
Line_1739	IN ORDER BULB WHATEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILLMENT BREAKS BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB ONE THE ENERGY COMPPOLITELY STOPS
Line_1741	UM I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER ONES STILL L
Line_1742	THIS PICTURE HAS TO DO WITH A BULB BURNING OUT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES IN
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1744	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T T
Line_1745	WHEN EVER ONE BULB BURNS UH THE OTHER ONE BREAKS OUT
Line_1746	S I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER HA ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	H WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRE'S ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	WHEN EVER THE FILAMENT BREAKS THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILLIMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	UH I THINK I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN LIGHT UH WIRE
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH ANT EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDE TH UM WHENEVER ONE FILAMENT BRAKES THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS
Line_1756	LECTRICITY STOPS THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I SAY I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT RELATES TO THE LOST WHEN I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT SEN
Line_1760	I THINK THE ELECT A ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT BRAKES AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	UM I KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UM I KNOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS HEAT ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	IT THINKS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	WHATEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANYTHING WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1769	MAGNET CAN ATTRACT ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRIDGE ITS EITHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	T ORDER FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY OVER MAY A STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL ON IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TIPPED OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	S STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS THERE'S FEUEL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE EITHER MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1780	I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1781	STEEL OR I RAN
Line_1782	MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
Line_1783	BATTERIES WIRE AND LIGHT
Line_1784	THEY MADE THE WOOD
Line_1785	I THINK IT HELPS THEM LIGHT LIGHT UP
Line_1786	IT WILL LIGHT UP THE BULB
Line_1787	THAT ANY RATE IT DIVIDES TO LIGHT
Line_1788	IT IT'S LIGHTING UP THE L
Line_1789	YOU'RE
Line_1790	IT FLOWS BY IT HAS LOT'S OF ENERGY
Line_1791	THE LIGHT
Line_1792	IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE EVOLVE TO MAKE IT LIGHT UP ON THE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE
Line_1793	IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT AND THEN INTO THE FLO
Line_1794	IT'S MOVING TO THE MINE'S SWIGH
Line_1795	IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
Line_1796	THE MINE'S
Line_1797	IT'S GIVING A OF ENERGY
Line_1798	TO THE
Line_1799	BIT DOESN'T LIGHT UP
Line_1800	T GIVE ENERGY
Line_1801	GIVING A POWER
Line_1802	IT I
Line_1803	IT WILL TURN IT TURNS ON
Line_1804	TO GIVE POWER SO
Line_1805	THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
Line_1806	THE SOLAR SISTIOM
Line_1807	IT WILL STOP

Line_1809	LEARNING I W
Line_1810	THE MOTORS MOVING
Line_1811	STRINING
Line_1812	THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE THE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER IT IT INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT STICK
Line_1813	WHEN YOU PUT THE SUNE ON IT IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1814	D CELL WIRES MILLA
Line_1815	IT'S MADE FROM ELECTRICITY AND
Line_1816	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T STI-
Line_1817	IT'S NOT METAL SO IT WON'T GIVE ENERGY
Line_1818	THE IT'S AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1819	THE SPONGE IS L AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1820	THEY ARE DIFFERENT CAUSE AR METAL AND SOME
Line_1821	IT'S METAL CELL UH THAT
Line_1822	IT FLOWED UH THAT WHEN YOU PUT METAL ONTO IT THE MOTOR WAS SOR
Line_1823	IT W IT WILL NOT SPIN
Line_1824	IT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT WON'T SNUCK
Line_1825	THOUGH NOT THOSE SPINS COULD IT METAL
Line_1826	THESE ARE CLOSED THEY ARE MAKES CAN ALL
Line_1827	UM
Line_1828	TO LIGHT A CANDLE LIT UP FROM
Line_1829	WE IT GOOD IS YOU HUH
Line_1830	IT'S A A CANDLE AND IT'S REALLY SCIENCE BECAUSE
Line_1831	IT'S MELTING
Line_1832	BECAUSE IT'S GIVING N
Line_1833	ITS
Line_1834	S THE WIND
Line_1835	JEMS
Line_1836	SHE IS EVENING SALTY FILL
Line_1837	IT'S GIVING POUNDS HERE
Line_1838	IT'S GIVING ITS
Line_1839	THE GIRL IS GIVING ENERGY IN HER BODY
Line_1840	I MEAN
Line_1841	HER BODIES
Line_1842	YOU SEE A CANDLE SOME
Line_1843	AND APPLES
Line_1844	IT WILL GET HURT
Line_1845	IT GETS IT GIVES A HEAT
Line_1846	I I DON'T BLOW
Line_1847	GIVING HEAT AND RE
Line_1848	THE PULSE
Line_1849	TO U
Line_1850	BECAUSE GAS WILL GIVES THE COAL ENERGY
Line_1851	BECAUSE BECAUSE IF ONE HAS AN RAIN ONE DOESN'T
Line_1852	BUT WE I I CAN NOT KNOW
Line_1853	SHE DID NOT KNOW
Line_1854	LET ENERGY
Line_1855	I WOULD CAN'T KNOW HOW IT'S A SOLUTE
Line_1856	LEARNING HOW TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THAT PICK
Line_1857	TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP
Line_1858	THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BUL
Line_1859	IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELLATIVE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT UP THROUGH THE WIRE
Line_1860	THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING A PATH WAY
Line_1861	THE D CELL HAS THE ELECTRICITY IN THERE SO IT COMES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE AND MIX INTO THE D CELL
Line_1862	NO IT MAKES
Line_1863	IT'S BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ENERGY
Line_1864	BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THAT THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHTBULBS
Line_1865	TH ENERGY
Line_1866	MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERGY
Line_1867	WHEN WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER D S IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
Line_1868	ANT A D CELL THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT LIGHTER SO MAKE IT SO UH MORE HEN
Line_1869	ONE DOES ONE LIGHT WELL THIS HAS A RED CIRCLE AROUND IT
Line_1870	BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
Line_1871	THE ENERGY OF THE GO PASS WELL PASS THROUGH
Line_1872	THE D CELLS ARE TO STUCK TOGETHER
Line_1873	OOD
Line_1874	MAGNETISMS E
Line_1875	WHEN ST AND O GO TOGETHER IT WILL L
Line_1876	IT'S REPELLING
Line_1877	IT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME
Line_1878	BECAUSE SA RAIN THEY'RE THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEN POTENT
Line_1879	AT MAGNETISM
Line_1880	HEY
Line_1881	WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING AND
Line_1882	IT'S IT'S GOIN
Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND YOU AND IT OFF THE LIGHT WON'T TURN
Line_1884	THEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT WRONG
Line_1885	IT WE'LL WEIGH UP
Line_1886	IT IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE ITS BROKEN
Line_1887	THAT IT'S TILL IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT'S K IT WILL CIRCLE
Line_1889	IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT BEEN ON TO ONE PROBABLY
Line_1890	ONE LIGHT RAN OFF RIGHT OUT AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT B
Line_1891	ITS ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTING
Line_1892	WE'LL STOP THE
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY SOURCES
Line_1894	IT'S UM WHEN IT IS RA OUTS
Line_1895	THIS A CIRCUIT LIGHT CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL START
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WOULD STOP ON ITS
Line_1899	BE CAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NOTHING HAPPEN ING
Line_1901	IT'S CAUSE IT S
Line_1902	ECAUSE IT THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS RAN OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND RE
Line_1904	WHEN YOU DO NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT WHEN YOU DO SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WON'T
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON ONE SIDE AND TH OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	I S WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRUIT
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MAG
Line_1909	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN SIDE IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT'S IRON INSIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FOUND A HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
Line_1913	IOR HAS IRON AND THE MAGNET DUST IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS
Line_1915	MAGNET STICKS TO IRON
Line_1916	ITS BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOES HAVE
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON- AND ONE DOESN'T
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON ON IT
Line_1919	THE NEIL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NOT METAL
Line_1923	AT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	BIT ATTRACTS IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BE CAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DIDN'T
Line_1927	THAT IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE CREATING CIRACIAT
Line_1929	THE D CELL IS IT A CERTAINACRITY THE R CELL
Line_1930	BECAUSE WE ARE ALL THE WIRE IT'S LOW D L ABOUT AN ELECTRICITY AND THE LIKE IN MAKE THE RID SHAKER
Line_1931	THAT ELECTRICITY IT'S GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	A CELL HAS TO BE HARD TO CHU WIRES TO GO WITH FRY TO GO ALL ELECTRICITY TO GO INTO
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TELL BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT PRE OTHER CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLATTERY
Line_1935	O METAL CERAL TO THE IRON SO AND IT ELECTRICITY TO GET A ROUGH
Line_1936	IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH D CELL AND IT WILL TURN EL THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE UM
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING THE SO THEN IT IT WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES THEN IT WILL BURN AND THE FLAG BURN
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT LIFTER
Line_1942	IT WOULD'VE WORKED CACPY SUNNY AND WHY HO THINK IT ER
Line_1943	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG OR
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1945	PRODUCERS ELECTRICITY MAKE UH
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE WIDE AND IT IS A HEAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEEN AND THE BARNY
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL IN THE WAIT TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1949	IT'S HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IN FLAT TO
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITCH
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	THE SWITCH PASS THE OFF
Line_1953	IT DOESN'T WAN
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SUCKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE CELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTI ON THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1956	THEY WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY ONE
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1958	IT DOESN'T WORK
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	T MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING A CIRCUITS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1963	LTRICICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE MITALA IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT UP
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	HAS TO MAKE A PAS WHEN YOU CONNECTED IT
Line_1969	IT LIKE THE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT UM IT GOES BACK
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO A LIGHTBULB
Line_1971	IT HA HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK IN TO THE POSIT
Line_1974	NOW IT'S GOING THE WAY BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED AROUND IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH A LITTLE LIGHT BULB
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA THE TWO BASES OF THE BULB IT DOT WOULDN'T WOR CAUSE THE WIRES SO GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOULD WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FINE WE'VE MET BEFORE
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE ER SINCE YOUVE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT P
Line_1981	USE TO PUT A NEIL IN THEN IT'S IT'S LIKE WEIGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHERS BEFORE
Line_1983	YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE MET BEFORE BUT THE I DON'T WANNA MEAN YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH WITH A A NAIL
Line_1985	ACHING THIS ONE UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO YEAH NO
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A A METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IT WORK
Line_1988	METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S A METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IT THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	B BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	AL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO WE HAVE TO U
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL THE LITTLE MIN THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLIDS MORE SOLIDS THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIP RIVER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART FORMED
Line_1997	UM SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN A TRAIL MIXED
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS AND YOUR FOOT
Line_1999	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FED MATERIALS STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATER IS GOING INTO THE BULB BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP ON THE FIL
Line_2001	WATER IS FILTER
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAYED IN THE COFFY FILTER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILT DRAIN
Line_2004	COME THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALTS WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED I IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHEN YOU KICK SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIFE JUST LIED AGAIN
Line_2010	SOIL PRET EX
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIL L
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE AREA
Line_2013	THEY SAID THAT THAT THERE WERE THERE IS THESE THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL
Line_2014	THERE IS HOMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SALT IN ITS
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	MISS GRAPPLE CLAY AND CEL
Line_2017	HUMID GRAVEL CLAY AND SELT
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAIN AND FARM LANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARVAN
Line_2019	DIYLT HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2020	THERE IS A WAT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL AND THAT THIN BECAUSE IT HAS SILT CLAY HUMUS GRAVEL AND THAT'S UFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUM SCRAPFUL CLAINES SILT AND THIS SOIL
Line_2023	ALL THE OTHER KID WITH PUMPED UP IT
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A WOOD OF PLANT LIFE LIKE CACTI AND CACTI AND BUSHES AND MORE CACTI
Line_2025	IT HAS A LOT MORE SAND THEN S
Line_2026	GOOD BYE
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLOW
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT IT'S SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S PLAIN NONE OF THE MIX
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT SOLVE DEVUL DISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS IS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEEN IT'S BULB A PLANT AND THEN IT'S BEAN BIGEAH
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
Line_2035	YES
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	B'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTE
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR LIT
Line_2040	I FORGOT THE WIRE
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WELL WHEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT THE SOLID
Line_2044	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER DISAPPEARS
Line_2045	TIME LOTS OF LOTS OF TIMES
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLUTE OVEN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER LIKE A BIGGER FORM OF AN SOLUTION
Line_2049	THAT THE Y WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE A SOLUTION MIXTUR
Line_2051	OOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER IT WILL
Line_2053	WHAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOWERS MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTIONS
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFEE FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FI FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	EYES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE SOME ME
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO A SKY FOR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPOR
Line_2065	CAN WE PLEASE GO ON N
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMBET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION
Line_2068	SPOONS ARE FLOATING
Line_2069	YE
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIGHER A AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEETER OR BETTER
Line_2072	THEY ARE GOING TO BE A HARD SWEETER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEETER AND THEY TOOK DENSER
Line_2074	THEY ARE DILUTED
Line_2075	BLESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATERS OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD EITHER TAKE OUT IF UM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF W
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY KICKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	BLALLAW OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONE'S A TASTE AND ONES OBSERVED
Line_2083	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON THE SNAIL
Line_2084	ONE'S TEN GRAM TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE WAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED B
Line_2090	SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATE THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION ONE AND SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENSITY HAS IS UHM THE CORK IS LIGHTER THAN THE PENNY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKES SOMETHING FLOW
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS S
Line_2096	BE CAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD SLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THEN WITH OTHER'S THEY MIGHT MIX
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED GOT BACK
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THROUGH EACH OTHERS
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRAM E IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THAN THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINKS OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BY THE BULB YE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THOSE MATERIALS
Line_2107	THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE SHOOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ACID D
Line_2109	BECAUSE IT
Line_2110	MOUNT BEAR
Line_2111	SAME CHART AND OUR SCIENCE NOT BOOKS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS M
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE IT SAID
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SPIN
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	AT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S BIG
Line_2118	SAY IT AGAIN SAD W WHAT A YEAH YEAH HOW MY DUDOMDU
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SAID THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NOW
Line_2122	EVEN DOING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS S
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANTS AND THEY REACT OF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS CITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM LID
Line_2125	A SOLVENT SOLUTES
Line_2126	YOOH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	IT'S TWO L
Line_2128	THEY'RE S FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM IT NOTHING DRUM SAME
Line_2130	ING SODA CALCIUM CHLORINE EACH TO A B
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT IS A PRECIPITATE
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'RE ARE AL MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING JUST ICE GETTING PUT IN IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWEATING
Line_2135	THE WATER IS CHANGING COLOR
Line_2136	IT'S PITY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS BUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIZZED AND I DON'T KNOW W I
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE GRA
Line_2141	I YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE HAS NOT AT ALL
Line_2143	IF A A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FINE OR IF IT TURNED HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	CALCIUM CHLORIDE WATER AND SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY EITHER BLUE UP THE BAG AND FIZZED
Line_2147	THERE IS GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCES WREARED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION ON SNAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE HAS MORE SOLID
Line_2152	I MOW HOW WELL I DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE ALARM
Line_2153	FROM WATER THE YEA L
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	IT'S THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SOM
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A HOPING SO
Line_2157	WELL FIRST VAL SHOOK IT UP SO IT IT'S GOING TO MIX TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO SETALE AND IT'S GOING TO TURN DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THAT'S MY FRIENDS SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNETFYING ON THE BOTTOM AND A SCREEN
Line_2164	THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES ARE ON
Line_2165	NOW FINE
Line_2166	THEY ALL HAVE PROPERTIES OR SHOW IT AND THEY ALL
Line_2167	WE'RE A LON AND METER AT THE BOTTOM UH YOU CAN NOT COMMOR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTAINS OR THE FOMELAN OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	A BYE BYE BY THE AN
Line_2171	WIND WATERS YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILL T THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STONE AND THEN IT STARTED WEATHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF BROKE TO THEN HIT A CUP OF ROCKS AND THEN SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
Line_2174	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVER L UN AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A ROADED UNTO
Line_2176	THE BOULDERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE S
Line_2177	THERE'S TWO GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL HAS BEEN IN THEIR WAY MORE THAN THE BOULDERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING PAMMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN STREET
Line_2179	FLUE ANYBODY THERE IT'S ALL MADE IT ALL
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CAMICAL WEATHERING PHYSICAL WEATHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHANGE ROCKS
Line_2182	LET'S GO COME ON DO YOU T
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER AS DRAIN THAT'S HITTING THE LIMESTONE AND DICINIGRATING
Line_2184	WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT WHEN IS IT
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ACID RAIN IS COMING DOWN A SHIFTING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE L
Line_2186	RAIN AND PRECIP
Line_2187	THE ROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT TOOK TIMES
Line_2188	WITH THE SANDSTONE THE RAIN FREES DOES NOT DOES NOT DO A HUGE DAMAGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIME STONE AFTER AS GRAIN AFTER A YEAR STILL HAD
Line_2190	ITS DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HAS NOT ANYBODY THERE
Line_2192	IT BRIDGED AND A WROTED
Line_2193	ACID RAIN AND ALSO AROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CUP BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE ROCKS
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CRANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS ILLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ISLANDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITION
Line_2199	THE SCREEN TABLE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING MINING CLASS
Line_2200	DEPOSITION AND EROSION
Line_2201	EROSION AND THAT IT'S IN DOT AND A CANINE
Line_2202	THE WATER CAME OUT AND LEFT A TRAIL OF WATER I MEAN MO
Line_2203	IT'S THE DELTA
Line_2204	THE UH ITALINUM
Line_2205	POSITION AT POSITION

Line_2207	IT'S A VALLEY AND UH WHEN WE HAVE TO FLOW
Line_2208	D UNCLE WHALE CAP
Line_2209	EROSION AND RTHMATIELA CIRCUIT CARRIED AWAY
Line_2210	L DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT SAME THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREAM TABLES
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS UM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE IS NOT EVEN CLOSED TO THE BOAT
Line_2213	THAT FLAT IS MANDERING AND THEN STEEP IS JUST GOING STRAIGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEEP SLOPE IS GOING VERY FLAT FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND A CORNERS
Line_2215	FLUIDS WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY DEPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS DONE OUT

Line_2228	MINERALS
Line_2229	THAT THEY'RE NOT ROCKS
Line_2230	MINNARILES
Line_2231	WE USED THERM
Line_2232	MINERALS GO INTO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MENTAL
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCALE TO SEE HOW HARD WHAT A R WE DID THIS IN CLASS
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPPENS WHERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIM MEAN CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WHY DOES IT ALWAYS MAKES A MARK
Line_2237	T DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	I KNOW THE IT IS

Line_2241	DOING MARBLES A
Line_2242	ROCK AND SCRATCH THE TILE YEA
Line_2243	IT HAD P
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH A SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS MIXTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	TH EAT
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GRAPE TASTIC K
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SOLUTE AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WA
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST E
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T HA
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSONS WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOOSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICED THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION AND THE A
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTERS TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS A S
Line_2258	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT BEEN CUT AND THE COFFY FILLED
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	IT THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIX
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET CUT IN THE S
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPOR
Line_2263	I NOTICED THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER PAPER AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND AND THE CO
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT MAKES THE LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER
Line_2266	I I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I THING THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWICE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE O
Line_2270	I I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRE
Line_2272	BUT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
Line_2273	MEAN THIE
Line_2274	THE PENNY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE CORK
Line_2275	THE PENNY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S A LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THAN SOLUTION
Line_2278	SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATE SOLUTIONS FLOWED ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LIGHTER IF WE ADD THE LIGHTER SALT SOLUTION LAST THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON TOP
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION A IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	USE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONES
Line_2286	THAT'S SOR
Line_2287	A A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE- THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	T THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	IS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE TO O
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SOONER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALT'S ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_2295	THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHS
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT AND THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UHM
Line_2299	I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH ITS SOLUTIONS WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I GETS YOU THAT
Line_2303	THEY SERTURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	IT WON'T DO SCIENCE TODAY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TWO REACTANTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THERE IS BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLOR
Line_2308	SOLVENT AND SOLUTE
Line_2309	THEY'RE S LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICED THAT THE MOLECULES ARE WE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFER
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT IT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE VALLOUTHINGS
Line_2314	THERE IS PRIECIPIT THERE IS A PRECIPITATE LEFT OVER
Line_2315	YOU MIXED SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WATER AND HIDROLLICCORIC
Line_2316	THE SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE IS ALL ONE MOLECULE THE WATER HAS TWO TIPS OF MOLEC
Line_2317	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE SCREW
Line_2320	UM THERE ARE BOXES
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCTS OF FIZZING AND THEN IT SETTLED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOWED ON AND IT'S GETTING RUSTY
Line_2323	THE BAG GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2324	THE REST ON THE BIKE AND THEN I
Line_2325	THE GLOW STICK STARTED GLOWING A
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FIZZ A LOT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T WILL
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FISIPTS AND HAS A PRECIPITATE
Line_2329	YOU MADE THREE OH
Line_2330	THAT BOTH THAT DOES TOE
Line_2331	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONSTANT RATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEY'RE MOLECULES LIKE I
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LIGHTERES IN THE BAG
Line_2335	A A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND THE GAS
Line_2336	CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODAS
Line_2337	A SOLID A LIQUID AND A GAS
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE W
Line_2339	N'T KNOW
Line_2340	THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BAG WEIGHS LESS I
Line_2341	BECAUSE ONE OF THE BAGS IS OPEN WHICH LET OUT OF THE GAS
Line_2342	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOIL RAIN
Line_2343	THERE IS HUMANS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2344	CUMES GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
Line_2345	THEY'RE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2346	THEY REEFEROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2347	THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
Line_2348	I
Line_2349	LE
Line_2350	THEY'RE DIFFERENT YOU GO
Line_2351	T SOILS AND ROCKS AND LAND FORMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_2352	THERE IS WATER AND THE CRACKS AND THE WATER F
Line_2353	WELL THE RING HER I THINK IT WAS A
Line_2354	FREASING AND BARSIEON
Line_2355	ABRASION
Line_2356	THE A BREAK THE PART
Line_2357	TI I SAID WILL YOU MARRY ME ANG SHE SAID YES ITS CAN BREAK RACK OF PART IN THINKING
Line_2358	THE TREE IS GROWING DOWN AND LOOKING FOR WATER AND THE ROCK IS IN IT'S WAY SO THE TREE OH BREAKS
Line_2359	HEART SANDS WITH FEAUTY
Line_2360	WHEN THE WATER FREEZE AND EXPAND
Line_2361	THEY WERE LIKE ROLLED DOWN A RIVER AND THEN THEY LIKE BROKE UP AND DIESMOUNTER PIECES
Line_2362	AS- THEY GO DOWN THE PIECES GETS MORE
Line_2363	THE FELT GRAM
Line_2364	FEELING EXTREMELY TERRIBLE TO DAY SO YOU DON'T KNOW NEED TO AT
Line_2365	CHEMICAL WEATHERING AND STUFF LIKE THAT I GUESS Y
Line_2366	THE LIMESTONE IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE OF THE ASIDE
Line_2367	THE SALT IS A MEAOWNE TO THE VINEGAR BUT THE LIMESTONE CAN BE
Line_2368	WELL I
Line_2369	BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL VERY
Line_2370	N I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY
Line_2371	WELL NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENING TO THE STACCHES SO I DON'T KNOW
Line_2372	I HAVE NO IDEA
Line_2373	IS FORMING THE LIME STONE IN IT
Line_2374	ALL MORE YEAH
Line_2375	THE WATER IS WEATHERING AWAY THE LIMESTONE TO MAKE THE CAVE AND SEE THE LINES
Line_2376	PHYSICAL WEATHERING I MEANING MORNING IN N
Line_2377	YOU SHOWED ME THIS LAST TIME AND I EXPLAINED IT ALREADY SOME I GOING TO EXPLAIN IT AGAIN
Line_2378	THEY'RE CON
Line_2379	OH I DIDN'T KNOW UM
Line_2380	AND IF THEY ARE MADE OF BENNUJUST THAT MEANS THAT YOU
Line_2381	AND YOUR IEBROWS LOOK LIKE BANANA NOW THE BANANA ROCK IS
Line_2382	THERE IS GREEN BANANA WEATHER RING
Line_2383	AND A WEATHERING HAVE BEEN THERE AND YOUR EYEBROWS THE LICK AS I SAID IS BEEN
Line_2384	BINANA WEATHERING I
Line_2385	BANANA WEATHERING HAS HAPPENED TO THE BANANA STATUE WITH BANANA IBROWS LOOK LIKE ERBANANA IBROWS AND YOUR BANANA
Line_2386	I'M GOOD I'M VERY GOOD TODAY EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE CAP AND THAT'S NOT GO
Line_2387	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EROSION AND DEPOSITION
Line_2388	THE ONE ON THE SLOPE GO OUT MORE FARTHER THAN THE ONE ON THE SLOPE THE
Line_2389	WATER IT GOES MORE FASTER IF THERE IS MORE SLOPE THAN IF THERE IS NO SLOPE
Line_2390	I NOTICED THAT THERE'S LIKE THE WERE IT'S STEEP THE WATER IS GOING MORE FASTER
Line_2391	THE WATER WENT UP SLOWER
Line_2392	THE FLAT WATER IS FALLING SLOWLY AND ON THE STEEP SALT THE WATER IS FLOWING QUICKLY
Line_2393	THE WATER WILL FLOW FASTER
Line_2394	THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FLINT THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T STUFF
Line_2395	THE EROSION AND DEPOSITION AND THE FLOOD WATER SORE FROM BULB YOU THIER BIGGER IS GOING MORE FARTHER
Line_2396	ONE WITH FLOOD CONDITIONS THE EROSION GOES MORE FAR
Line_2397	FLUID WATER IS MOVING FASTER
Line_2398	THE FLOOD WATER IS FUSTAR UH
Line_2399	THE FLOW OF WATER AND THE FLUE CREEK IS MOVING ALONG FASTER
Line_2400	THE WATER WAYS DARK FLOWING FAST
Line_2401	THERE'S THREE ROCKS IN AN ORDOR BECAUSE PERSON IS WHAT
Line_2402	UM WELL LIKE THE THE TWENTY FOUR SECONT I THINK THEY MIGHTVE BEEN
Line_2403	IT'S L AND SIDE R AND IT'S HI
Line_2404	A SAL SAY SOMETHING I
Line_2405	SLOW CHANGE MANY IT
Line_2406	AND S SALT
Line_2407	YOU THERE'S A S IN HIS I CLOWN F RE GOING
Line_2408	YOU DON'T MAKE HAVE AN FESLY RAL THAT'S WHY WE ONE
Line_2409	HER TALE TI
Line_2410	IT'S TO USE HAPPENING VERY FASTLY IT'S HAPPENING VERY GASTLY
Line_2411	SAY THE VOLCANO IS RUSTING FASTALLY IT'S GOING MEGA FASTLY AND I DON'T EVEN AN OLD COLOR
Line_2412	FAT BUT MARNEY SEE I DON'T LIKE YOU BUT WILL YOU MEAN
Line_2413	GOOD BUT I HAVE TO GO
Line_2414	THE LIMIT POSITION HAPPENING AT THE SAME T
Line_2415	TO TON IN THE
Line_2416	YOU HOW I'M DOING TODAY THAT'S MY BUSINESS MIND YOUR ON
Line_2417	TRUE N AND DO SUPPOSE A SHALLOW
Line_2418	WHAT'S LIKE STRAIN TABLES AND STUFF YOU KNOW
Line_2419	LOVES RENE LIKE THAT
Line_2420	ON THEM BOTH LIKE
Line_2421	AS VALLEY MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_2422	IN A
Line_2423	LINED UP
Line_2424	IT'S BEEN A LUVILE OR HOW THAT MAN AND A
Line_2425	OLD AND DIS POSITION THE ROCKS AND CLAY AND MADE THE AU
Line_2426	DO BLOCKS SHARE THAT
Line_2427	STUFF THAT DO OTHER STUFF AND THEN THE OTHER STUFF HAPPENS AND THEN WELL NO OTHER STUFF HAPPENS AND
Line_2428	ALL THAT'S OFF AND IT DOES STUFF TO MAKE A VALLEY VALLEYS ARE CREATED WELL THAT'S
Line_2429	VALLEYS ARE CREATED BY STUFF STUFF STUFF TABLES ARE CREATED BY STUFF THAT I DON'T KNOW
Line_2430	THERE WAS NEITHER EROSION OR IN DEPOSITION THAT CREATED THE STILT IT WAS YOUR AH WHOLE
Line_2431	DEPOSITION OR A RE
Line_2432	THA- POSITION
Line_2433	IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID A REALLY OR TODAY ABOUT LEM LIKE STUFF THAT LIKE FROCXIN
Line_2434	THE DIMANDDISLT SHINING MORE SHINIER THAN THAN A GIPSON OR
Line_2435	MINERALS ARE MORE LIKE MINERALS THAN ANT MINERAL MABARBAR MA MA
Line_2436	I DON'T KNOW I KNOW I'M BITSY WATCHING FRO
Line_2437	IN TENSION I KNOW I AM I AM PLAYING WITH FROGS
Line_2438	I'D KNOW
Line_2439	IT'S A MO HARNESS
Line_2440	ONE THING AND THEN I THINK DIMENDS TRIED AGAIN
Line_2441	I
Line_2442	THE DIMEN DRAW A WIND ON IT
Line_2443	THE HARD AND IT
Line_2444	I JUST DRAW ON YOUR FACE WITH A SHARP BEAM SORRY I
Line_2445	THE BRIGHTNESS WELL THIS CONNECTS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE MADE SLASH LIGHTS
Line_2446	TO WHAT THIS DO THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO WE MADE LIGHT FLASH FLAT
Line_2447	UM E S ARE EL IT'S ROLE ROCKS AND LANFULE
Line_2448	A BRIGHTNESS
Line_2449	THEY LOOK A LOT MORE DIFFERENT ER
Line_2450	IGHES ON ONE TWO
Line_2451	OU KNOW LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS AND WHERE THE SHADOWS ARE IN THAT MINERAL
Line_2452	LIKE BRIGHTNESS Y
Line_2453	SOMEBODY CRACKS TO BEAT A ROCK WITH THE PICK AX
Line_2454	OUT MAKING ENTION THE METAL AS HAVING FROM PLAYING WITH YOUR
Line_2455	I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION I WAS JUST PLAYING WITH YOUR CUP PROGRAM
Line_2456	IT'S MARKS
Line_2457	A MICK TILE GOT IT'S D ON IT
Line_2458	ITS CAME FROM THE MINERAL
Line_2459	THERE THAT I NOTICE THAT THE GUIDES TO RIGHT HAND IT'S CREEPY JUST M UH
Line_2460	YOU WOULD NEED THE LUSTER THE BRAKES THE STREAK THE HARDNESS
Line_2461	IT DID NOT RULE OUT ANY OPTIONS
Line_2462	THIS MENNICALL EXIBITED A CLEAVE
Line_2463	THAT IS A STRIKE TE
Line_2464	I THINK THAT IT IS JIPPSUM
Line_2465	YEAH Y
Line_2466	THAT IT DID NOT SCRATCH
Line_2467	BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY BOTH SCRATCHED
Line_2468	IT TELLS US THAT THIS MINERAL CAN BE GRAFIDE OR ZIP
Line_2469	MALAKIDES MIKE BUL CALORIE FLORID GOLANA AND GOLD
Line_2470	BECAUSE THEY DON'T PUT THE DESCRIPTIONS
Line_2471	NO YEAH
Line_2472	I FRACTURED
Line_2473	BECAUSE THEY CLEAVE INSTEAD OF FRACTURED
Line_2474	BECAUSE THE ROCKS WE HAD FRACTURED BUT THOSE ONES DID
Line_2475	WE CAN CROSS OUT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR A CUORTS PEN SOIL
Line_2476	I YEAH I GUESS
Line_2477	WE HAVE CFORTS
Line_2478	THEY HAVE NERRADE OUR OPTIONS DOWN THE COURTS
Line_2479	ABSOLUTELY NOT THINGS
Line_2480	EM SOR
Line_2481	DEFINATELY
Line_2482	T'S THAT WE KNOW UH
Line_2483	CARE I'M JUST LIKE WATCHING THE COAL THING IT'S THE IGMIEST ROCKS YOU KNOW IT'S TICK
Line_2484	OR METTARORFIC ROCKS I'M JUST PLAYING WITH THE ARMTRACHAT
Line_2485	YO NO STUFF OR GRAY
Line_2486	ITS RELATES TO SOME MINERAL STUFF
Line_2487	MINERAL PROPERTIES TABLES
Line_2488	MINERAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
Line_2489	THIS IS USEFUL I IDENTIFYING MINERALS LIKE I
Line_2490	TH YOUNG MEAN THAT ROD
Line_2491	UM HARDNESS I JUST SAID THAT WERE YOU ASKING ME AGAIN BUT YEAH I JUST SAID HEAR
Line_2492	BUT SOME OF THE THINGS DON'T WORK
Line_2493	HOW EASILY IT WON'T GET KILLED TO DEATH NO THAT'S THAT'S TESTING THE BRAKE
Line_2494	YEAH MANY
Line_2495	UM UHM THE COLOR
Line_2496	HAT NO
Line_2497	JUST KNOW YOU'RE
Line_2498	I THINK THAT IT'S TO PAY TO P
Line_2499	MU THINGS THE FINGER NAIL DIDN'T SCRAGE IT YAWN
Line_2500	NOT LETTING ME PRESS THE GREEN ARROW
Line_2501	MEANS TO BE CURRENT YOU KNOW COAL A A
Line_2502	A DO AND HOW WE'RE SUPPOSE TO
Line_2503	OH THAT THEY THEY ARE TWO SOFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF A THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHTS WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THE M
Line_2508	THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BALANCING OFF EVERYTHING AND UM AND UH AWAY
Line_2509	A REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BOUNCING OFF VALDIMETERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT ON THE MIDDLE
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEEN THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL LIGHT LIGHT SO
Line_2515	IT'S WEIGHS
Line_2516	EVERY WEARED
Line_2517	A A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS ON THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLICKS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BE BECOMES A BLUE
Line_2520	THE REA HITTING THE VAULT IS WEIGHT AND THE RAYS COMING OFF THE BULB ARE BLUE
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBBSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECTS IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BULB AND THEN THE B
Line_2524	I THINK IT GETS ABSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BALL
Line_2525	THE BULB ITS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLUE LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE A RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT LIGHT THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECTS BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER ITS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNG RE
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE BONES BEHIND IT BURNS OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TO B BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WORK
Line_2537	USE THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE BYE FEET
Line_2539	IT'S SLIPPED BYE IT
Line_2540	EACH ANIMAL HAS TO PLACE IN THE EAGOSISTM AND THEY ARE E
Line_2541	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THE FIELD FOR FOR THE
Line_2542	PLANTS UM IT ME
Line_2543	BEING A PRODUCER MEANS YOU PRODUCE THE ENERGY HERE SO
Line_2544	A PLANT MAKES SODA ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND DIRT
Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE PRODUCER
Line_2546	IT MEANS THAT YOU EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET
Line_2547	ANIMALS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN CALL THE ENERGY TOGETHER
Line_2549	WE GET THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD LUNCH AND ANIMALS THEY D CAN'T
Line_2550	YOU AL THEY EAT PLANTS AND OR
Line_2551	PO LANDS
Line_2552	POURS ONLY EAT
Line_2553	IMALS BEARS LINES LOCKER THE HIGHEST YEAH ANIMALS
Line_2554	A PRIMERICAN
Line_2555	AND OTHEVORE
Line_2556	ERBYVORE
Line_2557	THEY ARE DAMP
Line_2558	A HID
Line_2559	THEY TURN THE LEAVES IN
Line_2560	TH TURNS INTO DARK
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES SAND AND WATER AND A MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SALTY
Line_2567	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID AND THIS MIXTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES TO DISSOLVE IN
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PEANUTS REASONS AND MINI
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHT'S COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWS THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATIONS SHOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME S HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIX A DRAW
Line_2578	BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILL BOUT A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF ITS CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WE KNOW IT'S A SOLUTION SORRY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED WITH THE WATER GRAPE A STICK IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	TH WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENTS A SOLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCALE TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO S
Line_2589	HEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	THI WOULD TAKE SHIGAREER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO I
Line_2593	THE TASTE IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS WELL
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COLD BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE COLD
Line_2597	I AM HAVING A BAD DAY MARNIE
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TYPE OF GAS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK E O TWO WAS SOME CREATED
Line_2601	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TURROENT IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLED THESE REACTIONS
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBBLY M
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING AND W WATER IS MISSING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THINGS MOLLECULES
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE THE S
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APPEAR
Line_2611	THE REACTING MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PROD MOLECULE
Line_2612	RIPE PLEASED
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE A MOLECULE AND THE SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING AT MOLECULES FROM THE HIDROLIC ASIDE
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT FOUL YE
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAVE AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NOT THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FILLED UP AND THEN CALLS DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SERIES PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE IS NO THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FEEL
Line_2623	THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ON TO THE PAINT A RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NOT THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BYE MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FIND MAKING SANDWUAGES RIDING ON UNICINDS AND PLAYING MAR
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2627	THE SALIDS IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
Line_2630	TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED I AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYED ON THE TOP
Line_2634	OR BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENTIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THEM HEAR IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE W
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DOES
Line_2638	OLD MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THINGS THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE W
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	UH PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT UM IS IT A QUAEVULENT SEE
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED ABLE
Line_2648	A THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	CONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNIE
Line_2650	THAT'S TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CETRIC ASIDE DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	GOOD BYE YOU'RE MY BEST S FRIEND
Line_2656	WHAT I YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	M THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICLE SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALL THEM TOOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SURE MARNEY I'M BAD IT'S SINCE
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BUT
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH MAGNET
Line_2661	I I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UHM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	W WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	M ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS A LOT MORE GRIP TASTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNIE THE DARK COLOURED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THE HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONE'S
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE REALLY GROWS AND JUST REALLY DISCUSING AND YEAH THAT'S REALLY OU DO REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TASTE PRETTY BLEND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE LANDS AND A LOT MORE TASTLESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREAT BARNY HOW ARE YOU I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU UM KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WELL YOU YOU CAN UNLESS YOU TASTE IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY A AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE ITS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THESE SOLIDS AND IT SH ARE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND I SEE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETITE
Line_2685	S TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEED AND THE STONE STACKED ON TOP
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEED BECAUSE THE WATER GOES HIGHER THAN THE HOLES AND THE SEE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFEE FIL
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS TO THE FILTERS
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED THAT SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOU ARE PUTTING THE POWDER IN TO THE WATER
Line_2692	TODAY MARNEY WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTE SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE UM SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE A SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW HI YUP
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SE IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2698	I I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2700	THE PENNY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORK
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE AND THE PENNY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOW
Line_2703	UM OKAY A HUNG CRECHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET T
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEAN THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS A ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	HEY ARE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTT
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONES JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED A MORE
Line_2713	BOY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE EACH OR
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I I THINK IT MEANS THAT I'M NOT SURE
Line_2718	T THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTIONS IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION B IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING E SATURATED
Line_2723	IT BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGURED THE SOIL BY WEIGH
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE A SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ASIDE JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHOWER MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH IS SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE A IS SALT I MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPSOM SALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ON E
Line_2737	I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
Line_2740	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2741	REACTANTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCTS
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
Line_2744	A I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTANT
Line_2745	A SOLVENT
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS LOTS OF WEARED STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GASSES
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASSY
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GAS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERY FOLMY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKES BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBBLED UP AND FI S A LA
Line_2754	THERE IS SOME LITTLE WEIGHT STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY'RE MISSING SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WITH HIGH DRAW
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECULES WERE ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A LITTLE A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPLE
Line_2757	ITS UM THEY'RE A MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS S
Line_2758	NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACT THINGS
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCTS TURN PINK
Line_2760	THE FINAL PRODUCTS TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ONE SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFINITELY A REACTION HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FISHING
Line_2763	THE WA THE BUBBLES AND THE CARBON IN WATER ARE CARBON BUB
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOAKING INTO ITS BONE
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST RUSTING
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE BIKE
Line_2768	E CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOWS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO FLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ASCURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE VENTRAL MASS IS
Line_2776	YEAH THIS TELLS US THAT A
Line_2777	I'M I REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNIE
Line_2780	A MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MAKES THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE NUTS THE REASONS AND THE EMMINEMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PEANETS RAISONS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPPENS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISCINEGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH E
Line_2786	THE SOLUTIONS
Line_2787	SOLUTES
Line_2788	A A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	MARNEY I A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYE ILL SEE YOU IN YOUR WORST TERS
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTIONS
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GETTING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE A SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLAS AS SOLVENT OH YEA OH YEAH YEAH I YES I DID I
Line_2797	ESORRIMARNEY HAVE TO GO CAUSE YOU LEADER BYE
Line_2798	I'M DOING GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE'RE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALTS AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TOOTHPICK AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE FAN IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOES S
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBBLES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO SENT THROUGH THE FAN
Line_2804	BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PEBBLES ARE GETTING STUCK IN THE FAN CA MARNEY
Line_2806	THE M MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2807	Y SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBBLES THE SMALLER PEBBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THEN IT TAKE A WIRE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK BUN TO THIS
Line_2811	I I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ON TO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WAS BLACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALIZED THAT THE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREENS
Line_2814	YOU USE A SLEEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBBLES
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBBLES GOT STUCK AND THEY FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT'LL MAKES THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VAPOR SHIN
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNI
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU AND
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT RESOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GREAT TAXSTICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	A A MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE ITS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	TE ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAD MORE FLAVOR
Line_2827	ONES WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	ITS HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	S SWEETER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD CHANCE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRAPYIER
Line_2832	MORE GREAT TASTIC
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN OKAY BYE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RE
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF HIGHER
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SCALE
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE THI IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ICED CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DOESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PICTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFY SALIND BEANS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PURPLE A BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE AND TWO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATE GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLES
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WENT BACK TOGETHER AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T S STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ONE THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE A TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALTS WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALL THEM A SOLLUTE
Line_2863	THE SRO STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLE THE WATER IS FLOWING AND THIS MIXTURE IS WHEAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE RULES PLACE AND THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WEIGH M MORE
Line_2872	ITS MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE IT
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOMES GREATER
Line_2877	A A MIX
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MARNI
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MEAN
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE ME MAN BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWING AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO A UH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	HORRIBLE TODAY THINGS FOUR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAPE DRINK IS A MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS AND THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THEN CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAIT
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PREDICTION MY PRODISCTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	TH FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SORRY MARNIE I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST THE THE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DETERMINE AS BY TASTING THE
Line_2900	WE ARE SEEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBERS THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT MASS
Line_2909	YOU IDENTIFIEN THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUBSTS
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLE
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CHEMICAL THING
Line_2917	IT'S A ADDITION PROBLEM
Line_2918	UM I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2919	THE BAG CLOSED I WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASS WEIGHS MORE
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNEW THAT QUESTION OPENS THE W
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE THEY ARE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL KEPT THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS SCREEN
Line_2927	THE PILED TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S MEAL TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE THOSE TWO ALL MIXTURE
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING REASONS AND EMINIMS OUT OF THE NUTS
Line_2931	THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR TOWN PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BRINGING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATE LE
Line_2934	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATER GETS TRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
Line_2936	THE SAND STAYED ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR DOWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE AM
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SO SOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2943	WE CALL THAT A SOLUTE
Line_2944	T BECAUSE THE GRAPE STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED IN THE OTHERS AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND ON A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THE SAME PROPERTY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIENTS INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE OF SOLUTE
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S UM DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE
Line_2953	THE SOLID THE SOLID SOL
Line_2954	WELL YOU IS WHERE ONE AN GOOD ANT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVE
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTURE I
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSES HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY KEEP THE SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT USES ANY M
Line_2960	YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX A AND THE SODA STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF IT'S PRODICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX THE
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTE
Line_2965	APORATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WEIGH T TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2968	I I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARNED THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEY'RE PROPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILLS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MAG THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ALL PARTICLE SIZE IT'S L THAN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	THE PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SI
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	PHOTICAL SIDE AND MAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PARNICAL SIDES AND MAGNETISM
Line_2979	DIFFERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS BI HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS SWITH WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETS HIGH IN
Line_2981	I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNETS
Line_2982	I NOTICED THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP THE UM THAT FILL WHEN THE OTHER THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	DON'T GO FARNOYBU
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	H HOW DENSE THEY ARE
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PURPLE STU
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IN IT
Line_2991	THE LIGHTALE COLOR SOLUTIONS ARE UH MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLGRA POWDER WILL TASTE SMOWLEY CREA AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAPE
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UHM ONE WITH LESS GREAT POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TASTE IS NOT A THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	M YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	Y YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WAIT
Line_2998	BY MERRINTY
Line_2999	THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU COULDN'T TELL IF IT'S MORE CONSHONIGETED IF IT'S DARKER
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LE
Line_3003	MY PRODICTION WAS RA T THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONES ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	WELL IT MAKES THE THING'S MORE CONTRASTING
Line_3006	BYE THE'RE WEIGHT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS SOLIDS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	NUMBER RINE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST COMMON
Line_3009	IT
Line_3010	THAT'S WE LEARNED ABOUT SACUACION
Line_3011	THE COAL IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY AND THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE COAL
Line_3012	I I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	AND SOLUTION A THEY WOULD THINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	YOU CAN SAY THAT I'S MORE CONTRASTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY
Line_3016	THE MORE ONE WILL SINK TO THE B
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSER WE'LL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYED AT THE B
Line_3019	THE OIDENCITY CAME TH THE OUDECITY BECAME THE C
Line_3020	BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE VITAL ONE
Line_3021	IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GRAY IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN GRAMS THEN IT
Line_3022	SEE YOU THERE'S DAY
Line_3023	UM YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTE
Line_3024	IT'S FLY AND THIS IT'S ALL BLENDED IN
Line_3025	THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3027	THE UH AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	R EACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN
Line_3031	THEY'RE A PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THE OCEAN GLO
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUL SCOOPS OF CICRICITRI ACT ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EASUM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING MAIL LIMIT OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD AND THE WATER
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CITY STUFF
Line_3035	DENCITY YEAH AND CONSOLE AND SATURN
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMIT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATERS
Line_3038	I I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBSCITANT NUMBER WIND
Line_3040	I'M DOING A SOME
Line_3041	CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	RECREINTS
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CACSID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLED THESE REACTIONS TAUGHT AL
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS A MISSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM E THEY'RE SAME PRINT
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW IF HELP ME
Line_3049	I DON'T KNOW I
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_3051	ALL OF THE MOLECLUES AND THE DIFFERENT UM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UHM
Line_3052	CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE EARTH AND NO THING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE COMPERVATION AND MASS
Line_3055	THE I SKIPS OF FLOWING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FASTER
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM BRIGHT
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLE W
Line_3058	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED ITS BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANT TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	T IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTION TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES THE CAMILA REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE T
Line_3062	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM JUST FOLDED IN HALF
Line_3063	THE GLOW STICK IS BEING GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
Line_3064	YES CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIELD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	CONSULVATION
Line_3066	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GREAT TASTE IS ADDED TO THE WASTE
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK IT CAN MICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	MIND ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CHEM IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE UH NOT I SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE A C
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
Line_3073	A A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TALKING A PART
Line_3075	THE THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A B
Line_3076	CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YEAH
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING FIL
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PUT ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	ITS LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED SO
Line_3080	YOU I CALL IT A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARS AND GOES INTO THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NON D
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	I BY UH CAN YOU ONES CENTANCE MADE MY CITY
Line_3085	YOU COULD HIT YOUR FACE WHILE YOU SO WELL NO
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS I
Line_3087	THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED A DISAPPEAR
Line_3088	HE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DIS APPLES AFTER BEING MIXED TO FILL THE WATER
Line_3090	THIS A SOLVENT
Line_3091	E EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	T THE UM
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	IT CAN ENEMY OCLIE
Line_3095	HOLDING A SWITCH THERE BEARINIE
Line_3096	THIS SALTS DISAPPEARED AND NOW IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER
Line_3097	A SOLAMANTS SHIN I THINK CAGE IN IT IT HE IS RIGHT OVER THERE RIGHT
Line_3098	IN A MIX I GUESS IN A SOLUTION NO
Line_3099	THE SACRID ACID DISAPPEARED IN THROUGH THE WATER
Line_3100	LOOK LIKE CAIDES AND RAIN
Line_3101	WHAT IS YOUR NAME
Line_3102	THE SALTS GAVE UNMATIRON
Line_3103	SHE'S REALLY CREEPY
Line_3104	IT GOES INSIDE THE MALCUES OF THE RA
Line_3105	THE WATER READY BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING AN
Line_3106	REAL BE
Line_3107	A DIC OF SOLUTION AND SCIENCE IS COOL AND A PO
Line_3108	THERE ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MOULTR PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY AT
Line_3109	BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RE SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE RUSTY TO THE MIXTURE
Line_3111	THAT GRAVEL IS TOO BIG TO FIT HIM THROUGH IT
Line_3112	BECAUSE THE GRAVEL WON'T GO THROUGH IT BUT THE WATER WILL IT
Line_3113	TH SAFE DEEP THINGS ARE MAGNETIC THE OTHERS ARE NOT
Line_3114	MAGNETISMS AND MAGNETS
Line_3115	SCREEN
Line_3116	BECAUSE THERE'S MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE METAL OF THE SAFETY CLIP S
Line_3117	RAY I GET UH THE SAFETY CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC AND THEY'RE THE ONLY METAL AND THOSE F
Line_3118	ME SILL WAS I
Line_3119	I WAS SO T
Line_3120	Y YEAH
Line_3121	DRY MIXTURES AND HOW TO SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_3122	ADIOS THAT A MIGAS
Line_3123	GRIP STICK STUFF GETTING POURED AND A MIXED WITH WATER
Line_3124	DON'T KNOW
Line_3125	ONE IS HORKER THAN THE OTHER
Line_3126	THERE I WAS TRANSPARENT
Line_3127	CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR CUP
Line_3128	YEA ON MARCH WENT PA WENT AND MY A
Line_3129	THERE WAS LESS POWER THAT I GO OVER IN THE WATER AND THE WA AND THE AND ARE A BALANCED
Line_3130	IT'LL BE SWEETER
Line_3131	THE TASTE OK I NOTICE SOMETHING WRONG THERE IS A THREE SPOONFULS FOR THE SIX SPOONS AND THERE'S A SIX RONFULS ON THE THREE SPOON
Line_3132	THE LEAST TO PUT LESS WATER AND ADD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF WATER AND THE HALF HA
Line_3133	THE WATER F
Line_3134	COIN SIGNAL
Line_3135	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ONE DISSOLVE SOLUTION AND ONE'S A GRAPE SOLUTION
Line_3136	THE DENSITY AND THEN DARKNESS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF EACH
Line_3137	ONE HAS ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTES ONE HAS TWENTY
Line_3138	THE TWENTY GRAMS SOLUTE WEIGH MORE THAN THE TEN GRAMS SOLUTE
Line_3139	YES SURE I REPEAT PLEASE BUT
Line_3140	THE ONES TO THE RIGHT ARE GETTING DENSER
Line_3141	TO DO WIRES NOT FONNY OKAY MONERABLY
Line_3142	THE THIRD ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THEN THE SEC
Line_3143	I THINK THIS SECOND ONE IS THE LEAST CON
Line_3144	THE SECOND IS THE MOST DILUTED OR LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_3145	I HATE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE I
Line_3146	UH SO YEAH LIKE A T
Line_3147	UH I DON'T KNOW WELL WE WERE NEARING
Line_3148	OTTOMAR EDGE
Line_3149	SCIENCE TALKS AND I HATE IT SO LIKE THE TALK ABOUT IT
Line_3150	MIXTURES IN SOLUTIONS
Line_3151	A IT'S WASHER WE SAW IN FINE OF IT LEM J
Line_3152	COMPLETE IT SATURATION IT'S SATURATED SATURATED SATURATION SATURINA
Line_3153	THEIR MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_3154	IT'S SATURATING IT CAN'T HOLD ANY THE WATER IS SATURATED IT CAN HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT BECAUSE IT SALT ROLL
Line_3155	THERE STILL SOME SOLS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR
Line_3156	THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING BUT JUST MASS SHOOGER
Line_3157	IT'S GETTING LIKE IT CAN HOLD THE SHOOKGER ANY LONGER
Line_3158	THE SO SOME ONE CAN AND LOVER IN THE WATER AND HAVE NOTHING HOW THE SAME VACT
Line_3159	YOU'RE MINE'S SO OF AN STICK TO AMOUNTS FIFTY EQUAL SHAVING AND UM WE ALL LEARN THAT IN CANTRCOME
Line_3160	EATING PUSHES AND PENS PIC OF IT I CHOSE IT
Line_3161	I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW A VERY SMALL AND I AM ONLY GOING TO
Line_3162	BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MASS HOLES
Line_3163	WE HAD A WE HAD A ABILITY TO THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT LIKE LIKE A LIKE WHICH ONE WAS WHIT
Line_3164	WELL YOU OH GOD FIND H THE TO MAKE LIKE A
Line_3165	YOU'RE PULLING THE VINEGAR AND THE TROLUTION BAKING SODA INTO WATER AND THEN IT'S PHYSI
Line_3166	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3167	I FORGOT MARNI
Line_3168	THE VINEGAR IS REACTANT THE BAKING SODA IS REACTANT AND THE AH WATER LIKE THE CUP IS A PRODUCT
Line_3169	SHOT HAVE AND OR DATA OURS SHOW
Line_3170	A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3171	REACTANT
Line_3172	REACTS
Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK IT BUT I THINK I I THINK THERE WAS
Line_3174	I SEE AND THE VINEGAR I SEE OXCIGIEN AND UH
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCRIGIN AND HIDRAGEEN ATOMS AND A VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEAN THEY ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT TIPS
Line_3177	THE A UM IS S TO BE DIFFERENT
Line_3178	IT'S FIZZING FOR A LONG LONG UH
Line_3179	CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WASHERS
Line_3180	BAKING AND CACTI CLEAR
Line_3181	IT'S FIZZING A FING HIDING IN AT A RECLA HAND YEA
Line_3182	PARTICIPATE IS THAT ONE IT'S A
Line_3183	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_3184	WELL THE ITEMS ARE BLUE TWO OF THE ITEM ARE BLUE
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE LIKE A THAT'S SO
Line_3186	THERE WAS REACTION THAT LIKE THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY COOL AND LIKE ONE
Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SUBSTANCES POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE MADE IT TURNING PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FADED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NOW IT'S KEE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BAD
Line_3190	IT STARTED FIZZING SO AND ONE IS FIZZING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE BEAR
Line_3192	IT GETS TURN GREEN HOW'S GREAY IT
Line_3193	A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED GRAIN WITH THE DRIP OF CURRENT FLOWS
Line_3194	IT IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT DROP
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER TRYING PURPLE AND IT USED TO BE BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THE RAIN CAUSE IT'S TURNING THE WATER'S TING PAR
Line_3197	IT DIDN'T U NO IT DIDN'T THERE WAS TOO MUCH IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST LIKE STAYED THERE
Line_3198	WE COULD EVA
Line_3199	THE A YOU CLOSED AND THEN WENT O
Line_3200	THERE'S REACTIONS THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE B
Line_3201	D I THINK GUESS HOW SHE LIQUID AN IS SOLID
Line_3202	I SEE BLUE I SEE GRAY AND I SEE SILVER THE GASSES OVER THE LIQUID IS YELLOW
Line_3203	THEY'RE WEIGHING TWO ON TWO DIFFERENT SCAILS UH
Line_3204	AT THE THE ONE WITH THE BACK CLOSED IT WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE BAG UP THAN BECAUSE IT HAS AIR INSIDE IT TRAPPED INSIDE OF IT
Line_3205	THE AIR MOLECULES ARE TRAPPED INSIDE THE CLOSED BAG BUT LEFT OUT AND BALANCED INSIDE THE OPEN BAG
Line_3206	WE'VE BEEN MAKING UM FLOW RED RAGLARS
Line_3207	OUR HUMAN BODIES AND SYSTEM
Line_3208	THIS IS A PART OF THE SYSTEM
Line_3209	WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
Line_3210	EVERY THING SUPPORT THE CAR
Line_3211	THIS HOLE BODY IS A SISTORM
Line_3212	IT'S TELLING YOU WAT WHAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IT IS
Line_3213	IT TELLS THINGS THAT THEY W
Line_3214	THEY WERE TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE SHOMAN BOY
Line_3215	E PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT AS ST
Line_3216	THE AREN'T INCISED BECAUSE IT HAS COUNTRIES AND E THAT'S WHAT MIX
Line_3217	THEY WORK TOGETHER
Line_3218	I THINK IT'S MOTION WITH AND IRON
Line_3219	I REMEMBER THAT UM LIKE POLARTID OTHER PARTS SO
Line_3220	THE BOSFERE IS THE LAND
Line_3221	IT'S MADE OF THE OUT ON THE EAR
Line_3222	I SEE DESERTS THAT I THE LANDS THAT MOST WE HAVE ANIMALS
Line_3223	THEY ALL HAVE SOME THEY ALL HAVE PLANTS
Line_3224	LOOKS LIKE UM A UM A FLUE CHAIN
Line_3225	I THINK IT'S ABOUT THERE'S IT A THINK LIKE ANIMALS GETTING OTHER PLANT
Line_3226	I KNOW AT THIS THAT UM BOATS OF BUGS HAVE LOTS OF B
Line_3227	THEY'RE LIKE THING BUT THAT ANIMALS IS
Line_3228	I'M LEARNING CATTAPILLARS AND COMPOSER THINGS COMPOSER
Line_3229	E MINE MAGNIC POSORS D COMPOSERS AND CIRCUNERIATIVE CORN
Line_3230	COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SEEING THAT YOU CAVE GLASS OF ACID
Line_3231	ARE EXACTLY EACH FER PEACE
Line_3232	BUT DREDGETHER AND HOURS AREA
Line_3233	ER THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
Line_3234	UH THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BECAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCER
Line_3235	BEING A COMPOSERS YEAH EAT THE PRODUCERS SO THAT THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR IN
Line_3236	UH D COMPOSER IT'S THE COM M
Line_3237	THINK YOU GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUMER
Line_3238	THE CON WAS AND TO BUNNY AND THE UM THE BURIED AND THE LITERD
Line_3239	PRIMARY IT RAPIDS ONE OF THE PRIMARY COMES TO
Line_3240	BACTERIA AM FONGI
Line_3241	IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING OR
Line_3242	FINISH I STOPPED TO FINISH IT CARNIVORES MOLARS CONE WHAT
Line_3243	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IJESTIO
Line_3244	THEY THEY ALL GET E
Line_3245	THESE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE COCUMERS AND THESE SIZE A D COMPOSER
Line_3246	THE PRDUTIORS BE COMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
Line_3247	THEY GET THE HUMAN
Line_3248	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY EVEN BECOME IN THE PRODUCER IT'S THE PRODUCE STICK IS TEN IT
Line_3249	I COULD SMART THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER TO GET ITS ENERGY
Line_3250	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONMIANATES THE PRODUCER
Line_3251	SO ONE THAT EAT PLANTS
Line_3252	OH IT'S O ONE THAT EATS PLANT'S AND
Line_3253	SCISTOMS
Line_3254	CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DO COMPOSERS
Line_3255	T IS ABOUT THE FOOD WEB AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_3256	THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUMES THEM
Line_3257	ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THAT GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PROD UM THROUGH
Line_3258	A D CENT COMPOSER IS ALL ABOUT DECOMPOSERS M
Line_3259	THEY'RE IMPORTANT FOOD WILL BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
Line_3260	WE A FIRST SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMER
Line_3261	AND OUR TREVOR IS THE HERBIVORE IT EATS PLAN
Line_3262	A CARONOF WAR IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AN OMNIVORE AND UNIVORODY BERRIES AND MEAT
Line_3263	THEY EAT MEAT INSIDE OF THEIR AR
Line_3264	OMNIVORES EATS MEAT AND PLANTS
Line_3265	THEY WOULD EAT DEAD PLANTS AND A
Line_3266	THIS IS A D COMPOSER OR RED WIGLAR WORM IT DECOMPOSES DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN IT INTO SOIL
Line_3267	A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
Line_3268	D COMPOSERS CREATE SOIL RICH AND SOIL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR SPECIES IT THE RICH AND SOIL
Line_3269	THE WASTE MATERIALS TURN INTO RICH AND SOIL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEEKS
Line_3270	SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY THAT UNHEALTHY RICHEN THINGS AND MAKE THEM HELTHY AGAIN
Line_3271	HOTWAL
Line_3272	IT GOES DON'T
Line_3273	A THUMPS
Line_3274	YOU'RE
Line_3275	THEY ARE UM CLOUDS
Line_3276	IT WON'T ST
Line_3277	H TO
Line_3278	ITS IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_3279	ICE YEA
Line_3280	IT IS STICKING BODY AND IT IS HOW TO
Line_3281	A A HUMAN BODY
Line_3282	THE SPACER I'M DOING FINE
Line_3283	I'M SORRY TO SAY IT AGAIN IT WASN'T HE
Line_3284	HAM MARNEY HOW YOU DON'T A
Line_3285	IT'S A SISSTUM THAT'S LIT TOGETHER
Line_3286	WELL YOU'RE A SISTOM BECAUSE YOU'RE A PART OF A COMPUITER THAT'S RIGHT
Line_3287	I WON'T HAVE A SCIENCE CLASS BUT IT IS A SYSTEM I MEAN LIMENTRARY NOT NOT MIDDLSCOL
Line_3288	MA M HAPPEN AND LEWISVILL LEWISVIAL LOWIS
Line_3289	IT IS STOP BBOXING MY MARNIE CAN HEAR YOU
Line_3290	THAT IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SO SOMETHING
Line_3291	IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT IS A
Line_3292	IT IS SHOWING THE DIGESTIVE SISTOM THE RECRATARY SISTOM AND THE SKELITAL S
Line_3293	THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM
Line_3294	THAT YOU'RE WRONG AND THE HEART IS PART OF THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM
Line_3295	THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE WRONG HEART RESPROTORY
Line_3296	IT IS SPILT UP OF MANY GRAVEPOLES AND IT HAS OTHER PARTS OF IT THAT MAKE THE EARTH LIKE A
Line_3297	IT IS A SISTOME GOD I DON'T HAVE TO RIGHT THIS AM BECAUSE IT IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT PARTS THAT MAKE IT TO ERTH
Line_3298	THEY WORK TOGETHER TO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL MOVED
Line_3299	YEAH SAME THING REPEAT PLEASE CHILL IS A MA LETS GO
Line_3300	GIECTE DOES NOT IN A HUMAN HAVIER
Line_3301	THEY'RE ABOUT A MILLION AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I DON'T THINK WE EVER LEARN ABOUT
Line_3302	BILE FEARS ALL ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IN FACT RIGHT NOW UM ON THE IRE H BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
Line_3303	THE PILES FIT IS MADE OF GRASS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER LIKE A NORMAL THING
Line_3304	THERE IS A DESERT A BORLAINA FORIST AND A W
Line_3305	Y ARE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE THE
Line_3306	THE REST OF THE PILES FAIR IS MADE OUT OF LIKE A LIKE WET LAMPS AND STUFF DONE
Line_3307	OU ARE NOT MY FRIEND ANYMORE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
Line_3308	FRAIL W AS I AM HOW TO COMPUTER
Line_3309	OH HOPES
Line_3310	THE STUDY THING MAGRIGETE
Line_3311	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE EAST IS BRAKING IT'S DURMANSE
Line_3312	THAT THE EASE IS MAKING IT'S DORMANCY I JUST SAID THAT YEAST ME
Line_3313	IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS A
Line_3314	THAT THEY ARE YEAH I ONE HEADS FOR MY EX BOX
Line_3315	S HOW DID YOU DON'T PUT IN THE TRASH AGAIN
Line_3316	THAT THE USE IS A LIKE FRINCIT THIN
Line_3317	ONE WET PLANT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH UHM STUFF
Line_3318	THAT IT GROWS THE PLANTS START OUT THE SEED AND THEN TURN TO THE PLANT
Line_3319	IT MAY BE WATER SUNLIGHT AND STEEL TO
Line_3320	SPACE FOR HIM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE CAUSE HUMANS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUIDS
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUDS
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AIR BUT IT MATTERS ON IF IT STEEL A TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON SIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OCSIGEN FOR US
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF THE SYSTEM
Line_3327	YES BECAUSE IT COULD DRY THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBURGERS I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBURGERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOOD SO NO
Line_3330	IT SHOWS A PLANT WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE FLO AND ASILOM
Line_3332	THOSE ARE SINGLE CELL ORGANISMS OR EACH
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	BUT THEY'RE IN MUSCLE TELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE YOU EXRSIZED
Line_3337	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS OR MUSCLES
Line_3338	THAT THEY ARE PARTS OF HER BRAIN
Line_3339	I SEE SKIN SORT
Line_3340	THAT THEY MAKE UP YOUR SKIN
Line_3341	SO AND RETORT MADE FOR THE SCELTOLE DIGESTIVE NERVOUS MUSCULAR AND REPTORY SISTOM
Line_3342	I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALSO MADE OUT OF D
Line_3343	PLANS IT GET NO TRANS
Line_3344	THEY ALL FORM THE RESPIRATORY SSTOM
Line_3345	IT LONG THE BROWN VARIES THAT I A FLAM IT FROM KILOS DIC THE AND KNOWS A MOUTH
Line_3346	IT KEEPS HER A BODY AND LIFE
Line_3347	IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW THE HUMAN BODY BREATHE YEAH
Line_3348	NING IS ABOUT PARTICPSLOK JE
Line_3349	TO PROVIDE YOUR BODY WITH I AND IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR FING WITH OXIN YOUR BODY WON'T
Line_3350	ABOUT THE HUMAN MASRATORY SISTOM
Line_3351	THAT IS THE NAVIOLA WHICH IS
Line_3352	THIS IS YOU SO THAT A HUMAN DISPLAY OF THE HUMAN RESPERTORY
Line_3353	BELONGS IF YOU THE FROM ROSHREAKY MOUTH NOVES THE AND
Line_3354	THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM ALLOWS A HUMAN BODY TO BREE
Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECOND WALLS IT'S ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3356	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ALIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR SELLS TO GET OCCIGEN AND CARRY THE MATERIAL
Line_3358	TO THE GONE
Line_3359	IS A SMALL I CAN'T CLICK ON IT SO
Line_3360	I CHOSE A
Line_3361	I THINK THE THE ONES PROVIDE AIR TO ALL OF US CELLS IN OUR BODY AND GET RAISE YEAH TWO
Line_3362	BIT HOW M
Line_3363	BECAUSE IT'S A LEAF AND I TOLD YOU WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES RIGHT I CHOOD
Line_3364	I ON MY
Line_3365	THERE LEAVES
Line_3366	FINE
Line_3367	ABOUT THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SISTOM AND WHAT WE USE SO FOR FOR US TO BE
Line_3368	IT IS E AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOLD AND THE SILAM
Line_3369	IT IS CHRONIEAH
Line_3370	THE SMALL STICKS AND THE BRO IS AND THE S WELL THE GAS EXCHANGE IN ONE HOSE HAPPENS IN YOU E
Line_3371	HUH WE'VE BEEN UM
Line_3372	THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE EARTH'S EGO SISTOM
Line_3373	UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE EARTH ON IT CLEAR
Line_3374	BECAUSE THE WEALS AND THE AXLE ARE UM BOTH PART OF THIS SISTOM TO MAKE THE CALL ROLE
Line_3375	TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS ON THE CAR
Line_3377	I SEE UM THE AXLES AND THE WEASELS WHICH HELP THE CAR MO
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBISTMS IN THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE ANDS THE LUNGS AND THE HEART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUB SISTUMS
Line_3381	A MIST HAS THE EARTH IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SISTMS LITTLE SUB SISTM
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUB SISTOMS IN IT TO HELP THE EARTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREES HOUSES AND AN OPTION
Line_3384	THEY'RE PART OF UHM NATURE AND HUMANS
Line_3385	I THINK THE BILE SPELL IS MADE OF OF THE ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND TREES AND NOT HOUSES AROUND
Line_3386	I SEE THAT ALL THE EGALSISTOMS IN THE EARTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BURAL FOR FORCE THE WHIT LAND AND THE DESERT
Line_3387	THINK THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP REPRESENT WHO KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3388	THE LE SPEER IS MADE OF OF SAND AND LIVING CREATURES
Line_3389	IT'S ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND WHAT THEY KILL
Line_3390	THE FOOD WEB MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF EGOASISTOMS THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT THEM
Line_3391	I
Line_3392	THE A
Line_3393	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3394	WE I HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
Line_3395	WE HAVE BEEN BEEN LEARNING THE
Line_3396	NO WE HAVEN'T BEEN LOADING IT
Line_3397	IT GETS HE NOTING FROM THE SUN
Line_3398	BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT GOES IN THE FLAME AS A SUN
Line_3399	GETTING ALL THE FOODS ON THE THING THAT EATS THE PLANTS TO GET THE SUNS ENERGY AND WHAT NOT
Line_3400	ELL IS ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT GROW ON THE GROUND AND BACK PEREA YOU GET IT
Line_3401	THE THE THE GRASS
Line_3402	I DON'T I
Line_3403	SUMMER THE CONSUMERS EAT UH I DON'T KNOW
Line_3404	THE DEER EATS THE RAP AND THE RAPT EATS THE GRASS
Line_3405	BECAUSE BECAUSE IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
Line_3406	A CARNIVORE EATS MEATS
Line_3407	EACH I ARE RIGHTY TOLD YOU ME
Line_3408	CASE CAROMOLEVALY E MY OH CLO
Line_3409	OMTHEBORDS ONLY EAT BERRIES AND ME
Line_3410	EARTH AND BERRY
Line_3411	THEY EAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVEN CAR
Line_3412	D COMPOSER EATS ALL THE STUFF AROUND DAY
Line_3413	D COMPOSERS E RAW THING OR LIGHT
Line_3414	BARNY AND MOST CONCILMLUUM
Line_3415	AND UM THE VALUE TO
Line_3416	A C NO BUL
Line_3417	ERITHMORMS ARE COMNEVORBS AND ITUTTE
Line_3418	THAT THEY LIKE THAT ENVIRONMENTS
Line_3419	THEY WILL DIG HOLES IN IT AND EAT THE FOOD INSIDE THE DR
Line_3420	IT CREATES ON THE SOIL THAT HAS THOSE THINGS IN THE WORLD
Line_3421	BOING WELL HERE HOW ARE YOU
Line_3422	IT LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF WORMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
Line_3423	ALL OF THE PLANTS IN THE GROUND LIKE THE REACT
Line_3424	A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS UM
Line_3425	ALL THE LIVING CELLS AND OTHER PLAN
Line_3426	WHEN I CLICK ON THE LEG I NOTICE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE BUGS INSIDE OF I
Line_3427	MUSCLE CELLS ARE THE MOST PARTS OF THE BODY SO THAT YOU CAN RUN WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
Line_3428	THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THEM
Line_3429	I SEE YOU THE BRAINS NOMIRUMS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE GET A PERSON SMARTER
Line_3430	THE BRAIN CELLS WHAT THE NEMERUN'S COMING OUT OF THEM
Line_3431	THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF A CALLED NEURONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW WHEN NEW NEUMARN COMES OUT
Line_3432	I SEE SOME SORT OF DISIGNE BUT I CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS
Line_3433	IMPORTANT THAT THESE KINDS OF SKIN CELLS IS HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HELTHY HEARTS
Line_3434	THAT THE HELP PULLED THE SKIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
Line_3435	THEY ARE MADE OF THE FLESH AND AT DISC CELLS CONNECT TO
Line_3436	UH YES BECAUSE THE ANIMALS THE MAGNET MANBALS ALL HAVE THE SAME SKIN SEAL
Line_3437	I NOTICE A BUNCH OF LITTLE CELLS IN THE AND IN THE SKIN SELLS
Line_3438	I THINK THIS CAN BE TRYING TO SHOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF SELVES THAT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS HAVE
Line_3439	I SEE SOME SORT OF WEARED LITTLE CELL IN THE UH PLANT CELL THAT'S I MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
Line_3440	THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ME THAT DIFFERENT TYPES A CELL AS EACH ANIMAL HAD
Line_3441	WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT HUMANS AND CELLS IS UM ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
Line_3442	THAT THERE IS A BLOWING SCREEN AND FROM
Line_3443	ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGESTIVE STEM ON THE HUMAN
Line_3444	DIGESTIVE SISTOMS HELP YOUR FOOD BREAK DOWN AND GO INTO THE BLOOD
Line_3445	IT BREAKS DOWN SLOWLY
Line_3446	SAFIGURS LEADS THE FOODS TO INTER THE STUMMICK
Line_3447	THE LIQUID ACID
Line_3448	THEY ARE THE BIGGEST PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3449	THE LONG IN STANCE IS FOR THE WEST REMOVAL AND THE SMALL INTESTANCE IS FOR THE FOOT TO GO DOWN
Line_3450	THOUGH JUST SLOW SO GO UNDER A BLUB STREEM
Line_3451	ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL OF THE PARTS OF SIT
Line_3452	WE WON'T ON THE EACH STAY SO
Line_3453	OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL CELLS THEY'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT T
Line_3454	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING CELLS INSIDE OF IT T
Line_3455	H THE HUMAN BODY CELLS
Line_3456	IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR SHELLS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3457	PINE PALMEE AND ANOTHER ONE
Line_3458	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
Line_3459	UH THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND ON THE LIKE THE PALMATE HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HAND S LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
Line_3460	THEIR PATTERN ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIZE OF THE LEAF
Line_3461	HOW SOME ARE DIFFERENT A OTHERS
Line_3462	APPALMAY PALMAY AND PARALLEL
Line_3463	THAT IS A PALMATE
Line_3464	TO HOLD THE LEAF TOGETHER
Line_3465	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3466	THE RESPIRATORY SISTOM-
Line_3467	I I KNOW NOW
Line_3468	I THINK THE VASILO SISTOM LIGHTS S ALL OF THE THINGS S
Line_3469	ONE TWO GOES UP THEN OTHER TWO GOES DOWN
Line_3470	THE LEAVES
Line_3471	THAT DOES THAT MEAN
Line_3472	BYE BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_3473	GOOD I
Line_3474	IT'S ALL THE PLANTS OR BING OUR SUN
Line_3475	BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING US THE CENTIME SOLAR FLAG
Line_3476	SO DRAW LIKE A
Line_3477	DR STEEL GURDENS AND ALSO THE INNER PLANETS
Line_3478	THE INNER PLANET ARE SUPER SMELL
Line_3479	THE EARTH ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVITY WE HAVE TO SHOT IN A
Line_3480	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CSISTOMS
Line_3481	EARTH LUGGAGE COMPUTERS CARS THE HUMAN BODY AND THE UNIVERSE
Line_3482	IT HELP IT SAYS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN A I DON'T
Line_3483	A SISTOM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SISTOM
Line_3484	THOSE ARE THE WHEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE
Line_3485	IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THE INVOLVING THE SYSTEM
Line_3486	OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY LIGHT
Line_3487	IT IS ON EARTH IT IS THE EARTH AND THAT IS A T
Line_3488	THE INTERACTING PARTS AND IT
Line_3489	HI I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKES OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN MOTION HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES S
Line_3492	UM THERE ARE EGOCISTIOMS AND UM I FORGET THE REST
Line_3493	IT THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3494	I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFRICA IT BROUGHT UP A DESERT
Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND IS
Line_3496	THEY CAN A I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	ITS MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
Line_3498	WHAT T UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THEM
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY ARE TO A D COMPOSER
Line_3500	ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SISTUMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS OR BATERIA
Line_3501	SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE M
Line_3502	IRE CONSUMERS AND D COMPOSERS
Line_3503	PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATH AND EAT
Line_3504	A PLANT BREATHS IN SEE TOO WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND THEY BREATHE OUR AIR WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATH IN
Line_3505	THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SODA
Line_3506	CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMAER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
Line_3507	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASK
Line_3508	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3509	IT IS A FOOD CHAIN OF MANY DIFFERENT TIN
Line_3510	SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEATS SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS SOME OF THEM EAT BOTH
Line_3511	THE CAR BEFORE IT ONLY EATS PLANTS
Line_3512	THINK THAT EN ANAMORE MEANS THAT YOU EAT BOTH PLANTS AND THE ANIMALS
Line_3513	I THINK A DECOMPOSER IS
Line_3514	DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3515	IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER UM THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE EARTH THAT HELPS IT GROW
Line_3516	I THINK HE IS COMPOSER
Line_3517	CARNIVORES
Line_3518	IT IS A HU ABOVE
Line_3519	IT'S A D COMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE EARTH
Line_3520	THEY ARE EATING THEY THE DEAD LEAVES AND THE NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOSE
Line_3521	FORMS UM D COMPOSE IT AND MAKES IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	I HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SIX GUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF A BIG ITEM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD DOESN'T S
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3527	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3528	IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE
Line_3529	THEY MAKES THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
Line_3530	THE BAG THE BIRD THE HACK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3531	A D COMPOSER EACH SED PLANTS AND AN
Line_3532	THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
Line_3533	HERE WE GO THE MUSHROOMS
Line_3534	YEAH A A CONSUMER
Line_3535	A A COMPOSER
Line_3536	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT A
Line_3537	BEING IN RBEVOR MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
Line_3538	TO BE A CARNIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NOT PLAN
Line_3539	IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
Line_3540	THAT THEY ARE NEITHER A HUTRBOVOR OR A COMONVOR OR A ON THE B
Line_3541	THAT CURIETE IS A D COMPOSER
Line_3542	I THINK THAT A MOOSE IS A ER BUMBLE
Line_3543	I THINK THAT THIS FOX IS A CARNIV
Line_3544	THEY ARE WARNS THEY ARE COMPOSERS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDENS AND PLANTS
Line_3545	A RED WORM IS A COMPOSER
Line_3546	THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDENS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT STEMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT A I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY DO YOU TELL ME
Line_3550	EST IS A FUNGUS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN ITS DORAMENT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANTS GROW
Line_3554	SOME LIGHT WATER AND SWAILE
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TOO HEAVY THE PLANT WILL DIE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SUM AND THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO SURVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NEW TRANS TO SCERVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SODA BY FOO CINPHACIS
Line_3561	TO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
Line_3562	PLANTS NEED SUN TO SURVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WELL
Line_3563	THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO D
Line_3564	THE PLANTS GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEED EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SURVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIE AND WILT T
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUNS AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD LIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT STUMS AND THE DIGESTIVE STU
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SITTING THE B IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND THE THE GASES ARE FLYING
Line_3571	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND IT IS BRINGING THE POLLEN BACK TO THE HOMICO
Line_3572	IT SHOWS THAT ONE BE ONES OTHER BEAMS TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE OF SOMETHING
Line_3573	IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE I WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
Line_3574	ONCE THE DOORBELL RANG THE DOG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT IT'S MASS IT'S MASTERS
Line_3575	IT STOPS THE MSKETO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
Line_3576	THE DOT THE DOORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULUS IS THAT THE DOG BARK
Line_3577	THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS A THE BRAIN AND
Line_3579	THE NERVES SISTOM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHIN
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMALS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGESTIVE SISTIM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN ADAPTATION
Line_3583	THE SCUNP IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DEFEND ITSELF FROM PREDATORS
Line_3585	IT'S ADD AT ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHELW BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SURVIVE FROM PREDATOR
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADAPTATIONS IS IT'S POWDERON ON IT'S BACK AND ON IT'S BODY SO THAT IT CAN BE CAMFLASHED IN WITH IT'S A T
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEBBED FEET
Line_3589	NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS BUT IT CAN FLIE
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE POKER NEAR AWAY
Line_3592	THE SNAKE HAS AN ADAPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTLE IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTLE SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMULI
Line_3594	IT IS ENVOLVING A SCUNNCH WHICH IS FOOD FOR THE WOLF
Line_3595	AN ADAPTATION THAT THE SKUNK HAS IS IT SMELL THAT MAKES THE SKUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SMELL TO
Line_3596	UHM UM WHAT DOES CLASSIFY MEAN
Line_3597	IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BIRDS ARE FLYING AND THE ONE AND THE FRONT IS THE LETTER
Line_3598	IT'S BEHAVIOR IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CATCHING THE DISCS
Line_3599	NO I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FRISBEE WHEN THEY
Line_3600	NO I I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
Line_3601	IT IS A NO UNARNED BEHAVIOR
Line_3602	THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOUR
Line_3603	THIS IS THE NOT LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY WHEN THEY'RE BORN
Line_3604	THE CAT FALL OUT OF THE TREE
Line_3605	THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT THEN UHM THIS THEN EACH OTHER
Line_3606	THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY CELLS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3607	THAT IT IS PINKY
Line_3608	THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUE E
Line_3609	THE ALL THE BIG BULLS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3610	MANY BLUEEE SCULLS THAT LOOK LIKE SKIN
Line_3611	SKIN CELLS HELP YOUR BODY AREA HELP CUTS AND THINGS
Line_3612	THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN YEST DOES
Line_3613	THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS IN IT'S BODY AND THEN IT SWINGS
Line_3614	IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3615	WE BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3616	IT IS SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTINTS AND THE LUNG
Line_3617	THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET IT BACK OUT OF OUR BODY Y
Line_3618	IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
Line_3619	THAT IS WHERE YOU WHERE THE FOOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTINE
Line_3620	THEY TRAVEL THE FOOD TO HELPS IT GET OUT
Line_3621	IT IN THE HUMAN BODY
Line_3622	THIS IS TELLING YOU PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THE
Line_3623	THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING IN TO YOUR BODY AND GOING INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN COMING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
Line_3624	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATHE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3625	IT COMES IN TO THE BODY THROUGH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH
Line_3626	THERE ARE TWO BS THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRINK YEAST AND GO DEEPER INTO THE LUNG
Line_3627	N BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS LONG
Line_3628	AIR GETS TAKE IT IN TO THE BODY YOU BY WHEN YOU INHALE IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
Line_3629	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3630	GOOD HOW GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3631	IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Line_3632	THE DOG CIRCULATORY SISTOM AND THE HUMAN CIRCULATORY SISTOM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAM
Line_3633	THAT IS OUR HEART AND SOME OF OUR BLOOD IS GOING IN TO OUR HEART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
Line_3634	I SEE OH TWO EACH TWO WOUL COMING GOING OUT OF THE
Line_3635	THE BLUE PT IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART OF THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH THE CAPILAR
Line_3636	THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH CAVE
Line_3637	I THINK THAT THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATH
Line_3638	BLOOD GOES THROUGH BLOOD VESSILES AND GOES INTO THE HEART AND GOES OUT OF THE HEART
Line_3639	I THINK THAT BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART SOME BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART AND SOME BLOOD COMES OUT OF THEM
Line_3640	AY IS THE BLUD VESSELS
Line_3641	SE IS THE BLOOD AND IT IS THE BLOOD STREAM WHERE THE BLOOD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
Line_3642	THE RESPITORY SISTOM IS HOW YOU BREATHE
Line_3643	THAT IS ABOUT THE AIR GOING ONTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
Line_3644	IT COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THEN KNOWS
Line_3645	IT IS ALL ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3646	LONG S AND YES IT IS IN THE RESPRATORY SO
Line_3647	THE DIAFAM THE DIAFRAM
Line_3648	WELL ACTUALLY I'VE ALREADY A PASSED IT
Line_3649	THEY ALL HAVE INDILRECTING PARTS
Line_3650	THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
Line_3651	IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT AND IT MOVE WITH ALL PARTS
Line_3652	IT'S YOUR BODY YOUR BODY IS A VERY BIG SYSTEM WITH SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
Line_3653	THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR MORE
Line_3654	THE INDIRWECTING PARTS
Line_3655	WE HAVE IN DIRECTING PARTS AND SMALLER SISTUMS INSTEAD OF OUR BODY
Line_3656	A SMALLER SISTOMSUBE SISTOM
Line_3657	HAS ISLANDS OTIONS AND LIVING THINGS AS BY A SFEREICATMISFERE AND OTHER SMALLER SUBISTOMS
Line_3658	THEY IT HAS A BYE A SPEER A
Line_3659	LA WAIT WOUND SIDE I THINK
Line_3660	LIVING THINGS
Line_3661	T HAS CREATURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
Line_3662	THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
Line_3663	GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
Line_3664	FODWILBS
Line_3665	THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN D COMPOUTS D COMPOSE THE PAPE THE CONSUMERS
Line_3666	BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD
Line_3667	THE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE
Line_3668	BY EATING EACH OTHER OR ER THE PRODUCERS
Line_3669	THE HAIR THE SNAKE THE HOUCK THE BIRD THE BEALE AND THE SALAMANDER
Line_3670	WHEN THE CONSUMAR DIVE THE D COMPOSER BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF NUTRIENTS
Line_3671	THE DEAD BODY AND TREES AND STUFF OF DEAD ANIMALS AND TRUE PLANETS
Line_3672	THE BACTERIA AND THE MUSHROOMS ARE FILLING G
Line_3673	A BEARIY OR A PEBBLE PLAN
Line_3674	AMONG THI AREA MATHREUMS
Line_3675	MUSCROUM OR FUNGI E
Line_3676	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_3677	CONSUMERS OR HUMAN
Line_3678	CUMNEAVORS AND UMNEAVORIES IN HERBIVORES
Line_3679	CONAWARES EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAT
Line_3680	THEY EAT PLANTS IT ONLY PLANT'S
Line_3681	PRIARES EACH ONLY PLANS
Line_3682	Y HERB WAR
Line_3683	TO ONLY EAT PLANTS TO EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT WEIGH WE
Line_3684	A UM NERVOR
Line_3685	AND UH MELT THE ARE
Line_3686	TO EAT ONLY DEAD THINGS
Line_3687	LE LIKE ONLY D D COMPOSED TO STUFF OR DED STUFF
Line_3688	A COME M CARONEVORE
Line_3689	IT'S A D COMPOSER THEIR WORMS THEY EAT ONLY DID STUFF
Line_3690	A A COMPOSER
Line_3691	THEY PRODUCE HEALTHY STUFF OR PLINENTS OR IS AT EARTH WORKS I
Line_3692	MORE FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WOODS BUT WE ALSO STUDYED MARS COINOVORS AND HERBIVORES
Line_3693	A ME ANIMAL CRACKERS WHICH HAVE SHIGER AND FLOWER AND WASHER
Line_3694	I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM A AND GETTING IT'S NEW TRANS
Line_3695	EVERY VERY MUCH SO
Line_3696	WELL THE UM FLIN ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
Line_3697	THE PUT ALSO NEEDS SUN
Line_3698	OH LENS DON'T NEED HENBIGERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD BUT THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD BY USING SHOOGER SUNLIGHT AND WATER PAPER
Line_3699	AL FROM F DIVE IS NEED REALLY MUREMUD CAUSE IT PRODUCES IT'S OWN DEN
Line_3700	T LOOKS LIKE CELLS
Line_3701	WE I A USED EXPERIMENT
Line_3702	IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
Line_3703	E LOOKS LIKE A FACTORY
Line_3704	I DO NOT KNOW I FORGOT
Line_3705	UM THEY RE VE THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS THE BUSSL AND THE T DOTS IN BETWEEN
Line_3706	THEY LOOK LIKE NERVES
Line_3707	UM NORMAL SELLS BLOOD SELLS
Line_3708	TIP OUT OF BY SKIN
Line_3709	THEY'RE MADE OF CELLS EVERY THINGS MADE IT CELLS EVERY LIVING THINGS MADE IT
Line_3710	YE HAVE A LOT MORE CELLS THAN YE
Line_3711	HUMAN BECAUSE YOU WE'RE NOT JUST ONE CELL ORGAN ORGANISM LIKE E
Line_3712	A BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT THE SE
Line_3713	I FORGOT M MISTAKE ABOUT THE LIGHT YEAH I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_3714	THE DIGESTIVE SISSTOM
Line_3715	WE BOTH HAVE DIGESTIVE ISTOMS
Line_3716	OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Line_3717	BRAKING DOWN FOOD AND GIVING YOUR BODIES ENERGY
Line_3718	THE MOUTH BREAKS DOWN THE FIELD
Line_3719	THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STUMMICK IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE ST MIX
Line_3720	BRINGS FOOD DOWN TO THE STU MICK USING MUSCLES
Line_3721	IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
Line_3722	TO BREAK DOWN FOOD AND YEAH
Line_3723	THE INTESTINES EXZEARB ALL THE NEW TRANS AND WATER FOR IT TO UH USE FOR A BODY
Line_3724	IT GOES OUT WAYS SWITCH IS DISCUSS STEEN
Line_3725	WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND PLANES
Line_3726	IT'S PALM
Line_3727	IT'S A PO OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE PEE I THINK
Line_3728	GETTING FOOD FROM PLACE A PLACE MAKING FOOD
Line_3729	ENDS THE PLANT AND STUFF
Line_3730	WELL THAT'S TO BAG AROUND IT LEAVES THAT SHOES WATER VAPER COMING OFF FROM THE LEAF WHICH IS VERY USEFULL
Line_3731	A UH I FORGOT
Line_3732	AX A IN WHICH HELPS OUR BODY WELL THAT HELP MAKES OUR BODY LEAVE
Line_3733	THEY BOTH HAVE PARTS IN VEINS
Line_3734	THE CIRCULATORY SSTOM
Line_3735	THEN THE HEART LET ONE SIDE OF THE HEART PUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BODY AND THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMPS TO THE BACK
Line_3736	OCSIGIEN UM FOOD WILL NEUTRANTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WAY
Line_3737	BLUE OR SETTELES
Line_3738	THE SAME THING
Line_3739	UM FURNACH- LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
Line_3740	BLOOD VESSILS THE HEART AND BLOOD
Line_3741	BLUED'S GOING IN AND OUT
Line_3742	THERE WON'T PRONG THE THE VAINS DELIVERY SISTOM THE HEARTS DELIVERY SISTOM THEN THE VAINS IN THE RODS
Line_3743	IT LED TO THE PART TAKES IT AWAY
Line_3744	PRODUCE THE HIGH WAIST FOR BLUD AND THEY'RE CALLED VAINS AND ARTERY
Line_3745	UM THE PUMPS
Line_3746	SEE UM USE IT HOLDS THE BLUOD
Line_3747	IT'S THE IT'S SO LONG THAT PRIVELGE MEANS THAT IT'S A RESPITORY SISTOM AND YEAH
Line_3748	IN THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Line_3749	TERRESPITORE IS A CINTIMA'S RESPONSIBLE REATING OCGION ENGER BODY AND CARBON CID OUT
Line_3750	THEY ARE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS AND EVERYTHING WORKING
Line_3751	GETTING OCCIGIN DEER CELLS AND GETTING CARBENDAY OCCIDE OUT
Line_3752	IT TAKES IN AND FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE
Line_3753	THERE WE TWO C CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF TO THE TRACKIEAH DEEP AND GO DEEP INTO THE S AND THEY PRONENCIAL THE AIR SACS
Line_3754	CELLS ARE DROPPING CARBON X AND PICKING UP OCCIGON
Line_3755	UM ELSE
Line_3756	EACH THE AIR SIX OR BOLIDE
Line_3757	ZE THE UM
Line_3758	THE CIRCULATORY IS
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE WHOLE SISTM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BIOSFEER THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BIOSFEER MAKING IT ON ENTIRE SISTOM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ISTOMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SORRY I'M ON THE WRONG UM IS WEB SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELPS ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE USED OR USED PARTICLES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT UM NATURALLY SORE
Line_3768	MAY BE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOOD AND WATER TO SURVIVE
Line_3770	SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FIRNALISE
Line_3771	DEFINITELY DEPTH AND LAY DEFINITELY DATA THOUGHT OUT ARILLA WE
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANS ALSO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO STERVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE MOTO CINPHICIST TO GET THE IT FROM I MEAN TO START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS EAST OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SO
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY CELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG CELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE YEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE SO THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIANS OF S
Line_3779	IT'S E BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DI JUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FINE
Line_3782	UH CELLS AND ORGANISMS AND SISTUMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH UM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS AND ONE SISTM
Line_3784	PINK MUSCLES IN IT IN THE LEG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSCLES
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSCLE CELL
Line_3786	THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS AND THEY BRAIN ORGANIZED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AND THE EST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE CELL
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLIES NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY E AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF CELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SISTOMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISMS AND SYSTEMS IN SIDE OF OUR BODIES
Line_3791	GETTING FOOD THROUGH IT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONT IN THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
Line_3792	IT HELPS YOU GET FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMICK SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THE FOOD
Line_3793	TO DIGEST THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FOOD ENERGY
Line_3794	I'M VERY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SCARED ME HALF TO DANCE OH HOW ARE YOU
Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW OR WE WEE NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DIDN'T BREATHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIE
Line_3797	I THINK E THE DIEGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE A OLAVIOLY AND YEAH THE OLVIOLEY EACH
Line_3799	GOOD TO MISS LIKED HOW ARE YOU
Line_3800	I THINK WING THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN'S BODY
Line_3801	BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS CO TWO AND O TWO
Line_3802	A HAND BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3803	ITS
Line_3804	I'M A NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE TALK TO EARLIER
Line_3806	ISTOMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I I THINK THAT IS A HEART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VAIN'S CONNECTING TO THE HEART
Line_3809	EACH TWO TO AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD CELLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH ARE THE VAINES AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
Line_3811	THAT'S THE BLUE PART IS CELL OUR SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAVOLARY
Line_3812	IT S LETTING AND BLOOD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLOOD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLUD AROUND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BODY
Line_3814	BLOOD VESILES THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOOD AROUND
Line_3815	THE PUMP SPLD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	L IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING A THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY ISTOM

Line_3819	UM THE LUNGS DEFINANTLY THE LUNGS
Line_3820	A THE LONG LOSER
Line_3821	THROUGH AND BY THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TRESCHIEA
Line_3823	THE RATTLE SNAKES RATTL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORRIED WHEN HE SAW THE SPILL OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT I USED THE QUITE FAT MAN
Line_3826	UH I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SILSTOMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTICES SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WE FEET
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN TRIP OPEN HIS PREY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FOG AT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF GAS ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOES BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIOR
Line_3833	UM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WEATHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW A FISH BEFORE IT
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURTS SO THEY JUST GO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THERE'S SPECIAL REFLEXES
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHETHER
Line_3838	BE CAUSE THEY ARE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SISSTOM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTOM THI IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT IT HAS SYSTEMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AN IN ACTION OF MOVING POUCH TOGETHER MAKING A AL
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POD IT MOVEMENT WALL TOGETHER
Line_3843	IS BECAUSE IT HAS INTERACTING POWERS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM
Line_3844	THE HOST AND THE IS
Line_3845	THERE IS MOVING POW IT'S MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES THAT
Line_3846	YEAH HAVE TO MOVE HUND TO WE TOGETHER
Line_3847	THIS I SEE THAT'S A MOUNTAIN LOOKING THING E AND IT HAS COURSE STUMPS
Line_3848	SO
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLANTS IN THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND A MINERALS
Line_3850	EGO SISTOM AND LIKE IS THE BROWN
Line_3851	THE HEEP ARE LOOKING FOR AMINALS AND THE AMINALRS ARE EAT
Line_3852	AS THE EMIRALS PASSES THROUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ALL PRODUCING A ESTIM- OF THE OR
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STEMS
Line_3855	IS A SISTOM WITH INTERACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SISTOM
Line_3856	IF IS A BENTVINT OR ACTING PARTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE AN ARM DEE BOUT MOVING THE OTHERS
Line_3858	IS IT HAS BUNCH OF SUBCISTOMS TEN OR A MAKE ONES
Line_3859	I THINK THAT THESE ARE CYPTITIOUMS
Line_3860	TICITIUMS BECAUSE IT'S A THING AND WE'RE ACTING ABOUT MOVING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT WALK DIC A TO PUT HORSES
Line_3862	GOOD I
Line_3863	BOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF IT'S M
Line_3866	IT'S BODY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSISTOM
Line_3868	A HEART ACID N AND E
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGER PART OF US OF SOME SUBSYSTEM
Line_3870	THEY'RE A
Line_3871	I DO STEER IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN E GO SISTM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S LAND AND MOTION
Line_3874	THE ARROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE A LIKE OR WHAT AND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER IT CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD ME THAT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NOW I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I I THINK THAT WARM PLACE IS WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE CIRFIC
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE CIRFICE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO SHRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR A TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRFICHE AREA AFFECTS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE CIRFITCE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED ME QUITE YET I
Line_3886	YES I THINK PETRALS EVAPORATE QUITE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SOIL AND THE ROCKS OR GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER ON THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GAS STAGE
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP RICE WATER DROP LIT IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THEN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING HAIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITTING AND THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER TEL TO HELP US LIFT A PAPER CLIPS
Line_3894	WARNING YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	THAT'S ALL CAME MARNIE
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEAL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIER OR LATER THIS ER
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENTS
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY IT WERE AND IT WAS PRETTY CALL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HER MASSES HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGHS MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HEAVIER TH AND PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS S
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO YOU TH
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SI AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_3907	THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH IN THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SAL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS ARE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY COULD BE
Line_3909	WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT
Line_3911	WILL HELPS YOU KNOW THE EXACT THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISK IS S
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED AT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORTED A GUESS
Line_3914	Y YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WON'T BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST ONE HAS TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE FOUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE IT WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND AND IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROPE HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE ELECTRIC ISTOM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHEAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
Line_3922	UH YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHING'S BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND CUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR YOU WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S AS LENGTHWISE IT COULDN'T GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT UH I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE SCALE YEAH THE SKIN YEAH
Line_3927	NO A DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE COUNT HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM M THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WAIST THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BING THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	I NOBBLE METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	IT A NO NOT YET YEAH
Line_3932	YES THIS BUG OH SORRY
Line_3933	THAT WOULD BE FIVE IN
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLASTIC K WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	O SORRY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM DUM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_3939	WHEN A GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I I I WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT I I SHOULD GET IT OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWER S
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY PLACE AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME SIZE PAPERCLIP
Line_3943	A A
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DEATHS WITH STRAWS
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT TALL
Line_3946	UM TRUBSICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRETTY USEFUL BUT THEY CAN'T BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING CA
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NO NOT YET NOT NOT YET
Line_3950	UH NOT REALLY NOT
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T LEAN YET NO
Line_3952	H WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDENT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HAD ONE
Line_3953	UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER S YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO A REALLY
Line_3955	UH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER JUST USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH Y
Line_3958	HAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAN TAKE THESE OFF OKAY
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR EM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH JUST THIRTY IT PIECES HEN I WALKED E YEAH
Line_3962	YEAH IT WATER BO ENOUGH I HAVE NO LITTLE I DEH NO
Line_3963	Y YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO I DON'T REALLY KNOW I
Line_3965	TWENTY EIGHT LITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE KNOW REALLY JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO AT THE YEAH
Line_3967	TON YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBE BECAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE A
Line_3969	I HAVE NO CLUE YEAH SAYING THAT'S CLOSE IS ER D YEAH
Line_3970	BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER MASS
Line_3971	IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY Y OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
Line_3972	UM YEAH S WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY CAUGHT LETTERS YEAH
Line_3973	UM I S LEARN THAT
Line_3974	YEAH REPEATING THINGS IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONE AND I HEARD THAT ON SHOW AS ALWAYS M OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERY ONE GOES ON YEAH
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WORD FOR GUESSES
Line_3977	GRAM IS ABOUT AS ONE IS PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO ILLOGRAMS AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A A GRAM IS THE S OUT AS ONE CLOSED A PAPER TIP
Line_3980	THES TO WEIGH AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	UM YEAH HAH A THOUSANDS
Line_3982	A MILL GRAM AND THERE'S A THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGHS A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	AM EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BE ONE LINE
Line_3984	THE SNAKE THAT SHINY THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM USE THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRATE IT WOULDN'T BE A IT SLANTED
Line_3986	O KATE BUT I WANT TO SEE VENTERACT TO CHIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGES WEIGHT MORE
Line_3988	WE A WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM VE HACK LI CEREY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED PEN EQUALS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE THAT OR THE BEAN EQUALS A GRAM
Line_3992	YES THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
Line_3994	A HUNDRED GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM IT'S SEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP IN ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD D TWO MORE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT'S THE INERRACTIVE CLIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSES
Line_4000	AND WE DID WEIGHT WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	HE LIKE THAT THING IS GOING H THING GOES UP
Line_4002	M READING RITING AND MASS MAINLY
Line_4003	KEY HU HU UH SLICHES RED
Line_4004	OH YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DISK WITH THE STRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING THAT LINE A BIT
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE'S DISC WITH THREE BY TWO BUT MINE WAS TWEN NINE TENTH TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DISCS SEEMED SHORTED AND ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSE TO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NINE TENTH IS A I MEAN TWO AND NINE TENTH IS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE P WENT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	MEA OKAY
Line_4011	HERE NO WELL YEAH WE DID WE DON'T GO HOLD SO FISH MAKES A
Line_4012	UM A METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOURS NAMES THEY ARE
Line_4013	NO IT N IT ISN'T COLORED AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I'M I HAVE NO IDEA YOU MIGHT COLOR IT SOMETIME
Line_4015	THOSE THINGS MARK CENTIMETERS SALTS OKAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDREDTH OF A METER IT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER I'M ALL THE WAY LONG LIKE IT
Line_4017	NO WE'D JUST WE'VE JUST STARTED CUTTING IT OUT AND GLUED IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	ONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALS ONE TEN CENT TO BE A
Line_4019	THAT'S WHAT THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTIMETER ONE TWO THREE FOR SIX AN NINE TEN ON THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHAT DOES SKA- ONE MILLIMETERS
Line_4022	OKAY I
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE I DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THEN
Line_4024	OKAY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT'S D
Line_4025	I KNOW BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FOR I SAY THOSE
Line_4026	E HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LEADER S NO CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPARE VIALS YEAH HAH THAT'S LIKE WHAT OURS WE'RE
Line_4029	UM A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUAL TO ONE LITER AND TO
Line_4030	NOT I I KNOW LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT IT WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	UBUMEDIEAH LA THE SUCH THING AS A KILOLITER I I THINK
Line_4032	LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	NOAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UH YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM USES A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GERVAUM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLOWLE TRAVEL EQUALS A MILLOWLE A MILLIMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD SIGN THE CUPS THAT LOOK LIKE THEN AND YOU WOULD POUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	WE H WELL I WANNA DO GRAJURITE YEAH OP
Line_4040	YEAH YOU CALL THOSE THOSE STICKS WHOOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT HELPS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	PANT THIS IS ON BACK CURADGE THAT'S WHY IT'S SOME FALLING OFF
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NETHER WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET THE TEACHER HAS ONLY SHOW IN US WE DID THE VIAL THING AND THEN THE TEL HAS ALSO SHOWED US BUT
Line_4046	HEY CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE AND THE JUST THING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF VILE AND SOME PEOPLE SAY ONCE TO A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LETTERS OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUID THE VOLUME OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WIDTH OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	MMM WHAT THE SAY I SEEN PINK AT TENT NERICING YOU BY THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT OF THE S STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTHS HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND LENGTHS
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE A HARRY GOOD NO NO THAT ONE WHAT DID WE DO THIS WORK
Line_4056	THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSANDTH OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OF IT
Line_4057	WHY ISN'T O TEN
Line_4058	LIKE THE REACHING UM PROBLY THE THERE THE LESS ONE OF THE S
Line_4059	I WOULD ONLY THEY ARE PROBABLY A HUNDRED
Line_4060	M WHAT'S YOU IN IN THE BANK A YEAH UM BLEED EITHER A ONE OF THOSE TWO
Line_4061	M UH MODE LIKED WHY WHAT WERE YOU PRACHING WHAT WERE YOU SO COLD WHAT WERE YOU SAY IN S
Line_4062	UM TROPASPABOLE MILLALITERS
Line_4063	WELL BUT I WANT TO SEE THE FIRST ONE I DON'T FORGET THE H
Line_4064	NO WE WEREN'T USING VIALS WE USED VIALS A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH MMM WELL NO WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
Line_4066	MMM NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE A B LINE A SEE LINE A D LINE
Line_4067	THE SCREEN IS A THING THAT SORT IS STUCK OF WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THERE THAT YOU STUCKED UP
Line_4068	ON WELL BYE THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH IT'S NOT
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS THE LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BRI-
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VIALS WERE DIFFERENT YEAH MILLILITERS S
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADUATED CYLINDER BUT THOSE ONE'S HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LITER B
Line_4074	UM HOW MANY OH THAT'S A THOUSAND ON THAT BIG THING AND THE ONE LITER
Line_4075	OR IS THE SOIL CAN THE INTERACTIVE SODA CAN I I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES NO
Line_4076	NO BUT WA A HUNDRED NOLLY THAT LOOKS NET EQUILS
Line_4077	TWO A HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADURATED SYLNDERS EQUAL WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT CALLED IS WHAT I WONDERING OH TWE-
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONE'S WIDE IF YOU FLATTENED THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER S
Line_4081	WELL EM ELSTOWNS STANDS FOR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER AND TWENTIETH THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
Line_4082	YOU WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER IS LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LIGHT ENOUGH TO IS THE YOU'RE
Line_4083	H YE A
Line_4084	UM UM UH HEY NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WON'T LOOK AT THAT IN THAT SAIL MAN TO REACT DOSING IT I WAS
Line_4086	STAMLIIAND TRACT OF LAW
Line_4087	IT'S INTERACTIVE OR AND SODA HUH LIKE THE DONE SODA
Line_4088	BUT I WANT A READY TAPE MY TONSOLES
Line_4089	IT'S ME AND A FONENES
Line_4090	THE ONE THAT WENT NOT WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
Line_4091	BY YEAH
Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND SAID TO A CARPENDER
Line_4093	U I WANT I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED OUT A GROCERY STORE INSIDE YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIPS S
Line_4095	UM A POLES PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD USE A MAN HE COULD'VE USED BIG
Line_4096	PONDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	SO I SAY ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTED ONE POUND THE SOME THING I
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED AT THE UHM UNIT ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UM
Line_4100	AND A PLASTIC CHIP AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	UH UH GOOD TO USE SHORT MEASURE I MEAN WAIT
Line_4102	IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE THE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	ONE WOULD BE SMALL AND ONE WOULD BE HUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND GROUP WOULD BE S
Line_4107	WITH THE RULERS TAPE MEASURED
Line_4108	WELL MOST DRILL MOST DRILLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAME LENGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A WILLAR WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURER BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULDN'T USE MET METERS
Line_4112	I NOTICE A HUNDRED A HUNDREDTH OF A CENTERIMETER
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ARM AND A METER
Line_4114	MY DAD MEASURES WIT UM BUILDS BUILDING SO HE USES HOW LA IS THIS STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A Y KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE SERIAL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TILL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD HE WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE THE
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPES WOULD UM MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	OKA THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_4121	UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURES IT MEASURES ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHERS
Line_4123	UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT T
Line_4124	LIKE COMPUTERS DOOR S BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOORS ARE UH CAN BE
Line_4126	WIDER THEN TAPED THEN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UH RULERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BING STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WABLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE IT THE CORRECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETER'S IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERS SO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED SI I METERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS I CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	I COULD
Line_4135	Y YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN UH MILLIMETERS AND THE CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T KNOW YOU
Line_4138	NO MIRALHLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPONGES SPUNGES THEY SOAK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEAN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS OR MEASURING TOOLS
Line_4141	AN THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURED OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNTIL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVEL
Line_4143	SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN ITS LIKE THIS AND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM TO ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRETTY BALANCED RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COUNT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPONGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPONGE YOU WAIT UNTIL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MESCEY M
Line_4147	UM HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT UH A DRY SPONGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THE PUT THE GRAMS AND ONE BY ONE AGAIN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TO IF IT'S LIKE A HEAVY IT UM YOU CAN GO BY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOU'D TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TOO HEAVY ON YOU PUT IN ANOTHER FIVE YOU'D TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOUR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	UM THE DRY SPUNGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN YOU REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4153	UM THE L
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHT SO
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT T
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGHT TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	AN THE END THE DRY SPUNGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	UH IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE PUT UNEVENLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIG SPONGE COULD HUM MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY UH NO
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT A
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG AND SOAKED IT'S GOING TO BE JAGANTIC
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANNA GO ONE ONES ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO IDEA WELL YOU HAD A GO IDEA
Line_4166	THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN A ORANCHE
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAY BE TOO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILGRAAN
Line_4169	MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVIER
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSEL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	MILLEGRIEN I THINK THERE IS THESE THINGS CALLED MILLIGRAMS I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILOGRAM O YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WES A METER IT'S LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LANCY FROM
Line_4175	TEXISM FROM HERE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS AMAZING YEAH AH YEAH

Line_4404	MEASURING WATER BOTTLES
Line_4405	WE HAVE BEEN
Line_4406	AND WHOSE HER DO YOU PUT LIKE UM WATER AND SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THE HUH
Line_4407	THERE WERE WAS BOYS AND MY GROUP ONLY BOYS AND THE UM GIRLS I WAS JUST THE ONLY GIRL IN THAT GROUP MMM

Line_4412	UM BUT HOW MUCH WATER DOES IT TAKE IN THE SODA CAM
Line_4413	THAT IT HAD WATER ON THE SO WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
Line_4414	UM THAT YOU WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RIGHT THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WAIT NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINK CUP YEAH
Line_4417	U MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CANS AND HOW MUCH WATER COULD TAKE
Line_4418	UM LIKE A
Line_4419	Y I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	PEA LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO I IT COULDN'T DROP THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER
Line_4422	I DON'T KNOW WE JUST DID THAT T

Line_4430	N IT'S THE THE SAME NUMBER YEAH
Line_4431	UM I LEARNED THAT
Line_4432	THAT AMERICA S D ONLY A ICE THAT DOESN'T USE THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM
Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE A IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THE IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT E NOT ALL STRAWS OF THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS S
Line_4438	WERE THEY SOME OF THEM WERE CENTERED BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE CUT IT OUT THE WE COULDN'T WELL UM ONCE WE CUT IT OUT THE METER TAPE WE
Line_4440	UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH BUT UM WE
Line_4442	MEASURED UH THE BOOK SHELLS
Line_4443	BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE CLOSER THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO R
Line_4444	NO
Line_4445	WELL UM LIKE I SAID WE TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WILL ONE TENCH SIX AND T
Line_4446	AND NEEDS NO
Line_4447	IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IT NEVER CHANGES S
Line_4448	BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE LITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT IN THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
Line_4449	IT WAS NONE I MEAN THREE MMM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS I
Line_4451	IT'S OR NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STAND THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THINGS
Line_4454	UM THE GRAM'S
Line_4455	LIKE I SAID THESE WERE LIKE THE CUBES THE ONE AND THE FIVE T
Line_4456	UM IT'S TO FIND IT BY SEE
Line_4457	YES THE THE CHIPS
Line_4458	YES YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE RESULTS WERE A MILES
Line_4459	YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNTS
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOMETIMES
Line_4461	IT UHM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CLUB BLUE JUST USED PAPER CLIPS INSTEAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRIED TO GET WITH OUR THE GRAM'S WE TRIED TO GET
Line_4464	INSTEAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL THOSE BULBS WE COULD JUST USE
Line_4465	THEN THAT TEN THAT
Line_4466	AT TEN AND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE HOOKS THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	H KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TURNS DURING A SO IT TOOK LONGER AND SO JUST ONE PERSON
Line_4470	YEAH AND ONE TIME IT WAS LIKE AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS THAT SIX TAN IT WAS AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS LIKE EIGHT THEN IT WAS THAT SIX YEAH IT WAS FIRED

Line_4480	THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN ENDED AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN S
Line_4481	UM WELL I HAN
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCER
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLEWOAPPY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S A
Line_4485	A BIG ONE LIKE YEAH BIG ONE IT CELLS A GRAM
Line_4486	WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT THAT
Line_4487	Y YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH WELL FIRST I HOLD UP MY HAND AND I WEIGH IT THEN PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USED
Line_4490	M HU AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL I KNOW
Line_4491	YEAH OH SOOH YEAH
Line_4492	UM I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WEIGHT NOT ALL THE WEIGHT
Line_4494	NOT A FAIR PLEC
Line_4495	YEAH ONE MILL
Line_4496	M ONE HUNDRED AND MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT IT JUST FLIPPED UP A
Line_4498	I THINK IT'S IT'S TRYING TO TRICK US BUT YOU JUST DID THAT W YOUR EAR DID THAT
Line_4499	H OH WELL THEN WE PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
Line_4500	HAT'S A THAT'S UM
Line_4501	THE LIONS WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FOUL IT WOULD BE IT E
Line_4502	YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK IT COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAY
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU USED THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE'S WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND PLASTIC CHIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCALE THING WE HAD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AND IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD YOU PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LOOK OUT EVEN TO
Line_4507	IT UHM THERE'S MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THAT WOULD
Line_4508	HELPS UM H
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TO
Line_4510	MEAT YEAH AND
Line_4511	TAKE OUT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A HUM ONE GRAMS AND THEN WILL GO BUT IT'S FLOWTIN IT'S FLOWING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND HE'S ME
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW I IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CRUES AND GO SOM

Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOAKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHT IT PUT ANOTHER PUT UH THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPONGE STEMS DO NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UMM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	TO GOT WHAT SOAKED UP ALL AS WATER AS IT COULD THEN WE WAITED AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR A MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIXTEEN GRAMS
Line_4526	TO CLEAN BECAUSE IT SHOWS WET AND WITH DIRTY WATER IT WOULD ABSORBED THE DIRTY WATER OR
Line_4527	NO LAND I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMPTY CUP CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
Line_4530	IT HOLDS COAL IS YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAP TO TU WITH THAT YOU CAN'T TU THE PART
Line_4531	ON A KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND VERY KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIKE
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDRED UH FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OF FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONES A HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO KILOGRAM IS PROLY GENEBY IT IS HEAVY AS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAM S ARE TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT WOULDN'T WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THI SO HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OR TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER IS A PIXTURES THIS HEAVY IS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOCAM PLES ONE L OF WATER LITER
Line_4541	YEAH MISS US MISS STOLL A FUN PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPONGE WE UH MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WEIGHT SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPONGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREES FOR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	THAT'S FIVE AND THEN THAT'S ONE THEN
Line_4546	IT WO INSTEAD OF OASE HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	T TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALED OUT SO UM FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS IT CAN OUT AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THEN SHOULD BE SIXTEEN S MAKE IT SO THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S AROLOCK ERUH LOCKET INSIDE OF HIM
Line_4551	AN YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
Line_4552	HUH AND THEY'RE IN THE SPONGE YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER THESE WATER'S HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY R LOCK IT ALL THE ARALOCK IT'S GOING ALL AWAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	E IF YOU ACTUALLY WEIGHT BUT I MOST IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	H OKAY OH YOU WON'T GO BACK UP TO HERE'S
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT UP WITH THE WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCALE AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUITS YOUR VEGETABLES AND ST
Line_4559	PUT THE SCALE AND WEIGHED
Line_4560	YEAH THE LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE N YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM
Line_4561	SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOOLING SAYING SEEING WAY HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	I SEEN A IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GARDEN THEY HAVE TO PUT A GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DO THEY CAN BRAKE
Line_4565	THESE LETRECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROKE GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BASE CELLS ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT A YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCE THE SO
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING ME AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MIXIC A FILTER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU KNOW ON A BOND IT OFF THAT HEIGHT BECAUSE IT STICK AND RIGHT
Line_4571	WE THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR SO GO MAYBE
Line_4572	F HEAVY BULL BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UH DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICKS IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LITTLER THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BO
Line_4577	UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PINGNICK IN THEM
Line_4578	WE W
Line_4579	YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIVE BULBS YOU CAN WILD THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I FILLS MINE OUT PAINT OUT PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BULB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS AND AND THE LITTLE BUL
Line_4583	WHY I THINK THEY GOT IT DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES BECAUSE THEY CUT IT THEM A SHORTER OR LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND SHE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIR PLANE COULD FLY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLIM
Line_4588	I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FINDING YOUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGLING A LOT AND THAT YOU PROPELLER SPONGES
Line_4589	I THINK HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GOING TO GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
Line_4590	BUT IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MICKING AT BALANCING AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PURPLE A KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
Line_4593	O CASE HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METER S YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWDER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUN THE WATTUM IT'S LIKE IN A WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONES SETTING UP MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND A
Line_4597	WELL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNIE
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE EX AXIS THE PENDULUM LENGTH JUST THE PENIAM LIKE THEN NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAM ER PRODICTING WHAT'S FOR THEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETERS SWING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST MU YOU COULD TEST YOUR PREDICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THE PENDULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES S
Line_4603	THE NUMBERS OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PENDULUMS AND BOAT S
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT THINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHECK A PENNY AT THE BULB AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDOMELY YOUR ABOUT WILL TIP IT OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE BUT S COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHERS COULD END THE FOR AND A COULD'VE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
Line_4609	HOW THE PENNIES WERE STACKED WOULD SAY A WOULD STACK REALLY SLOFFLY AND D WOULD STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE IS DOWN MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YES S
Line_4612	I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
Line_4613	UH CLART AND YEAH
Line_4614	AND ON WE ALSO IT MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCE IS WAS
Line_4615	O I THINK FLEW
Line_4616	THE UM THE METER STICK HUCK IS TING UP AND AND FLOW
Line_4617	THAT IS DUM AND AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S FLIPPY
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE ONE IT'S POUNCING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND ONTO THE GROUND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKING AIRS PLANES AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HE JI GRA ABOUT PENCILUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PENDULUM HAT IS FIFTY
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LE SIDE UM
Line_4625	AN A NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT HOW MANY SWINGS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF TWAINGE AND THE PEN WHICH ONE THAT LENT IT IS E
Line_4628	WELL WE E WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKE ING THE PLAIN BUT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	YES THEY ARE PLAIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WE'RE MAKING HANG SOME OUT
Line_4630	WE HAD UM A THAT
Line_4631	A LO PADDLE THING FOUR THE WENDSING FOR THE FRONT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN IT WHEN THE THE LINE
Line_4633	U HAVEN'T TRIED TO PLAN YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TRIED T YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THANK YOU YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANYTHING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I KNOW I I I CAN REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MIND BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS UH
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRA WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY OURSELVES UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WHAT I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE LINE WOULD BE UM I I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	IT'S GOING YEAH YOU
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARK THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURED IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM LENGTH MAY BE MARKS END HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	UH THE NUMBERS ARE LIGHTED THERE AND UM THE NAME ER IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUMS
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THAT THE BOTTOM DOT OR THE HIGHEST NOT
Line_4646	UM IT'S GO AND WHILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING VAREL THINGS
Line_4648	I S UM STUDY LEARNING ABOUT CATAPULTS
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW L ABOUT IT
Line_4650	IN IN A POPSICLE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THE
Line_4651	THE UM THINK YOU I SEE THAT POPSICAL STICK THAT THINK YOU PUT ON IT SAYS COM HUM THE M
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORE YOU UM THE RUBBERS THE RIBER STOPPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM THAT LOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA I DON'T PU PART
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES BLANK THE LIP STICK
Line_4655	UM JUNE I THINK IT'S
Line_4656	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOATS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM SLOW AND THEY'RE THE OR THEY'LL UM DOWN
Line_4658	TO FLOW ON WATER AND THE UM PEOPLE TOO GET ON THEM AND SEE THAT OTION
Line_4659	SISERS UM WATER AND HAT'S FIT
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD CAR
Line_4661	PEOPLE AND UM PEOPLES
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD'VE FILL IT HOUND IT
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION RAREING ABOUT
Line_4664	A LOT OF PENNIES UM THERE'S SOME PENNIES AND THEN THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWING ON WATER
Line_4665	THEY REMIND ME OF LIKE THE PENNIES BEING PASCANGERS
Line_4666	I'M WE'RE REMINDING ABOUT HOW MANY PENNIES WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT EXTINCT
Line_4667	T WIG CLOSES UP IT SINKS FASTER BECAUSE E
Line_4668	BECAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM A HIGH
Line_4669	YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHT I'M
Line_4670	HOW CAN UM CHASE THE IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM THE BIG ONES CARRY MORE BECAUSE THE C IT'S A TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CAN CARRY MORE S AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CARRY CASE THAT CAN SMALLER
Line_4672	BECAUSE IT'S SHORT AND AND OUT AND IT COULD UM
Line_4673	THINK IT'S ISH IT'S ISH LIKE THAT CAN LIKE THE KIND OF STRING YOU YOUSED TO CATCH FISH
Line_4674	I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T LIKE IN STRING TO FIGHT IT
Line_4675	IT DIDN'T REALLY SHOW YOU THAT TIMES
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON ON THE STRING YOU WOULD TO A CHAIR THEN PUT THE ARE PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ON IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT PIG
Line_4677	IT DRIPS IN MORE AIR SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN THEY CAN FLESH FASTER
Line_4678	THAT THE REPEL OR IT WOULDN'T FLIGHT BECAUSE YOU ANY UNIT TO SPIN AND THE RUBBER BUM WOULD HAVE NO WHERE TO UM TO
Line_4679	SO AND THE CUMPIETOR NICED IT ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKES THE BAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF THE PROPEL AND TO BURN AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THERE ARE TWO AIR PLAINS AND THERE UH A STRING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S CANDLE FLING DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR THE THE THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GOING T NEED WEIGH MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RIVER BENDS UM SWINGS LIKE TELLS AROUND UM THE PARPELLAR IS GOING SO YOU CAN'T GET MORE AIR
Line_4686	THERE ARE TWO EIGHT AIRPLANES UM THEIR CANDLE
Line_4687	LAKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS CAN LIKE HANGING IT ROUND LIKE NOT THAT TIGHT
Line_4688	THIS GRAB IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SCIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAFTING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULD
Line_4690	WELL IF IT CAN FLOW DID AND THE ROUT'S RING ALWAYS
Line_4691	IT WAS ABOUT SEYING HOW FAR IT THE LID EARTH WILL THE COURT WOULD GO
Line_4692	I THOUGHT LIKE A WRAP AR
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENDS OR C LIKE SNOW S
Line_4694	THEY WERE MAIN ING ABOUT HOW YOU I HAD TO IT SO WE FASTER SLOWER MIXED
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENDULUMS AND HOW THEY SQWINING AND
Line_4696	THE GRAPH IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USED ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ALREADY SWANG OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PREDICTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL ANOTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN IT WELL
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE FLOAT THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
Line_4701	RUBBER BAND IN IT JUST THE PROPELLER BAL LEAVE AND SPIN WHENEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRAB WITH AN EX AND WY AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS ON THE Y AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EX AXIS S
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASSANGERS ON THE AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE WIRE AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU GATHERED UP IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL UM I I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT I THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONE AND GO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSANAGERS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	WHY Y AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS I
Line_4713	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE GRANDFATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TYPES THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES OUT ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECOND GOES AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS THE SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSITE SIDES IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MAKES IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLAINS THAT WE ARE MADE
Line_4722	M JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEIR CHINAL LIKE CATAPULTS YOU PUSH DOWN
Line_4724	MAH THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKES YOU ABLE TO SHOOT
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW THAT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	EARN WHAT I THINK IS THE HAIR THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOOT
Line_4728	IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIER THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WE Y SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRETTY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPPER BRACE IS WHERE YOU'D PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK YOU'D PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTH OF THE STICKS ARE EACH CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECTS
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIGHER OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPER SPACE AND WITH SHOOTING FLIPPER PACES WITH SHOOTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON A PLASTIC I ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HI IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS I
Line_4738	H THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAY S
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS AND TODAY WE DID HELP DOES THE LENGTH OF A STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BE BECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A LOT H A LOT SHORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID A TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW M MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	AND STUDYING PENDULUMS
Line_4749	THEY KEEP I'M KIND OF LIKE ON A GRANDFATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED A YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'D SINK THE BOAT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU'D TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TINY BIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WAN TO BE AS ACCURATE AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFE BOYS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	U ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIMES
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE ON THIRSDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TOO HARD IT MIGHT THINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK EROLLIER THAN USUAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAIN S
Line_4763	THE HIGHER THE CAPACITY OF THE BOOT
Line_4764	HE HIGHER OR THE MORE PASSANGERS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAFRED ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE WIRE LINE WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS AND THE EX LINE WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASSANGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PACEANGERS IT COULD HOLE
Line_4769	EX IS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT I AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THE
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENT FI IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PACEANGERS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANY ONCE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND THE PAPERCLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKES THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT CAN GET THE UH THE MORE TIMES TO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPER CLIP THE PENNY AND THE PENCIL
Line_4779	UH THE STING GOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THEY ALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PENNY USE I GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE FASTER IT L SWING SIDEWAYS
Line_4783	STUDYING UH THE WELL SOMETHING I I FORGET
Line_4784	U SWINGING SIDEWAYS
Line_4785	THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	ITCH HANGING FROM A TABLES
Line_4787	WE SWUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT COULD SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFTY IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	UH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UH IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT WOULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID BUT THE LAST STARTING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT I
Line_4794	I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTHS
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATAPOULDS
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPPER BASE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE WICK GOES AFTER YOU LAUNCH IT T
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CORK UH LIKE SLID
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND IT TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LAUNCHED THE CORK
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO A LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIRST STICK
Line_4802	THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE WICK WAS LAUNCHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN EACH THE CORK
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LAUNCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO A FARTHER
Line_4805	I I NOTICE THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT FIRTHER BECAUSE THE CORKS WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	UH THE WAIT OF THE CORK MAKES THEM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENDULUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PENNY AND THEY IT MAKES THE PENNY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF- IT SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S DRAFT TO SEE HOW LONG THE PENDULENESS
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM THE BIGGEST TO THE LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU TAKE A ESTIMATE IS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SUBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS GETTING SLOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRINGS
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND IT'LL STOLL IN THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULDN'T SEE OUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID STUFF ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UH I DON'T FROM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UH PENNIES ARE LIKE PASANGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL UH IF THERE IS MORE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE AND THAN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
Line_4825	SOME ONES DROPPING MORE PENNIES IN TO THE BOAT T
Line_4826	MAKE SHORE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BULB
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIZES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING ME A GRA- ABOUT UH BOTHS
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THEN THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE OUR BUNCH THINGS IT
Line_4831	MI IT WOULD LIKE SINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4834	I FIGURED OUT THAT UH THE BIGGER THE LIFE BUMPS THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOAT IS S
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PENNIES LIKE RE FITTING IN EACH BOAT
Line_4837	A IS THE BIGGEST SO IT'LL HOLD MORE PASSANGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PENNIES IT CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PATANGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WHICH IS MILE
Line_4840	UH WELL THEY SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST TO LETEST OR LEATEST EAST TO GREATEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE A HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THAT IT THE NUMBERS RAISING UP
Line_4843	THE EXACT SEES IS THE WHERE THE CAPACITY MILLIMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PACEANGERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EXAXCESS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE WE AXCESS IS ON SO TO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WIDE AXES SHOWS HOW MANY PASANGERS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE WE AXES IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOAT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALL OR PENNIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOAT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4850	I NOTICED THAT THE THE NUMBER OF THE CAMPACO THE PACANGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GREW
Line_4851	IT EITHER GOT THE PASSANGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT T SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH TOO THE DIFFERENCES AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL E X IS NUMBER OF MOTORS THE RIVER BANDS AND WHY IS A DISTANCE
Line_4854	BANDS UH GO PRITTY FAR
Line_4855	WELL IT'S PLACED LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE SO WILL BE EASIER LISTS
Line_4856	WELL YOU PLACE THE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF ER AND THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE GOING THERE SO IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RIBER BANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASTANGERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSANGERS THE DISTANCE WILL AND IT WON'T GO S FAR
Line_4859	A FEW DAYS AGO WE LITTLE PAPER EROPLINES
Line_4860	UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENNY
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE CHANGED O MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PENTCULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4863	SOMETHING'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF IT'S SHORTER IT WILL GO FATSLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY VARIABLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CAME TO ANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONED RE THE LATER TIME
Line_4869	THE SHORTER IT GETS FAT THE MORE SWINGS IT THAT TAKES
Line_4870	ACTUALLY THE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS HAS
Line_4871	UM LET'S SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONES
Line_4872	IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRING IS THE HAIRS THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PREDICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND THE HER OF THE FLIPPERS
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH OF WHAT WE DID SO FINE WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MORON
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CORK AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH IT AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR WILL GO
Line_4876	THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THE CORK IS WHERE ORGAN LAUNCH AND THEN THE REVERT STOPPER HELPS THE STICK UP AND THE
Line_4877	A I'M NOT SURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE S SLIPPER BASE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RUBBER STOP
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A PICTURE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4880	YEAH THE WEIGHT MY UM AFFECTS HOW FAR IT GOES S
Line_4881	YEAH WILL POLVERY TRI A AND O ON THE S TO MORON
Line_4882	OR WELL WE MAKE EITHER A GRAMS OR OR WELL PROBABLY MAKE A CHART
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER IT CAN TIP IT BEFORE IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO A MIXTURE THERE IS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY ALL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
Line_4886	HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOME IT MIGHT HAVE BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UH WHAT'S SAY
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KINDA JUST DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT YOU NO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM CAN EVERY WALL SINK FASTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UH MIGHT NOT A
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THE NOT AS TALLER AND IT WILL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONCE ABOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BOATS CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOUT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY UH
Line_4897	CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER O OR LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4899	NO IF THEY ARE WRONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU TACK UM ONE ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO THINK IF YOU STUCK EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD BE
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ARM MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG OF STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S POSE TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE WILL UNDER BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	ES I SEE UM A WHERE'S
Line_4905	THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT THE PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOLTS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATERS THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	WE MUST WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HULT
Line_4908	TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH AIR IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH NO
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THELL HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLDS MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL A BUG IS
Line_4913	U DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SETTLE IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLDS MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE WE'LL THINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STACK EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE L SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER IS TOO RUG THE BOAT COULDN'T TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S COM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN IT WILL STAY UP
Line_4917	HE THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE THEM A SMALLER A BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
Line_4919	THAT UN WE KIN
Line_4920	ACCITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PASCANGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRASS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONES COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING HER IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HELP MORE BUT IF YOU PUT THEM ALL TO THE SIDE'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLT
Line_4926	IT'S CAPACITIES W HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD A HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND A
Line_4929	THAT THE CAPACITY GETS HIRE SO IT IS THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS
Line_4930	THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PAANGERS
Line_4931	HIGHER IT GETS MORE PACANGIERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	UH IT SO IT'S
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PACEANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW WE COULD WHEN WE SPENT HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PRPELAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS A PRAPELAR UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLOAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KINDA STREAM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND UP THE PERPELLAR
Line_4938	WELL MEAN MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING IN THE AND WE LEARN THAT IF YOU PUT A TEN IT
Line_4939	EFFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLO
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THEY BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TWO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOR SIX AT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE FIBER IT OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS IT HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GOES SLOWER AND IT WILL GO LESS FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WINDS IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE PAPERCLIPS
Line_4945	WELL TH MORE THE LESS PASSANGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSANGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT EFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS S
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF THAT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKES IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FINGER IT OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE
Line_4949	ELL IT'S LIKE YOU TICK OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS AND WHEN YOU FETCHA THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPERCLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICE THAT WITH UM AND WITH
Line_4952	MORE WITH MORE PAST AS YOU ADD MORE PASSANGERS THE LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ARE AROUND THAT T
Line_4954	T THE NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RUBBER BANDS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PACE ER AND AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID IN M
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS TO CHANGES WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE I SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DESKS AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN JUST LIKE GO OF THE IT COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE S SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TR- OH YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THE M
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND T HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I A STINK SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_4968	THE FLIP STICK AND I
Line_4969	IT SHOWS HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMITIERS
Line_4970	I SEE WHEN Y UM CLICK IT'S GOING FURTHER
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE HALF THINGS WHAT EXPELMENT IT MADE S WHETHER IT IS
Line_4972	WARMTH AND YEAH TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE OFF THINGS ILL THE EXPLIMENT MIGHT BE WRONG AND YOU'LL NOT SHOW IF IT NOT
Line_4974	IT EFFECTS THE WILL DISSULT BECAUSE YOU UH YOU
Line_4975	IT TOOK HALF SHOELINE
Line_4976	IT'S CONTINENT BY TENT UM IT'S MOVING UP BY CELIMETERS
Line_4977	IT'S SAYING THIER AND HIKER
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO IT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE S STRING
Line_4980	S SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TOO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WE UM MEASURE IT AND UH I
Line_4983	UH MEASURING TAPE
Line_4984	WE KEPT THE PENNY AND THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE L THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE MOTION AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSANGERS AND SOMETIMES EMERGENCY LUGAGE
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DREW A ACROSS
Line_4987	WE BUILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUP UPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANCE SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	T CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZE
Line_4990	S SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PINKIES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIDE THE PLACE WENT OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNIE
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I FIGURED THAT UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT VALUE FARRIABULES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PAANGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOATS WERE
Line_4999	H HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WEIGHT
Line_5000	WE DID BI US DOING EVERYTHING WITH EVERYBODY BAKING THEIR BOATS PRETTY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGHS HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE Y AXIS IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS THE BOOT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT FART THEY CALL MINE
Line_5005	T WHICH WORDS
Line_5006	I I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW WEAR YOUR BULBS CHANGED THINGS
Line_5008	THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PACANGEERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	S THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS SMALLER TWO SO PRETTY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BYE MARNI HAVE A NICE STICK
Line_5011	Y HUH MY NAME IS CATCHER AND I AM NINE YEARS OLD WE USED HOLE A QUESTION
Line_5012	CAPAPHNIA MEASUREMENT DECLINE AND SOMIT
Line_5013	TO ABOUT HEIGHT A I FORGOT
Line_5014	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A RULER A A METER STICK
Line_5016	HEY ARE TWO ABS
Line_5017	AND TALL AND AND THEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WELL UHM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	H I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOUR
Line_5021	I YOU ER A WE
Line_5022	THE DOORKNOB ON THE PIXTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEED THE M
Line_5024	I FORGOT SORRY
Line_5025	I SWEET ONE METER TEN METERS A HUNDRED METERS AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	OU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WIDTH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN RULERS
Line_5028	A DARN B MEAN A KNOB ON A D WORK
Line_5029	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A RULER
Line_5030	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE THE
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN UMM ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BUBBLES YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IT IS TEN SATTANL AND ARS UM IN THIS PICTURE
Line_5034	ALLOWS HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS TALL IN ALL
Line_5035	THREES CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A WOALLER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE MORE S MOST MORE COMAN
Line_5037	THIS BOY IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEEDED
Line_5039	WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS YARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A MADE OR TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER A NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THE M
Line_5043	SOME ARE THE SAME WIND
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU COULD USE A RULER OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	Y YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN METER STICKS AND ROUGLERS
Line_5047	IT DID NOT KNOW
Line_5048	YOU CAN WEIGH ON THEM WITH THE SKY
Line_5049	I DO NOT THE WHOLE
Line_5050	WELL THERE WEIGHTS THAT ARE A LIKE COLLE WHAT A BASTLIGHT IS
Line_5051	IS HEAVIER THAN CHIPS
Line_5052	METAL IS HEAVIER THAN CLASS DOG AND
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST WAS THE EDGE OF THE MAGNET THEN THE THEN WOULDN'T AND THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE JUST
Line_5054	I DON'T WANT HOLD THE ANSWER S SO I LIKE QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING FAN YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR THAT WOULD SEE THEN T MAKE IT MEASURED WITH THING SO IT'S A LITER METAL
Line_5056	THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THE CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BALANCED IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURES SHOW ME THAT NOT THE METAL WASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THE N
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULD UM Y I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WELL UM IT'S MORE A CURRENTS
Line_5061	WOUND IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT A METAL
Line_5062	WELL MEASURING IT'S SOLELY BUT WELL I FORGET NOT
Line_5063	WEED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THOSE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5065	WELL A SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE IN AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIPS SMALL ONE PAPER CUPS BIG
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HAPPIEST AND ONE'S NOT HAVING
Line_5068	THE LITTLE CUBE IN FROM ME AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAMS
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS OR GRAMS ALL WILL WEIGH UNTIL INCINETY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	I THIS PICTURE TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THAT METAL WASHER
Line_5072	ON SEVEN SIX FIVE MORE THREE SO ONE THEN THE METAL WASHER GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE A
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAM TEN GRAM TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	ME WHAT GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	OK A UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	HUH I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5078	I DO UM E AND ME THEY OUGHT ME GOOD AR
Line_5079	I DON'T NA EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERENCES WHAT IT ME
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS F FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THERE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	ITS IS EIGHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKE SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TO MEASURE THAT CHANG KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	UH UH U THE IDEAS NO NO
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TOO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVEN USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WHAT AH I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SCIENCE
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASURE A MEASURE MEN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
Line_5092	ALL WAYS A METER ARE OH I'M MEAN MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE CORES OF WATER AND MAYBE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S LINES AND THAT COULD PROBABLY TELL ME HOW MUCH IT COULD E HOLD
Line_5095	VILE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND BY A ONE COULD HOLD MORE LIKE TWICE THAT MUCH A BILE TWO
Line_5096	WELL THAT VILE COULD POP GROUPS
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET TO HUNT THE RESULTS THAT WAY Y
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER'S HOLDING A THOUSAND NIWALITERS OR ONE ONLY KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW H HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH IT CAN
Line_5100	I I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOWS IS ONE MILLILITER
Line_5102	UM MILLILITERS HO SHOWN'T HOLD OR HOW IT COULD BE WITH THE LINE'S
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE BIG FAT TO B THING THOUSAND MILLILITER S
Line_5104	IT TAKES TEN LITTLE TWO BES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MIL ER
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BAKE A KICK YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS S
Line_5106	UM WELL I I FORGOT
Line_5107	MILLOMETER IS BIGGER AND A LITER IS SNAWLE
Line_5108	YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS FEL INCHES MILLIMETERS OR LITER'S
Line_5110	THEY COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEEDED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT
Line_5112	THERE'S MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS IN THE RANGE
Line_5113	OH IT COULD BE USED FOR UM CENTER
Line_5114	UM WELL OLD HOME WE WOULD PUT THE WATER AND THE ERIN AND WE WOULD SPREAD IT INTO SOMETHING TO SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
Line_5115	A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS THREE CRANES T T FILL
Line_5116	ELCILIOMINDE CANT CAR YEAH
Line_5117	IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS AND FILLS CUP WITH IT
Line_5118	CAN SHOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE HOW MUCH IT WILL WHOOP BUT WELL WHEN L WE STOP FIFTY MILLILITERS
Line_5119	THE LINES REPRESENT HOW MANY WALL
Line_5120	IT IS A ALAJURATED SOUNDERA
Line_5121	THE IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN HOLD A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5122	UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER AND OR THE LIQUID'S IN IT
Line_5123	WELL THERE'S MORE GRADUATED SILENDERS THAT ARE FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND MILLILITERS S
Line_5124	WELL I DON'T KNOW HAVE TO FIND THE UM
Line_5125	WOULD BE PRODICT YOU COULD MAKE A AN ESTIMATE UM MAKE A LINE AND SEE IF IT WILL GO OVER UNDER
Line_5126	UM ESTIMATING IS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN ASK
Line_5127	A TO LIKE TAKE A WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
Line_5128	WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL TO WA AND LAND AND WON'T MARS SEE
Line_5129	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDIED ABOUT CAPACITY
Line_5130	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I I'M ABSERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5131	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY AND HOW TALL
Line_5132	THE CUP IN MOUTH HAS MORE AND THAN A WIDE
Line_5133	ALL UH A C CAPACITY'S SO NOT ALL I KNOW
Line_5134	UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A WATER AND A CONTAINER AND FILL IT S CAPACITY
Line_5135	S IS TWO HUNDRED MILLI OR A VESL
Line_5136	THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL HOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIRE FAT OR SKINNIER AND IT COULD JUST DON'T HOLD THE SAME THING
Line_5137	WELL EVERY ONE EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU PUT IN IT'S A HUNDRED AND EQUALS TO HUNDRAMNILLILITORS WATER
Line_5138	WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLD THE SAME METAL WATERS
Line_5139	WIT UM HU
Line_5140	I I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
Line_5141	THIS IS NOT A MILLLY BUT IT IT IS A GRADJUATANE AND SOUND ER
Line_5142	SCILANDER
Line_5143	AND USING UM SORRY
Line_5144	A CUP ON THE LEFT HAS MORE WATER AND THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS WATER
Line_5145	YOU CAN DISK A ROW ENGINE PANEL I WANT A THOUGH WHAT'S MORE
Line_5146	IT GETS RANGE R R YOU CAN S A CERMAN PUT IT ON FIFTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTY TWELVE FILL UP
Line_5147	THE MORNCHEES FUN
Line_5148	YOU MOST A THREE HUNDRED THERE IS THREE MILLILITER'S
Line_5149	WELL IT IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MET
Line_5150	USING THE WALLS USING THE
Line_5151	S IS HOW MUCH A WHOLES
Line_5152	OH I OBSERVED A MOLLUM
Line_5153	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5154	HENCE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN CAPACITY TO THE VERY TIPPY TOP P
Line_5155	HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN CAPACITY
Line_5156	I DON'T KNOW
Line_5157	YOU MAY L SEE THIS HOLE RE A CAT
Line_5158	IT CAN HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS CAN HOLD THAT WATCH THAT'S HOW IT SH
Line_5159	I DON'T KNOW I SO THAT I
Line_5160	THE CAMITA BECAUSE WELL TWO DIFFERENT THING THREE LIKE S AND
Line_5161	ONE GOT TO HOLD FIFTY ONE COULD ONLY A HUNDRED ONE AN A THOUSAND WHICH ONE LITER
Line_5162	ALLY WHAT'S GOING ON IS
Line_5163	I I DON'T KNOW
Line_5164	I THINK A JUST FROM GOOD
Line_5165	IT HOLDS A HUNDRED M MILLILITERS
Line_5166	YOU COULD USE THE LINER S OR BEAKERS OR CENTIMENAS LIKE THE
Line_5167	CINNISI ORANGES
Line_5168	OU PULL IT UP AND THE WATER FALLS
Line_5169	OH IT'S HAVE FLOAT RIGHT NOW
Line_5170	MEASURE LIKE A PACINTY
Line_5171	O A HUNDRED FORTY A THREE HUNDRED HORN
Line_5172	H YOU HAD UP HOW MUCH WATER WOULD HOLD AND IT'S HOLDING UP
Line_5173	BECAUSE THE WATER WAS JUST ON IT COULD
Line_5174	AND WELL CELLS ALL AND
Line_5175	TH THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
Line_5176	UM WELL EVERY SINGLE MINUTES THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED WITH THE WITH THE CUP WITH THE ICE IN IT
Line_5177	I FORGOT THAT IT
Line_5178	WELL IT ONLY THAT'S COLD AND IT CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
Line_5179	WELL WE DID UM WELL EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD HACK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT OUR THING
Line_5180	UM WE PUT IT UM HOW MUCH SOLCERS
Line_5181	IT SAYS FIFTY THEN
Line_5182	WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A P FOUR
Line_5183	WELL THEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IN
Line_5184	E OBSERVED TEN MINUTES
Line_5185	WELL IT CHANGES BECAUSE MISS OLD AND YOU A LITTLE FREE
Line_5186	UM IT GOES UP AND IT GOES DOWN
Line_5187	HI CLCIES AND YEAH
Line_5188	CAN TELL YOU
Line_5189	WELL YOU SHOULD STREMILEY SEE THE I LIKE YOU COULD CAN YOU WAIT UP TIL WE'RE GOT THE
Line_5190	IT BLOWS ER AT SILCHEA
Line_5191	ONE OF THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS TWENTY
Line_5192	BUT WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GRASS IN IT AND AND THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO UP
Line_5193	CALLED ON MILL AREA AND IT'S GOING ON GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
Line_5194	OH MY NAME IS SARA UM I REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
Line_5195	YES AND THEN REALLY EXCITED DID IT START
Line_5196	WE'VE BEEN DOING MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
Line_5197	UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE
Line_5198	UM LIKE IS UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
Line_5199	THEY MAY COME UP WITH A DECISION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT STANDARD
Line_5200	IT SHOWS HOW LONG A METER IS AND UM H HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
Line_5201	MORE USED IN SCIENTIFIC STUDY FOR LIKE REALLY LONG THINGS A REALLY SHORT THINGS A YEAH
Line_5202	ALONG THE DOOR KNOB A IT'S FROM THE FLOOR
Line_5203	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE ELECTRIC IST- OF THE WORLD
Line_5204	WELL WHAT OUR TEACHER SAYS IS USED HER PINKIE FIRST CENTIMETERS AND UHM I PINKIE FOR ADDRESSITOVES
Line_5205	N THE SAME I DON'T KNOW
Line_5206	WELL THIS IS AN OLD SAYING PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND I HAD TO AGREE WITH IT
Line_5207	UHM PREY GOOD
Line_5208	WITH LIKE A METER OR RULER OR YARD STICK
Line_5209	TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS OR REALLY SMALL THINGS
Line_5210	YOU GET A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATES
Line_5211	WE MEASURED UM TO ARM FOOT M
Line_5212	ROUBE'S NOSE IS ONE PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIE'S FINGERS FINGER LEGS
Line_5213	I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT REFERENCE IS
Line_5214	UM I I DON'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER PARTY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONES I'VE TOLD YOU
Line_5215	WE'VE BEEN SENDING THE STANDARDS SO TO AND OTHER SUSTANTS
Line_5216	O I LECAMPARING MASS WE DO MASS
Line_5217	YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE METAL IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE HEAVIEST T
Line_5218	THAT YOU COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND IN OR ANYWHERE
Line_5219	UM MEASUREMENTS MORE ACCURATELY THAN A THAT
Line_5220	EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHS
Line_5221	TWO GROUPS OR PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIPS
Line_5222	HAVE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5223	WORLDS GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS
Line_5224	THE UH
Line_5225	RE ALONE YOU HAD TO EXPOITIN
Line_5226	DOCKS WE USE SCREAM BLOCKS
Line_5227	UM GRAND OH I OH
Line_5228	ONE THE CLIP ECLES ONE GRAM B
Line_5229	UM I THINK IT OUTS

Line_5234	WHICH I'M SORRY FOR THE POSE STICK POSE
Line_5235	WEIGHT WEIGHING
Line_5236	GRAMS ARE ABOUT UM UH ALL ABOUT UM
Line_5237	UM SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRAND CUTS
Line_5238	UM I DON'T SAY MANY THINGS
Line_5239	GRAMS ARE UM AN UNIT OF MASS OF WEIGHT
Line_5240	THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH GRAM PAST
Line_5241	HAIL
Line_5242	UM THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THE
Line_5243	YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS AN YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT IS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
Line_5244	IT'S THE SMALGER I'M GUESSING
Line_5245	O IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAND
Line_5246	WEIGHING HEAVER ER THINGS I
Line_5247	ITS IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5248	NOW EVERYBODY YOU WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
Line_5249	UM WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UM DIFFERENT LENGTHS SO MASS
Line_5250	TWICE PUNCHED THAT'S SPUNCH ON THE SPONGE
Line_5251	M IT'S REALLY DRIP AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WEIGHT THAT MUCH
Line_5252	UM IT'S ON TO WEIGH A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE SILK SPONGE
Line_5253	UM I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SOAKED SPONGE OR A WET SPONGE BUT IT'S EVENLY NO I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
Line_5254	WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM LOGICALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF WHERE THE SPUNGE IS BRIGHT
Line_5255	THE DRY SPONGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
Line_5256	UH NOT ONCE I
Line_5257	BUT DRY SPONGES PEA GRAMS
Line_5258	IT IS SIXTEEN
Line_5259	UM YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH A UM
Line_5260	HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGH HI WA
Line_5261	AS GRAMS THI AM GOOD
Line_5262	I MEARIPL
Line_5263	GOOD I
Line_5264	THE SAND LUGNETOFSCA I
Line_5265	YOU COULD WAVY THE BOTTOM
Line_5266	GRAM PIECES AND IN OTHER CUP A LOT OF THING
Line_5267	FOR I LOST A IS THE SAY
Line_5268	ISN'T THEN I VOLT MASSES AND A BALANCE
Line_5269	IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
Line_5270	MEASURE GRAVITY YOU CAN ER A TO THE SMALL OBJECTS WITH THIS
Line_5271	MELTING IT PLAYING IT BY A HUNDREDS
Line_5272	SMALL IT'S
Line_5273	THE THERMOMETERS UM COUNTING BY TURNS THIS IS COUNTING BY ONES AND THIS IS COUNTING BY A HUNDRED S
Line_5274	UH THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN SORRY
Line_5275	ONE HUNDRED
Line_5276	SMALL OBJECTS OR A A LIQUID
Line_5277	COOKING BAKING I OSED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
Line_5278	UM BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME A A MILLIMETER LITERS IT MILLILITERS

Line_5280	IT WELL U MEA MOUNT IT'S A SMALL WAY THEN THE METER
Line_5281	I L A MEASURING CUP A MIRTURING SCORING
Line_5282	A BALANCE
Line_5283	A'S CALLED BUT IT'S USED FOR MEDICINE AND AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
Line_5284	UM BAKING YOU NEED THE A PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TAKES LIKE THAT
Line_5285	THE MILLL LITERS
Line_5286	THE NUMBERS THAT THE CERRANGE HOLES IT THIS REALLY FUN THE SCREW UP
Line_5287	R VOICES ALLOWED TO DAYS BUT I'M GOOD
Line_5288	E USED A SPILL BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW ONE TO UH THREE
Line_5289	ARE MILLIMETERS
Line_5290	WEITED SYLINDER
Line_5291	TO MAKE WATER PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR SMALL OBJECTS
Line_5292	S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACER THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO B ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINS UM W
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HAD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THAN A YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A SORINE YOU COULD BUY SORENDER IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL IT UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT HOW DO I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING TALLER BUT SKINNIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF A WHATEVER
Line_5300	T WILL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM
Line_5301	THEY WE ARE EITHER TALLER BUT SKINNIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDE R
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZERO W
Line_5304	ONE MINUTE SA IT TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN THIER DON'T WHAT ELSE COOL
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER IT GOT TWENTY DEGREES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM P
Line_5308	I WON'T STAND YEAH
Line_5309	WELL SO I AM GOING TO MAKE IT REPEAT
Line_5310	I NEED STAR BOYS FIRST SIN
Line_5311	UM IT CHANGED BILLY QUICKLY I YEAH
Line_5312	WE DREW IT ON GRAMS PAPER
Line_5313	Y YOU HAVE TO UM
Line_5314	LE EXITS OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	W YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UP UP UH THE WE
Line_5317	IT'S TIME HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE IT GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY I'M GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WE HAND IT UP
Line_5321	IT GOT IT WAS STUED AT TWENTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MA HIGH GUESS BY FIVE T
Line_5323	JUST LIKE WING BY TENS OR FIFTEEN
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF IT'S WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT ITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UHM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE AND THE UM THE
Line_5328	COULD BI AM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT FU
Line_5329	HOLLOW MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH RULERS YARD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURERS AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
Line_5332	WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DISK AND WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT THE PERIMETER
Line_5333	I USED A YARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DES
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH THOSE AND I THINK THERE'S A STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT SIZED IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YOU'D STICK OR A RULER A THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVEN NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETER'S
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DEC DECIMETERS AND A METERS ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED A METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WE MEASURED THE COMPACITY OF A CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUPS
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE CAPACITY
Line_5346	WE USED A UM THE COMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU COULD POOR IT AND A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRADUATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLI MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PREMACH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPAC- CAPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP OR A WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	SE CUP THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLI LITERS
Line_5354	OW SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S YOUR IT'S HOW IT'S THE FOUL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSELS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND CAMPACITY
Line_5357	THAT A TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDER BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE CAPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER B
Line_5361	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUIDS A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH A WHAT THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE CAPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	HE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THE THIRTY THREE IT'S AT THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS DIFFERENT IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLUME AND THE CAPACITY THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS ARE DIFFERENT T
Line_5367	THE CAPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLUME
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF A CANS
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VEOLIUME OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LETTERS AND THE SMALLER ONE IS MILL LITERS
Line_5372	IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED SLANDER
Line_5373	IT'S LABELED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLI LITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD ADD UP THE M THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THAT'S
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINIT
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARM
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY HAVE UH UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINUTE
Line_5380	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT UP HIGH AND THEN IT GOES PRETTY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIERE AND HIERE AND HIER
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOW LEA M MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRASS AND IT GETS WARMER
Line_5382	I I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FROLLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	WARS IT WENT FROM TWENTY THE WEIGHT TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND LENGTHS AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COLD AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO AND THEN LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST TRASH IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
Line_5389	TO FIGAR OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM A LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRES HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL HERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINE SIDE UM THREES A LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND IT'S
Line_5396	UM NO WASH
Line_5397	E WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING THE COLLEGE SORT OF LIKE A HIGH WAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK IT DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM AH I WAIT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUIT A THINK I JUST
Line_5400	WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OR THE WIRES COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NO I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE THE NOTCHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF-
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS A CERTAIN TIPS OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	IS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONE BULB BUMPS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DO THE FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BULB ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE I FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	WA TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	Y YEAH SOME TIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	AND THE ROCKS THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICK WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON VIRLENS STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD SEE LIKE THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THE WOOD
Line_5419	IF THE DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UM IT CAN DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT SO'S A MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU S MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	Y YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	OH THAT THE N HELP JUST PINA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	OTHER MAGNETS BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER S SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CAR BORB IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS STICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO WELL
Line_5431	WELL UH THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS CON
Line_5434	WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WON'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO IT THINK IT JUST RIGHT
Line_5437	M MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH THE
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE ELECELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKES IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WILL NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START TO START RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT'LL START GOING
Line_5444	THE POWER IS LIKE IN YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T START WORKING
Line_5446	WELL THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM ON THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	ANT THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MINE'S PLACED AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WERE ON THE S PLACE SO IT'LL STEEL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IT
Line_5450	TODAY I MADE POSTERS PIECE POSTER S
Line_5451	THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPER AND THE MIDDLE AND THE MAGNET BELOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIPS AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS ON UN THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY AND THE IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONES
Line_5455	YES IT DIED BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
Line_5456	TO DAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PIECE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PIECE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND AWARE IS BAD TOO BUT PIECE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE POSTERS OUT FOR PIECE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS YOU THEN IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GOLD THROUGH SO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL OR THE ELEC- ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT ON A BATT THE BAT WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINE'S
Line_5465	OH SINCE IF CLICK DOWN THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL YE I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	S OR A B OR S D YEA
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BARE WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULB CA
Line_5469	AND A AND B AND AFTER YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE'VE BEEN MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OUR THE LAST THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE WE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPIN GET
Line_5473	A A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE UM A YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE WAIT ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE D CELL S
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIRGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DURING CLASS S
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENTS HAS PLACE TO GO
Line_5479	HA IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	H HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWS IN TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT ITS GOING OUT OF ITS NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENTS WOULD GOING UP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE LA UH NO IT'S THE FLOW TO THE LEAST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS EITHER BY DROPPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPPED THEM ON THE RIMS CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A DIRTY AMOUNT WEIGHT A
Line_5488	MA WEIGHT BREAKS THE MAGNETIC WAVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC QUAKE THE CALLED
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WAVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS IN BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNET AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURNS THE ELECTROMAGNET ON THIS
Line_5492	UM I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKES THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINDS IT HAS THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE POWERFUL ELECTROMAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKES IT THE ELECTRO MAGNET STRONGER
Line_5495	IT IT BUSTED EAST AND AND THE POLIVIT SPUN AROUND AND SO ELSE
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSED A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF THE LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARM LIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTORS RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ON IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON ENOFF
Line_5499	ENERGY IT CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTOR OR LIGHT RUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TO ON
Line_5501	H IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES TO AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULB
Line_5502	UM ONE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	UM IT MAKES IT SO UH THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	THE WIND ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT IN A CIRCLE
Line_5505	WE RUBBED A PA CLIP ON A MAGNET THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5507	UH IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CAN PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S S MAGNETIC
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL ALL TO A DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_5510	WITH A REGURMAGNET YOU CAN DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLD US BUT T YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVE IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES A LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK I I JUST DON'T THINK IT WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAG SICK
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK FAST TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THEN THE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSITE WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES S
Line_5519	ECAUSE IT'S TILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM I WOULD DO EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAID IT JUST SWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTOR A'S FLAT RUNS
Line_5522	INSTEAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT'LL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WEIGHT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCH THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WAIT TIL IT LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
Line_5525	WHY YOU WON'T DO IT LIKE ONE
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS OR WHAT THEY CALLED IT E
Line_5529	WEI WHAT'S CALLED THE POLE PARA
Line_5530	W WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	WE'LL DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	M I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND THE OTHER LIGHT BUBBLE CELL KEEPS WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN RACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT'S TO D NABLE HARD WEAR A SELARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIGHT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICED THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRIGHT
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERIES THEY A YOU COULDN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	YE CAN'T UNDERSTAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOOD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE AND ONE HAT I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULB'S BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHERS
Line_5548	I THINK IS SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNET
Line_5550	AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOX AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METAL TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS CUBE
Line_5552	AND UM UM I FOR
Line_5553	WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT EM SOMEWHERE IN THE CAR BOX AND WE TRIED TO FIND AT
Line_5554	UH WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPASS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX AND THEN WE CIRCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	TE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THERE IS A METAL OR A LIKE A ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHERS A MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TECNICALLY FINDS UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FINS METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WHERE'S MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUP
Line_5561	Y USING LIKE A NAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOX AND FIND IT TIL IT FEELS S
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY UH STICK TO CERTAIN KINDS
Line_5563	IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHERE LEVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NO IT DID NOT IT JUST KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLAIT
Line_5565	UH I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5566	THE THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LET THEN SIDE THE PENCIL
Line_5567	YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEIR GOT IS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT A STRONG
Line_5569	I I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUITE SURE
Line_5571	YOU THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MAH A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I SANK AND THE W
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UP SO IT UM TURNS ON IT TURNS OFF
Line_5575	IT IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UHM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO UH MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD TO UM PLAN AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UH UM WHAT YEAH
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHIRDCAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	E ENERCHIES UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	A CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	UH WE PUT IT UNDER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY OPINION I WOULD IT I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE A UM THIS LITTLE THING IN SIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THOSE LITTLE SAMBAUS AND WE SAW UM IN A KEE AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH LIKE THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB IN WALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE IS A LIGHT BULB THE IRONS AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY Y
Line_5591	UM THE DRUMS RELATE BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WHERE'S SCATTERED BUT IT GOES A WA OR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	UH IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY AND THIS SLOW AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TOO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE RIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HOOKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLEITS
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HUOKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE I ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL ON TO THE PLATE
Line_5602	UH WELL AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BE CAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICED THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT SIT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO THE OTHER ONE AND COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	HE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE THE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS THESE CIMBLES AND IT THEY'RE ON THIS S
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM I DO NOT QUITE
Line_5616	WE MADE A A MAGNET THAT CAN TURN OFF AND ON
Line_5617	UH WEIGH WHAT AN
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE UM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE TO RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAD TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAGNET THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET KIND OF SO WHEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I'M NOT YET QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S A SPECIAL METAL BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE IT
Line_5624	NO THEY WON'T E
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIED THAT WE NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	W E USE JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT I NOT SURE IF I'M CORRECTED JUST IN MY OPINION
Line_5629	WELL IF THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T GLOW
Line_5630	UM WE ALL SO JUST WIND I FORGET
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIED UM THE WIRE TOUCHING IT INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
Line_5632	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE ASK OR HELP FROM MIRMOCINI ANE TOLD US TO Y WRAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVET
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT UH THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UH ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE MAKE THE LIGHTS TURN
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FUMELEC OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM A THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGH MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOU WILL NEED MORE YOU'RE
Line_5641	NOT BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAYS BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	YES YOU CAN STILL MAKE A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGER THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT A TWO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE WRONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE IN
Line_5648	IN THE WRONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE THE
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY Y BE RUN THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE AND THE RIGHT PLACES FOR IT TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO H DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I IS YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY COULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WILNDA WALK TWO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BOLE UM THE
Line_5656	WELL THE STEEL WIRES SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5657	T IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THERM
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE A SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	UM SO THE SO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5662	UM YES IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	WE NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMILAR TO TH IS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OR ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHTBULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAINST
Line_5670	YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND T THEY BOTH WORKED WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	Y YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YES SCIENCE IS VERY SQUIL
Line_5674	U WE'RE SEEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	CHIPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THERE ARE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHERS GOING INTO A CUP S IT UNHOOKED THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEN HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UH HOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	S IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING DCHHACHED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY O BEEN DTRACTED AND M
Line_5682	YES THAT IT'S HAVING TO THE MAGNET'S
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PUT SH THE ONE WASHER THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATE THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE A WITH STICKER S
Line_5685	YES IT DOES TELLS US
Line_5686	USHERS IT TAKES TO TAKE THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHERS IT TAKES TO BREAK THE FOSS
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHERS THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO PICK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_5689	I I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM SHU THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT IT SPUN E
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM IN THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BACHERY A BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WELL Y YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DIDN'T SCIENCE WE'RE WE USED THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU WOULD PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BOTTLE UM CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
Line_5697	I I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT THAT WHATEVER IS IN HERE IS IS A LIGHT BULB I THINK
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A IT IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KINDA LIKE A SCRAP RIGHT NOW
Line_5700	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHT'S THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION AS HAPPENING
Line_5704	NO IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNETS
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND A PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL L
Line_5706	NEAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	T THE MAGNETS CAN GO WITH THREE THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT COULD GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_5709	UM WE BUILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEWHERE WE DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND A
Line_5710	WHEN THE MIDDLE SHAVINGS FROM THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STANDS UP
Line_5711	BE CAUSE MAGNETS ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF THEN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARDBOARD
Line_5713	UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIKER THAN THE THREES
Line_5714	CAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HERE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNET IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT IS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'D KNOW WERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNET'S THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE IN OF SWITCH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON AND OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE AN ENOUGH SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR IS NOT IN A RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR WALLS RUN
Line_5721	OR IF THE MOTOR'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE SO WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DO I DO I FORGOT
Line_5723	IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTNING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	YOU WOULD PUT BOTH WIRES AT THE BULB OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT HENCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCH UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE SIDES
Line_5728	UM YEAH BECAUSE WE TRIED THAT A COUPLE TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEIR CALLED
Line_5731	UH NOW ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	WELL THE WAY WE DID IT IS THAT A SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECTED UM CONNECTED SO THE ELECTRO MAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRIC
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET UM IT'LL GO THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	ELECTRICITY'S FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THE M
Line_5737	POWER IS GETTING TROUBLE THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS F FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	THE REASON IT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT RID TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MORNING IN SCIENCE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UPS ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO F FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASILY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT S MIX THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5748	INSULATION MEANS LIKE TO THE COPPER WIRE IS AND SIDE OF THE GREEN COATING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN A A SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS STAY MAGNETIC
Line_5751	THE LIGHT'S TURN OFF AND YES BUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULB'S TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME IT CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULBS AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I I OBSERVED WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CAN NOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUITS
Line_5757	NO I WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNING BYE ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Line_5759	THAT SOME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON THE CENTER SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LET'S GO PART
Line_5760	THE MAGNETS IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WILL UM THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN IT
Line_5762	WEAK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	M THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL ON THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM NOW IS ALUMINUM ALUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPELLING THE OTHERS
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FACING A PART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNETS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	I SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET THE THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THE NINETEEN WASHERS BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANY MORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROBABLY SEPARATE A QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACERS AND BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKES LITTLE FORCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE PULL THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACERS TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU'LL GET A HI ER NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS IN YOU'LL GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNETS WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANY MORE
Line_5776	WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIALS AND DOWN JUST SET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND BE CREATE RE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY D TURNS ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THESE ARE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	M I FORGET IT'S NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN ES AND IT USES SIMBLES TO TELL UM INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE DETAILS
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	THIS SHOWS YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTORS CAN RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NINE WIRES
Line_5785	Y YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TODAY WE GET THIS FUN MISTER THING WITH WU FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	NO WIRES CONNECTED TO B
Line_5788	HI MY NAME IS JONAH
Line_5789	HI MY NAME IS JONA WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS
Line_5790	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM IN SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORKS
Line_5791	WELL THE WIRES ARE TOUCHED ABOUT ON A AND THE AND THE ONE ON D
Line_5792	WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECTS KEEPS THE CIRCUIT IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
Line_5793	WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRADS THAT THE WIRE'S ATTACHED TO OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
Line_5794	WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORK
Line_5795	U THE CONDUCTORS
Line_5796	WELL GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UH WORK
Line_5797	WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTACHED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MYSTERY BOARD BY WIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
Line_5798	WELL THAT SO THAT ON THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MISTORYBORD ARE CONNECTED FROM A TO S
Line_5799	WHILE A CIRCUIT IS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S UM MAKING SOMETHING WORKS
Line_5800	UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU JUST ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
Line_5801	UM THE BAT UM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5802	UM WELL JUST M MORE WA ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIKE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5803	I UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5804	I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
Line_5805	UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLA D BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINUS SIDE ON THE BATTERY
Line_5806	WELL WELL IT'S ALWAYS COMING IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE INTO THE INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE
Line_5807	WELL IT ALWAYS COMES IN THROUGH THE PLA SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE E
Line_5808	IT UM IT ALWAYS FLOWS OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND ALWAYS COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
Line_5809	WELL IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY THRUM AND THE PLA SIDE SO YEAH
Line_5810	WELL IF THE B CUP IF IT'S TOO HEAVY ON THE B CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THAT IT'LL BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
Line_5811	S IF WE HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER AND OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
Line_5812	WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FORCES PERRY STRONG
Line_5813	WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAK THE FORCE
Line_5814	THEY'RE GETTING SPREAD APART
Line_5815	THE DISTANCE INCREASES
Line_5816	THE MAGNETIC FORCE SLOWLY WEAKENS UNTIL L IT'S NOT MAGNETIC UNTIL IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5817	WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO SPACERS AT YOUR MATE
Line_5818	GROUP A GOOP B GOOP D THEY ALL ARE PREY MUCH THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT GROUP C JUST GOING TO THROUGH THEIR WASHERS IN AND BAD ORDER
Line_5819	WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
Line_5820	UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING UH THIS CIRCUIT IS ONE BATTERY AND IT'S POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT ONCE
Line_5821	WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5822	AND HUH YEAH
Line_5823	WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAS ONE
Line_5824	EACH EACH UHM LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_5825	YEAH EACH UM PONENT HAS THEIR OWN PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE OUR THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5826	WELL THE BULB A AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5827	WELL UH THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5828	WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5829	TWO PASTWAYS- I THINK
Line_5830	THIS REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5831	IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5832	THAT UM THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE POWER
Line_5833	WELL THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
Line_5834	M YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S PROBABLY A MAGNET IN IT
Line_5835	WELL E MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAY IT'S GOING
Line_5836	WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISM IS UHM LIKE WHAT THE FILINGS ARE GETTING PULLED TO
Line_5837	T I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM CORNER
Line_5838	HE PAPER CLIP FLIES TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUSHING IT PUTTING IT IN
Line_5839	UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND TO BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
Line_5840	WELL WHEN YOU GET CLOSER TO THE MAGNET IT'LL START POINTING REAL HARD AND THEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING AT IT SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MAGNET
Line_5841	WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
Line_5842	WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP AROUND THE CORE THE UM THE STRONGER THE ELECT THE UM MAGNET WILL BE
Line_5843	M I DON'T KNOW
Line_5844	THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE F FLOWING THROUGH IT
Line_5845	WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AN IRON COLOR IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP LIKE WASHERS
Line_5846	UM WELL UH NOT SURE
Line_5847	THE UHM CORN WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE WASHERS
Line_5848	WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THEN ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
Line_5849	WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW SO THE THE CIRCUIT THAT THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK
Line_5850	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT WILL PICK UP ALL WASHERS
Line_5851	IF THE UM UH SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
Line_5852	A THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET WORKS
Line_5853	WELL THE CORD MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO PULL THE WASHERS AWAY
Line_5854	THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED ABOUT T IT AND IT IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
Line_5855	UM I'M NOT SURE
Line_5856	WELL WE HAD A LAYER A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE A AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
Line_5857	WELL YOU HAVE TO USE THE UM THE D CELL TO GET THE UM ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5858	IT PRETY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO YOU CAN SPIN AROUND CIRCUIT
Line_5859	I THINK THE REASON IT UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOURCE CHOUSED ATTA L LIGHT BULB
Line_5860	WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GIVE IT THEY THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GUIDES IT THROUGH
Line_5861	WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULB LIGHT
Line_5862	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_5863	LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_5864	MEASURE WHAT CONTACT POINTS ARE
Line_5865	UM YOU CONNECTED HIM TO EACH CONTRACTS FROM IT AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
Line_5866	WELL UHM WELL UHM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THE SIDE
Line_5867	UM UM NOT SOR
Line_5868	WELL A D CELL GIVES THE UM A GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
Line_5869	VE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
Line_5870	BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING HER SO IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
Line_5871	UM THE CIRCUIT UM UH IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STARTS O UP AGAIN
Line_5872	WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PARK WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A FLAG SO THE FLAG IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_5873	THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SIT AROUND
Line_5874	IT'S MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_5875	UM IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GOING IT
Line_5876	LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING ATTACH THE CONTACT POINTS SO IT'S GETTING LIT
Line_5877	M THERE'S A MOTOR AT THE BOTTOM
Line_5878	IT HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THE CORE
Line_5879	WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE QUARYMORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BAD REASON
Line_5880	UM IT SHOWING THAT IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED WINES IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5881	ONE HUNDRED MIN WA WINDS MEANS THAT I'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
Line_5882	WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
Line_5883	UM IF YOU IF IT'S NOT S WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
Line_5884	THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5885	WELL THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AROUND THE CAR AN MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
Line_5886	WELL THE UM THE MORE WINDS YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT WILL PICK UP
Line_5887	WELL ONE WEIGHT OF STRENGTH IN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINDS AROUND THE MORE TIMES
Line_5888	UH YOU COULD WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES
Line_5889	UM SOME OF THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY
Line_5890	UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST IN KEEPS INCREASING AND THE MORE WASHERS YOU UM I MEAN THE MORE WINE YOU PUT
Line_5891	BECAUSE THE MORE IT'S TOUCH MORE TO COST ELECTRICITY ES IT BIGGER THE A ELECT THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS
Line_5892	IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD TIGER
Line_5893	WELL UM THE MORE UM WIRE WRAPS YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THE MORE UM WASHERS
Line_5894	WELL IT'S YONING AH LIKE BE MORE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
Line_5895	WELL THE MORE WRAPS ALL YOU DO THE HIRES THE RA GET UM BECAUSE THAT'S O WE'RE THE WASHERS
Line_5896	UM THE FARTHER YOU RIGHT IT INCREASES TEN WRAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIGHER
Line_5897	WELL WHEN THE NUMBER WRAPS GETS LARGER THE THE DATA THE WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP
Line_5898	THERE'S UH INCREASING UM HOW MUCH YOU D UM PICK UP
Line_5899	WELL THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU YET THE MORE WASHERS WASHERS SO PICK UP
Line_5900	WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THE WHEN IT'S NOT AS STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
Line_5901	IT MEANS IT STRONGER
Line_5902	BECAUSE UH NINETY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE THOSE FIFTEEN RAMP S
Line_5903	WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCTORS IT IS
Line_5904	AND IT OPENS WHAT AN A A OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_5905	WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKES IT SPIN
Line_5906	MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5907	WELL IF YOU HAVE AN INSULITER THE MOTOR'S NOT GOING TO WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONDUCTOR THE UM MOTOR WILL RUN

Line_5940	WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL IN THE CIRCUIT THE THEN
Line_5941	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER
Line_5942	THE BULBS LIGHT UP RIVER SO IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL YOU GET MORE LIGHT
Line_5943	WELL WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE D CELL THE D
Line_5944	WELL PLUS IS AGAINST PLUS AND MINUS ITS POINTING OUT
Line_5945	WELL WHEN YOU HAD MORE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
Line_5946	TH THE ENERGY FLOWS ABOUT TWO TIMES FASTER
Line_5947	THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5948	THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
Line_5949	WELL IN THIS SCIMATIC THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5950	THE PARALLEL VERTICAL LINES UH REPRESENT BATTERIES
Line_5951	UH ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COAL
Line_5952	IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
Line_5953	WELL AND THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO BRAKE THE POLE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5954	WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC POLE BECOMES A WEAKER
Line_5955	WELL THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT
Line_5956	NEXT T TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE
Line_5957	GOOD HOW M HOW ARE YOU
Line_5958	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY

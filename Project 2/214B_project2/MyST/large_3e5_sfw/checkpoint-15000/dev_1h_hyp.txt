Line_0	I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_1	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND CANNETIC ENERGIYES
Line_2	THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
Line_3	A SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DIVICE OR LIGHT BULBS SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
Line_4	THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
Line_5	I I I THINK I NEVER MIN
Line_6	IT'S A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE UM LIGHT BULBLIGH
Line_7	CANNETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_8	LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
Line_9	I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THE
Line_10	JONNEGRIIVITL SIDE
Line_11	I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_12	BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
Line_13	I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COL
Line_14	ARY OSOMBNIS
Line_15	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW WILL THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
Line_16	HITS THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
Line_17	BECAUSE IT DOES NOT A FALL COMPLEETE CIRCUIT
Line_18	THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FASING THE SUN
Line_19	MEANS THIS THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY OBSORBING IT MAKING GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
Line_20	THE IS A IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTO
Line_21	THE SOLAR CELL WOULD NOT OBSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUM AND IT WOULD STOP
Line_22	IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUNS TO THI SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
Line_23	I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
Line_24	WHAT IS HAPPINING IS IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY
Line_25	WE METAL OR A COPPER OR STEEL
Line_26	THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH AND ALL THAT PUNKY STUFF
Line_27	THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_28	THE RLR IS NOT RUYTING BECAUSE THE PATHE PUTS LOW WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
Line_29	IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT WE JUST ESTABLISHED THAT
Line_30	MADE OF MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT IS METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE
Line_31	DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE INMADE OF METAL
Line_32	THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN NOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_33	LITORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL ML
Line_34	THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
Line_35	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONCONNECTIONS AND HOW
Line_36	BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW OFF SO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND THAT SOME OTHER THING
Line_37	OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAXIS MIL
Line_38	A WIT WHICH IS THA THING MAKES IT LIGHT
Line_39	IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANY THING
Line_40	IS BURNING AND FLAMING AND
Line_41	USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WIGHN GOING ON A HATRACT BUT SHE IS ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
Line_42	OUND JUST PRODUCING OFF GIVING ET ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS ENERGY
Line_43	CAN HEARE SOUND BECAUSE ALL THAT OTHERSOOD
Line_44	THETE ALL WAYS WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANYWAY
Line_45	WILL BEURN TO FIRE
Line_46	BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS A SOLAR POWER CA
Line_47	IT WILL COME PUT THE SUN TO THE SOLLT POWDOR TO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THAT TRANSFERING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TRO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
Line_48	O CAY TON WE SCKIP THIS
Line_49	NONE REUSE THE BLOWE
Line_50	I IS ONLY THE ONETIME USEAND COAL IS JUST AND COALE IT IT CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BT LONG TIME
Line_51	THERY WILL NOT SCIING YAI I AM NOT
Line_52	THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_53	CIRCUITS AND H WELL CICUIT
Line_54	IL THINK THAT M BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
Line_55	I NOTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS A FLOCUT YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
Line_56	NOTICE THAT IT IS GOING THROUGHE AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY RAD IT CON'T
Line_57	THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY ONE D CELL AND THAT IS VERY COMPLECATED TO ME
Line_58	I NOTICE THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN A VERY RATICAL WAY
Line_59	WRIGHTER OR BE ER TO COMPLCATE IT
Line_60	THAT'S I DO NOT NOW ALEVER
Line_61	THEY ARE FLOWING IN A CIRCUIT AND THEY ARE ENERGY
Line_62	IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SID
Line_63	NOTICE THAT THEN D IS FLOWING AIN IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
Line_64	ELKAY I DON'T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN
Line_65	IT IS THE CAT CLOCK
Line_66	THEU NO ASN
Line_67	NO
Line_68	BECAUSE THEY DO
Line_69	I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_70	BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
Line_71	SUPERCONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
Line_72	UH I DON'T NO
Line_73	SORRY AND BISY AND IE DON'T WERLLY HAVE TIES WITH I THA
Line_74	I'M SORT OF BISY REALLY BISY YE
Line_75	THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE LIST I SA
Line_76	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMIANIMAL WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_77	WELL ONE IS OLUMINIM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END

Line_135	A THING
Line_136	I'M GOOD TO DAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITPORTS AND HOW THEY WORK
Line_137	THEY'RE WIRES AND THEY TROT THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_138	THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UMTO LIGHT THE BATTERY DIDN'T KNOW TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_139	MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_140	A D CELL BMATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY AND A CIRCUIT BUL
Line_141	THEYT TRANSFORED THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO A LIGHT BULB
Line_142	WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT
Line_143	IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMES INTO LIGHT ENR
Line_144	ELECTRICITY FLOWES IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICIITY FLOWES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
Line_145	ELECTRICITY IT'S GETTING SUCK BY THE PO
Line_146	ITHE ENERGY TWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_147	THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITYS FLOWING
Line_148	THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BOTH WEIGHED EVEN THOUG THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCHED
Line_149	I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
Line_150	THAT THE TWO WIRES HAV TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASING AND THE BULB CAT
Line_151	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES
Line_152	GYTHE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_153	THE MOTOR
Line_154	WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED FROM SORD ENERGY TO CONNETIC ENERGY
Line_155	THERE COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
Line_156	THE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
Line_157	THIS IS A CIRCUIT BORD
Line_158	THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_159	BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH
Line_160	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
Line_161	THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_162	THEY COLLECT ENERGYS SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
Line_163	THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FASING THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
Line_164	IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SOI SHILLS COLLECT
Line_165	ITWHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
Line_166	THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SOUN THE MOTOR WON'T A
Line_167	WHEN THERE IS NO SUN THERE IT ISWHEN THERE I NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_168	THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
Line_169	THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT THE
Line_170	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THINGS
Line_171	A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING

Line_220	THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRES
Line_221	COURSE THERE IS TWO BATTERIEEDS
Line_222	I 'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
Line_223	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE IT POALES
Line_224	THEY WOULD REPELL EACH OTHER

Line_262	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTOR
Line_263	THEY ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT A D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRE
Line_264	IS  HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER
Line_265	IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THERE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY
Line_266	THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_267	THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
Line_268	WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
Line_269	WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
Line_270	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFOR  AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
Line_271	LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
Line_272	THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THAT ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILLMENT AND THEYR GETS SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
Line_273	MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_274	SO THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_275	THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_276	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_277	RSENT THE ELECTRARUMS FLOWING THROUGH
Line_278	ON THE D CELL I NOTICED THE ELECTRUNS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
Line_279	WELL WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULBWILES STILL LIGHT
Line_280	WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
Line_281	THING THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT PLINTS WOULD NOT YET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN ITOF
Line_282	THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
Line_283	INDS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
Line_284	D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
Line_285	THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT USO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IS HAPPONING
Line_286	MOTOR TO RUN THAT THE D CELL BATTERY MUST TRANSFER ELECTRICITY
Line_287	THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_288	WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT PWEENT
Line_289	ATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
Line_290	IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUITS OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
Line_291	STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_292	ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BCAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
Line_293	OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CANT FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
Line_294	YOU HAVETO CLOSE THE SWITCH
Line_295	IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
Line_296	WE SOLAR SCELL IS TAKING THES SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_297	ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_298	THE SUNLIGHT IS HITTING THE SULAR SELL
Line_299	THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
Line_300	ND MOTOR STOPS RUNING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENERGY FOR AFOR TO RUN
Line_301	THE MOTOR STARTS STRONG CAUS NOW THERE IS ENERGY
Line_302	WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
Line_303	MIXTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_304	WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
Line_305	WELL THE CIRCUITS OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SUME AR CONDUCTORS SUME AR INSULATE
Line_306	ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_307	WELL UM IF YOU PUT AN INSULATORUM
Line_308	IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THE POPSICAL STIT DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_309	SULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
Line_310	INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE A UL LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
Line_311	THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_312	TOR STOPS RUNNING

Line_319	IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF SHEAET AND MAKING LIGHT
Line_320	THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A BUMER SOME CAN ANOISE THAT THAT SEYS ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_321	YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE DRUM TO MAKE IT RELIEACE A SOUND
Line_322	WHILLE THE PERSONS BURNING CALORIYE IS WALKING UP A MOUNTAN
Line_323	WOOD GASS FOED AND CANDLE
Line_324	IT 'LL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOL AR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND THEN EVEN WATER
Line_325	LEA IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
Line_326	IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENT LEASE FROM
Line_327	THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
Line_328	I AM NOT SURE
Line_329	THEY'RE BOTH EMVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLE AND THEY BOTH NEED OUT DOR THINGS
Line_330	THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MASS UP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CRILLY SMLG
Line_331	THEY POLLUTE THE ERTH WHILE SOLAOR PANELS DO NOT POLLEATE THE ERTH
Line_332	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_333	A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLO
Line_334	WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_335	WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_336	WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND A CIRCUIT
Line_337	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONMENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERIY
Line_338	THOSE ARE THE ELECTRUNS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_339	WELL THE THE BLUE DUS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_340	THE LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ANMU THERE 'S NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
Line_341	THE LIGHT WILL GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE POWER TO WUT THE ENERGY SLOW
Line_342	BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
Line_343	MAKING THE D CELL FACE THE THE SAME POLITARY
Line_344	YOU PUT THE D CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSIT
Line_345	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_346	WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT TWO WAIGS AND THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEM FLOWS IN TWO WAIGHS INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_347	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_348	THERE IS ONE D CELL AND THE TWO BULB
Line_349	THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT'S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED AND THE SAME CIRCUIT
Line_350	THE BULBS WILL GET BRIGHTER
Line_351	IT WOULD MAKE THE BULBS RIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
Line_352	THE BATN THEN THE YEALL ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY IN AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
Line_353	THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
Line_354	EACH BULB HAS IT'S OWN PATHWAY
Line_355	IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
Line_356	THERE IS TWO POWER SOURCES
Line_357	THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
Line_358	BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
Line_359	IT'S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE I'S AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_360	NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_361	THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE THE S
Line_362	THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT IF THE'RE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_363	THE OTHER BULB BURRANS
Line_364	THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TWO BECAUSE ONE OF UM THE FILLMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
Line_365	ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
Line_366	A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
Line_367	ONE FILLAMENT IS BURNTED OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TWO
Line_368	A FILMENT BRAKES AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
Line_369	WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWT STOPS
Line_370	THE BE FILLMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FROM ENERGY TO FLOW
Line_371	JUST PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORK BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS
Line_372	IT'S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT'S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN ESILY REPLACE IT
Line_373	THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHAR AND AND IT STAES OFFOFN
Line_374	THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNED WHICH IS LIKE AN OPENSE
Line_375	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IN THE PATHWAYS
Line_376	WELL UM
Line_377	FILLMENT BROKE SO UMSO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TO IF IT'S AA SERIES
Line_378	THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNED OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
Line_379	BECAUSE THE FILLMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRPLACUIT LIKE AN OPEN SWIT
Line_380	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_381	YOU LEARN HOW MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
Line_382	IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_383	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT'S ITHER STEEL OR IRON
Line_384	BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
Line_385	IT'S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_386	THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNETS AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
Line_387	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_388	OKA SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT ORAND AND IT'S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO ITLL NOT STICK
Line_389	ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DOS
Line_390	IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT IT IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOS
Line_391	IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
Line_392	YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_393	IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_394	IT STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT'S MADE OUT O STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
Line_395	LIGHING CETS ATTRACTED BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_396	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ONE TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS IN A WRACK
Line_397	THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE ATTRACTING
Line_398	THEY WILL REPELL EACH OTHER BECAUSE OIT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
Line_399	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
Line_400	BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME THE BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
Line_401	IT'S A COMPESS SHOWING NORTH ON THE ERTH
Line_402	SOME ONE USING A COMPRASS TO FG WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
Line_403	IT FOLLOWS THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTAD METAL THAT IS STDEEP INSIDE THE ERTH
Line_404	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRO
Line_405	BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPPST POLES ATTRACT
Line_406	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
Line_407	THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
Line_408	NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S TWO THICK
Line_409	WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THROUGH THE NAIL
Line_410	THE MAGPERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
Line_411	IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
Line_412	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCSE
Line_413	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERING THEREAN MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
Line_414	THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
Line_415	WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OFF IT D MAGNETIZE EVERYTHING ATS A TEMPORRARY MAGNET
Line_416	BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
Line_417	MAGNETISM TRANSFERS BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_418	THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPERCLIP
Line_419	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BRAKING WITH WEIT
Line_420	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE THIN STAFF
Line_421	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FORS BECAUSE IT IS TO THICK
Line_422	SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BRAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIT
Line_423	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AWA
Line_424	WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKENS THE MAGNETIC
Line_425	WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACE IRS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCSE FROM ATTRACTING
Line_426	IT IT MAKES THE FORE WEA
Line_427	THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANC
Line_428	WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACE
Line_429	IT MAKES IT TAKE LESS WASHERS TO BREAKE THE FORCE OF MAGNET
Line_430	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ELECTRO MAGNETS
Line_431	YOU WRAP THE CORD WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORD
Line_432	IT MAGNETISEES THE COLE
Line_433	WASHERS ARE GETING COT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_434	WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAIN EGE BECAUSE ELECTRO MAGNETS USE A TUN OF ENERGY
Line_435	I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE BAT THE ENERGY AND THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
Line_436	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIEL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
Line_437	MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON'T LAST FOREVER
Line_438	IT MAGNETIZES THE COARL
Line_439	IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE COIEL TO MAGNETISE IT
Line_440	THE THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THAT COILE TO MAGNETISE THE RIV
Line_441	TO BE MADE FROM STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Line_442	HAVE TO BE WRAPED AWOUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETISE THE THE RIVE
Line_443	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_444	UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND TA D CELL BATTERY
Line_445	THIS THESE ARE WIEIS
Line_446	THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB HEIGHT
Line_447	THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
Line_448	IT IS THE SORD
Line_449	IT PROVIDES ENERTY TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_450	IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_451	I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
Line_452	CONNEXT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
Line_453	THE WIRES ARE A PATHERY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_454	I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELES IN WIRE
Line_455	THERE IS CARRYING ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT
Line_456	THEY LIGHT THE USE ELECTRICITY
Line_457	RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES FLOWR BULB LIGHT
Line_458	ITHIS
Line_459	THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWES AND IT GOES INTO A LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
Line_460	TIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SID
Line_461	IT'S THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUM ON IT
Line_462	THE LECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE A CLOSIN TO THE D CELL
Line_463	THEY RE PRESENT ELECTRICITY
Line_464	THE ELECTRICITY IS FORMED I THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_465	THE ELECTRITHE FLO GOES THE OTHER WAY
Line_466	UH JUST THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOUS
Line_467	TRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE UK THE D CELL
Line_468	THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
Line_469	WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LURNNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
Line_470	THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_471	I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
Line_472	IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
Line_473	THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_474	THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY END IT SPIN
Line_475	THE MOTOR USES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_476	THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_477	I DON'T KNOW
Line_478	SWITCH IN THIS PIXTURE IS UP AND
Line_479	THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_480	IT MEANS THAT 'S THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOW IN
Line_481	I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR SET'S RUNNING
Line_482	I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE IT IS A CLOSE CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
Line_483	THE ELECTRICAL LOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
Line_484	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR ATS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
Line_485	THE SWITCH IS DOWN
Line_486	THE THE A CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_487	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THAT MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
Line_488	I THINK THAT THE VY THING IE NE
Line_489	I THINK THE SOLI CELL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON THE CLOUDY DAY
Line_490	UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I TRICK ON IT AGAN
Line_491	WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR STOP THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
Line_492	A SOLAR SALT DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RU
Line_493	I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
Line_494	THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
Line_495	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_496	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAD PANEL
Line_497	THE MOTOR IS STITTING
Line_498	THE NAIL
Line_499	THE MOTOR KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPER CLIP BRIDGES THE OPEN SWITCH
Line_500	I THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
Line_501	THE POPSICAL STICK IS THERE AND IT'S NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
Line_502	INSULATORS CAN NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL MADE OF METAL
Line_503	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
Line_504	THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DONOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
Line_505	OND MILTCHEE
Line_506	THE MOTOR STOPS
Line_507	I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSE I SAY IT IS OPEN
Line_508	IT IS A CLOSED
Line_509	CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
Line_510	THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
Line_511	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_512	UM WE BEEN UNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
Line_513	THINK THAT UM THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
Line_514	I SEE THAT THE MAX THE WAX IS MELTED
Line_515	I SEE THAT THE WAXIS MELL
Line_516	I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELT
Line_517	UIS SEE A FLAME
Line_518	IT IS MELTING THE WAX
Line_519	U SOME ONE IS DRAMING
Line_520	SHE IS EATING AND WALKING
Line_521	I CAN HEARE T AND YE
Line_522	I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WAK
Line_523	THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE IS SHE HAS ENERGY TO WA
Line_524	I THINK THAT STUFF MEE
Line_525	IR GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
Line_526	THEA AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
Line_527	OCAY
Line_528	UM THE SOLAR SOALTICLES THE CHERBY NOVE
Line_529	STUFF
Line_530	THEY ARE BOTH NOT RENEWABLE
Line_531	I THINK THAT THE THE AR WILL BE POLLUTED
Line_532	UM THE COALAND GASPILLY LETS THE AIR
Line_533	UM COLAN GASS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_534	I DON'T KNOW
Line_535	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_536	WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_537	THE ELECTRICITY IS LOWING AND IT IS CLOS
Line_538	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN' STOP
Line_539	ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND A STR CAN
Line_540	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULT
Line_541	E ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D CELL AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_542	E BLUE DOT THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY THIT'S HOW THE ELECTRICITY
Line_543	THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERY WAY DUUM
Line_544	ONE
Line_545	THINK I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WE'LL NEAND MORE WIRES
Line_546	I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHT TO
Line_547	THE LIGHTS GOT RIGHT
Line_548	N THE THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GIVE THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHTS
Line_549	I SEE THAT
Line_550	THE Y H YOU ARE THE BEAUTIFUL MIST LADY IN THE WRL
Line_551	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_552	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_553	THE THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
Line_554	T ARE TO
Line_555	I THINK THAT THE BULBS WELL WE BI
Line_556	IS GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY THROUGH THE  HOW COULD  PUT THE POSITIVE MOUNT THROUGH
Line_557	THAT IS VALARY CRECTS
Line_558	I NOTICE THAT IT GOES AND THROUGH THE POS THEY RUN OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE THES UGGLY A SWMEN
Line_559	THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_560	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO PATH WAY
Line_561	IT BURNS OUT THAT VERY QUILE
Line_562	NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_563	THEY ARE BRI T
Line_564	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO TO RACTUALLA ONLY GOES LYING BY  BU
Line_565	THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
Line_566	I THINK THE TOP RIGHT
Line_567	THE TOP RITE
Line_568	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_569	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_570	ITTHEY THERE ARE CHI LIGHTS IN THEM
Line_571	THERE IS ONE BULL THERE IS ONE D CELL AN TWO BUL
Line_572	EACH LIGHT BULB HAS IT'S ORM PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAY
Line_573	THEY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CATH WEAY
Line_574	UN THEY ARE  THE'RE UN POWND PIFTY
Line_575	THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DAMA
Line_576	I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGT
Line_577	PARALLEL CIRCUITS OUR DRIDE TR YOU ARE THE DEA T SW
Line_578	UM THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY A SALT
Line_579	THEY R LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_580	IT IS FLOW IN
Line_581	THE FLOW IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE N
Line_582	THE IT IS GOING AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE MAGNET
Line_583	I TOLD YOU IT GOS OUT THEY WE'RE THEN
Line_584	I DO NOT ASHURE YOU SO PRITTY YOU SAY IT'S AGAIN
Line_585	THERE ARE TWO HOLE HALF THE WEIGHT S AND THEY ARE GON
Line_586	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS AND A PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Line_587	IT LASSTS LONG
Line_588	ER UH TWO BATTERIES
Line_589	THE ONE ON THE BOTTOME LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICK LY
Line_590	UH THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOME US
Line_591	BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHAIR THE FAT EN
Line_592	THEY HAVE TO SHAR A PATHWAY AND A D CEL
Line_593	THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND BOTH OF THEM
Line_594	THINK THAT WE NEED A MIXTURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT SO WE NEAED THE POWRALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_595	THE SERIES A SOURCUIT
Line_596	I AM GOHODED HOW ARE YOU MY BOUTYEED
Line_597	I'V FOUNDD OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
Line_598	AND A CX THINGS OBVIOUSLY BULTH MORE AN SA
Line_599	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE RAFIEGRAL WEIGHT TALL
Line_600	S THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
Line_601	THE NAIL THING IS STICKING ONTO THE MAGNET
Line_602	IT'S INDS MADE OF IMAYB NOT
Line_603	WOOD YEAON PLASTICK YEAH
Line_604	OBJECTS THAT ATTRACT TO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_605	THE WOOD BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL ON IT SO IT WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_606	THE WOOD BLOCK IS DOESN'T HAVE NY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOES NOT ATTRAPT
Line_607	THEY BUS ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL DON'T YOU THINK THAT
Line_608	JEOU THEY ARE BU MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_609	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_610	I TOLD YOU IN MAGNET STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
Line_611	THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OF IT STICKS
Line_612	ONE IS MADE OF IROND THAND ONE  STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
Line_613	STEEL WINE THE STEEL NAIL
Line_614	IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_615	I NOTICE THAT IT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
Line_616	IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
Line_617	IT STICKS
Line_618	I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO THE CAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_619	IT  IRON OR STEEL
Line_620	MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LAIRN TODAY
Line_621	I'M DOING FIN HOW ARE YOUOU
Line_622	LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COMPRSSES
Line_623	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
Line_624	I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
Line_625	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
Line_626	I THINK THAT IT BECAUSE M IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME SIZE AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
Line_627	WHEN IT'S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN IT'S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY APATE
Line_628	THE SAME SIDE ARE TOUCHING
Line_629	BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_630	IT IS A COMPAESS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND A SOUTH SAYM AON ERTH A NOIS FUL IN A SOUTH POLE
Line_631	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_632	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
Line_633	I DID NOT HEARE WHAT YOU JUST SAID
Line_634	I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEAS
Line_635	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_636	THEY ARE PRITTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY GOS STICK TOGETHER
Line_637	THE CAN NOT GOETHE WOE DON'T LET GO
Line_638	THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
Line_639	THE NAIL MAKES THE THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL NECK A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_640	I DON'T KNOW
Line_641	SI DON'T KNOW
Line_642	H IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_643	THE NAIL IS NOT MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_644	CAUSE BECAUSE IT IS N'T THE NAIL I MEAN IT IS N'T THE BATHNET ANYMORE
Line_645	I THINK THE BLOWE STUFF MEANTHAT IT HAS
Line_646	I DO NOT NO
Line_647	I'M DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_648	I'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_649	THE MAGNET IS MMOVING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
Line_650	BUT HIVE THERE ISN'T ENOUF CA R
Line_651	WHEN THERE IS LOTS OF WEIGHT ON BE SIDE THEN THE N MAKES P
Line_652	THER ARE WASHE NO THE'RE A MAGNET
Line_653	WASHERS GO INTO THE B CUP
Line_654	UMTHAT YOU CANN'T PUT THE SPACERS
Line_655	IT MOVES THE MAGNET FORC ME WEAKER
Line_656	IT WEAKENS THE FORIST
Line_657	I DO WL NOT NOW
Line_658	IT PUSH IN POSHA WA
Line_659	O PUT SPACE THE
Line_660	IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
Line_661	IT BECOMES LESS AND LE
Line_662	WILL IT MAKES THE THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETNIC FORCES WEAKER
Line_663	GOOD
Line_664	WEIVE AND SAEN HOW A LITTLE RRIVETS AND PICK UP WASHER
Line_665	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_666	THEY ARE SOME OBJECTS
Line_667	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_668	IT WIL S CLOWD OR NOT
Line_669	IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STFF
Line_670	IT DOES NOT HAVE THE WUGT'S SHOW FILL HERE
Line_671	IT'S BIDO NOWALECAY
Line_672	IT TURNS INTO A MAN
Line_673	IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTRO MAGNET AND YOU CAN PICK UP METAL
Line_674	THERE IS LALS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
Line_675	MOUTS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
Line_676	ELEC TRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVERT MAKE A MAGN AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_677	I CAN RAP I DON'T KNOW
Line_678	ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL THING AND OU COULDN'T PECKLSTOFP
Line_679	THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
Line_680	IT JUST ROLE IN THE STEEL ET
Line_681	IT IS CLOSED
Line_682	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CANT PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_683	I TOLD YOU A BILLY IN TIM
Line_684	WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN UTOM WASHERS ARE
Line_685	THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN'T
Line_686	YOU HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE A ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_687	THEY HAVE TO U
Line_688	THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
Line_689	BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED ABOUT THE RIVIT
Line_690	IT HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
Line_691	THEN IT CAN BE A MAGNET
Line_692	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETISM
Line_693	A BATTERY A LIGHT BULMB TWO WIRES
Line_694	THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROME TO HEAT UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHT
Line_695	THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECT CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU ARE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
Line_696	IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CANTHAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULBING BACK
Line_697	WITH OUT THE WIRES UM THEREWOULD BE NO CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD UM NOT LIGHT UF TO LIGHT BULB
Line_698	THAT IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_699	CARRY A ELECTRICITY FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTRY
Line_700	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE  WHAT YOU NEADE ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND ONE AND OP THE
Line_701	THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRIELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTTING TO IT
Line_702	IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WITH IT'S MOSLY JUST RECIVING IT TO LIGHT IT
Line_703	IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVERRALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
Line_704	THE LITTLE BLUE BULBS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING THE LIGHT VULVING GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BULBS AR BULBS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
Line_705	TO THE ITHE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO GO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
Line_706	IT HA THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTL NOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR A THAELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
Line_707	LIGHT   REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
Line_708	THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPES SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU DIST ATACH RON  THE WIRES
Line_709	I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WOULN'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ONE THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BA CERALS IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT
Line_710	THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND NO MATER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
Line_711	WE HAVEN'T DON ANYTHING NO BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND WITH THE FLOW OF ENERGY
Line_712	THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE ENERGY FROM THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGHT INTO THE BATTER
Line_713	THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY RAS THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW ON THEWAY
Line_714	IT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING USMENT AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOS I TO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WELL LEARN ABOUT YESTERD
Line_715	THIS IS A SWITCHIT
Line_716	THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WEIY AROUND IT TO THE BOT
Line_717	THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
Line_718	THEY COULD WORK THE SUNS ENERGY AND TENER ELECTRICITY THAT YOU COULD NE
Line_719	THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
Line_720	ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING THROUGH IT AND BACK
Line_721	NOT WORE IT WOULD NOT TERNTHIS THE SUNS IT
Line_722	MAYBE IF IT'S IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
Line_723	THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS SHOWING THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_724	THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
Line_725	TRYING TO GET A IT
Line_726	THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREWL
Line_727	HONE IS M A SCREW AND IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO FIX THE OPEN CIRCUIT
Line_728	THE PANT PAPER CLIP IS COMPLETING THIS CIRCUIT
Line_729	CTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPER CLIP
Line_730	THE CRAVE STICK IS MAKING DIFFERENT SO IT'S STILL OPEN
Line_731	THE CRAPPED STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT OBSORBS ALL IF IT
Line_732	IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL IT IS MADE OF PLASTICK AND PLASTICK IS AN INSULATOR OR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
Line_733	INSULATORS DO NOT LIKE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_734	IF THEY ARE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
Line_735	ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS WHAT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
Line_736	I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT STEL AN NOT COMPLETING
Line_737	THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
Line_738	A PARAL RAA PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_739	FOR ABELTA THE LIGHT BUMBS THEY HAVE TO SHAR ONE D CELL
Line_740	BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SHARING ONE BIG ONE
Line_741	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUIT CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_742	IT IS A IT'S A CLICOMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
Line_743	WE THE THE LIGHT BUBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
Line_744	IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLENCATED BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY BY GOING THA DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS
Line_745	ONE IS JUST GONNING T ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
Line_746	THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
Line_747	ADDING A BATTERY WOOD UM CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
Line_748	COMES FROM THE PCOMPRA AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE SIDE YOU WEIGT NO POSITIVE SID
Line_749	THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING OMR THE D CELL
Line_750	THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB ON ONE OF THEM BUT I CAN BULB ON THE OTHR
Line_751	THE LIGHT BULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEMSELVES THAT'S HARDALY BEEN USED
Line_752	THEY HAVE TO SHEAR A PATHWAY AND IT'S A LGH WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHT BUBS HAD ARDY HELP USE SOME THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
Line_753	I THINK A PARALLEL A VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS AND LIGHTING
Line_754	YO H GOOD
Line_755	THEY'RE THEY'RE NORMALLY USED AT CRISMESS TO DECORATE SMESS TREES AND HOUSES
Line_756	IT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
Line_757	THE WHOLE STRINGS BURNOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT ITS
Line_758	A PARALL A PARALLEL CIRCU
Line_759	CIRCUITS IF A BULMB DOS AT THE WHOLE LIKE DS THE WHOLE THING GOS HOUD ENUGH TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT THE ONE THAT'S BURNED OUT THAT'S NOT GOOD
Line_760	THE OTHER BULB THUNS OUT ALSO
Line_761	THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
Line_762	THE BULBWENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_763	THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL I BOTH COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_764	THEY GIVE EACH OTHER THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY NEED
Line_765	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY ISN'T EVEN
Line_766	THE THER BULBS SAY ARE IND THAT ONES STANDING WHEN THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHER S BURN I
Line_767	THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND HE'RE GOING IN ALL THE IGN AND IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST OF TEM ST LIGH
Line_768	THE FLOW STOPS AND THE FILLMEND IN THE FILLMET IN THE BULB WHITH THE FILLM HADS BROKEN
Line_769	ELLIMET IS BROKING ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND ON THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IT'S FIN
Line_770	IT'S BOTH A CIRCUIT WITH RNING BULBS BUT THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_771	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
Line_772	THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR CAUSTHE THINGS MADE OF IRON
Line_773	THE IRON IT'S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
Line_774	WOOD A YARN COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
Line_775	THE ONES THAT DON'T STICK TO MAGNETS DON'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_776	THE STEEL SCAR IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOOD BLOCK IS N'T EREMOVE
Line_777	AND STEEL ONLY IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THE
Line_778	IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BUOCK HAS
Line_779	THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON AND THE WOOD BLUCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR EVEN STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN'T STICK
Line_780	IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULS IT TO THE MAGNET
Line_781	ONE IS MADE OF TEN AND THE OTHER ONES MADE OF STEEL
Line_782	ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_783	IT WILL STICK CAUSE IT HAS TRACES OF ELECTIRON
Line_784	THE HUOD BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK MT THE BLACK RO
Line_785	IT WEALL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF IRON OR A STEEL STEEL PAPER CLIP
Line_786	THERE'S IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON TUST RE INFORICSE
Line_787	ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT
Line_788	THEY WOULD SAPPATRACTING AND THEY WOULD REAP
Line_789	THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PLUSH IT IT'S BECAUSE IT QUICKRS THE OTHER MAGNET S I JUST WON'T GO TOGETHER
Line_790	BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OVOSLITS ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES RIPL
Line_791	UMING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
Line_792	SHE 'S USING COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE 'S GOING T RIGHT NOW SHE'S GOING NORTH
Line_793	IT ATTRACTS TO THE ERTH NORTH POLE
Line_794	WE'E BEEN LEARNING WHAT STEEKS PRVIINETS IND WHAT HAPANS WHEN THEY INTER RACT
Line_795	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_796	THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRYENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECT
Line_797	MAGNET ISM ONLY HAS A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT'S BEOND THE RANGE THEN THEY WON'T STICK
Line_798	IT'S TWO IT'S TWO FAR
Line_799	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO BIG STEEL SCREW AND IT'S ALSO GIVING IT THE MAGNETISM BUT IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_800	SO IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETIM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW WEN IT ATTRACTS THE PAPER CLIP
Line_801	THEY ARE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONESE
Line_802	IT'S SYNA IT'S ATTRACTED
Line_803	THE MAGNETISUM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHEN IT COMES OFF IT THEN NAIL STOPS BEING A MAGNET
Line_804	WHEN YOU OU WHEN YOU DRINK THE THE MAGNET POFFIT STOPS DORING A MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIP ALSO BECOMES THE MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
Line_805	IT'S TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_806	IT'S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP WITH IT'S MAGNETISM
Line_807	TAKE THE YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
Line_808	BCAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZSED THE WHOLE TIME
Line_809	EA MAGNETISM
Line_810	IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON SOLECT STEEL OBJECTS
Line_811	MAGNETS AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE
Line_812	EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
Line_813	THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT THE MAGNETSCAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH SUCH STICK THAT  STACK
Line_814	DEELING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
Line_815	A BAG NIT
Line_816	UHTHERE IS ONLY A CERTAN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNET ISM BRAKES BECASE IT IT'S TO STRONG O THE WEAIT ON THE OTHER
Line_817	THEY ID ANOTHER ONE
Line_818	MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THE MAGNETISM ONS WEAKER LEED THROUGH THAT THROUGH THOST SPACERS
Line_819	IT MUCH WEAKER AND THEY LIGHTS GOT
Line_820	THE BARCLTES SAW MAGNET TOIZIELAM BO
Line_821	I GOOD NO TIS UM
Line_822	MAYAXITS WEAKER BECAUSE THEY'RE FARTHER WEA
Line_823	BULLES
Line_824	ADD MORE SPACERS
Line_825	DCREASES IT
Line_826	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC PULLEWEAKER
Line_827	IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKES
Line_828	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_829	IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETISE THE SCREW SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
Line_830	THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT IT STOPS REAING ELECTRIELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM T  DISAPPEARES
Line_831	MISSA D CELL STEEL WASHERS UH SWITCH IS A RIVET AWIRES UH THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT WORD
Line_832	IT MAKES A STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
Line_833	IT'S MAGNETIZING THE THE THE STEEL WASHERS
Line_834	IT LETS THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE MIDDAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND THE MORE YOU RAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER THA OU MAGNET ISM GET
Line_835	THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE COVERING A MOTOR IS ONLY IT HAS TO BE FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
Line_836	THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND CIRCLES TIL IT GETS WEAK AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
Line_837	IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORRARY MAGNET
Line_838	IF THE SWITCH ESILLY CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CANT FLOW IT CANT BECOME A MAGNET
Line_839	A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED MAYBE IT MAGNEFIEDE
Line_840	SWITCH CONTROALS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
Line_841	IT'S MAGNETID UP TO THITHE RIVET
Line_842	AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURNING ON AND OFF
Line_843	ELECTRICIT IN OMAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AN STEEL
Line_844	IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THE IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHE
Line_845	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO THE MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
Line_846	A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
Line_847	THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_848	IT MEANS
Line_849	IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_850	THE WIRES ARE THEIR CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
Line_851	THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
Line_852	THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE A AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_853	WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
Line_854	IT FLOWES TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_855	IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_856	WE'VE BEEN LEARKINING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WISH A BATTERY AND A SOL SOLAR PANEL
Line_857	THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_858	ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
Line_859	ALL THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
Line_860	UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
Line_861	IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
Line_862	IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
Line_863	THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_864	SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THE SMOK
Line_865	THE SUN NEAEDS THE SUN
Line_866	IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN THE FLAG IS TURNING
Line_867	IT STOPS TURNING BCAUSETHER'S NO ENERGY
Line_868	YOU TWO MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
Line_869	I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TO DAY
Line_870	A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO IF ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
Line_871	INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_872	THE ENERGY WON'T THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_873	THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
Line_874	IS YOUR VOICE OCAY
Line_875	I AM WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_876	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_877	IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
Line_878	THE CANDLE IS MELTING
Line_879	LIGHT
Line_880	THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING CAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKE IT
Line_881	THE FLAME IS MOVING
Line_882	I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE A FRYLM BLM BLM BLM BLM BLM B
Line_883	THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DELICIOUS
Line_884	THERE WILL BE SMOKE OR STEM
Line_885	IT GETS FALGEY OR SMOKY
Line_886	I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
Line_887	IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I'VE ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
Line_888	IT IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
Line_889	I'M NOT SURE COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_890	GOOD BYE MARNEY I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
Line_891	I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_892	SERIES AND PARALLEL
Line_893	THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AND A PARALLEL CIRCUI
Line_894	P U SORRY UM THERE IS ONE D CELL A TWO BULB
Line_895	ITS SHORTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRIGHTER
Line_896	THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
Line_897	FROM THE BATTERY IT GO GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TOH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK TO THE BATTER
Line_898	IT'S FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
Line_899	IT'S ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AMAGAS DO NOT GET THE CONSEP
Line_900	OH UM IT'S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND BACK IN
Line_901	THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS OLING ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_902	THE IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU PUT IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT BUT HONE IT'S AND THE BACE AND THE CASING THEN IT'S THERE OCAY
Line_903	IT'S A SERIES CIRCUITYAH
Line_904	YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARN THAT THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IR
Line_905	THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
Line_906	BECAUSE IF MAGNETIC FORCE
Line_907	THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
Line_908	ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT'S REALLY WEAR THAT THE BLACK ROCK STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
Line_909	IT WON'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_910	DOES IT DOES NOT STICK
Line_911	YES WHY ELSE WOULD IT STICK
Line_912	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
Line_913	IT STICKS
Line_914	BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_915	METALOALE
Line_916	THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER
Line_917	THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
Line_918	THEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
Line_919	MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_920	SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE APPOEN
Line_921	THEY'RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
Line_922	THAT'S IT'S NORTH THOE SOUTH OR SOUTH THE NORTH
Line_923	THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT'S BECAUSETHEY'RE REPELLING EACH OTHER EXCEPT FOR THE BOM THOSE ARE TTRACTING
Line_924	THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLD
Line_925	THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE I USING A COMPESS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
Line_926	I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_927	WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
Line_928	THE MAGNET IS PICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS EVEN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
Line_929	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY'RE MOVING EACH OTHR
Line_930	IT'S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT'S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH THE TABLE
Line_931	IF IT'S REALLY SIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT'S REALLY SICK THEN IT CAN'T
Line_932	UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THE'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CANT STICK TOGETHER
Line_933	SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_934	THERE 'S UM THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THE PA
Line_935	THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
Line_936	IT TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
Line_937	WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
Line_938	THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANYMORE
Line_939	PIT CAS THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHELL THE NAIL IS ON THERE ON MEAN WHELLE THE MAGNET'S ON THERE
Line_940	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S TRANSFORING INTO THE NAIL
Line_941	THE MAGNETISIM IS TRANSFERING BETWEEN OBJECTS
Line_942	I'M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
Line_943	WE WEREN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND THAT THEY STICK TO
Line_944	THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO WHOLD THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPERBECAUSE IT'S
Line_945	THERE'S NOT ENOUGGH ATTRACTION IT'S TO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_946	WELL WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROK THE MAGNETIC
Line_947	THERE ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN
Line_948	MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
Line_949	THE THERE ARE SIX PACERS THERE AND SO IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER IT'LL CLICK
Line_950	IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER AND HERE'S MORE SPACE THEN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
Line_951	MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEAK R
Line_952	UM YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
Line_953	IT UM MIXKES THE FOURCE WEAK ER THE FOURCE IN BETWEEN
Line_954	YOU' IN FINDE HOW ARE YOU
Line_955	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WORK IN A CIRCUIT HE L
Line_956	I SEE CANDLEMY PHANCE  T'S IN HE FIRE
Line_957	I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING EAH I'M NOT SHURE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_958	UH IT'S NOT MOVING
Line_959	THE FIRE BURNING IS PROFE THAT ENERGY IS PRESENT
Line_960	ENERGY HELPS US
Line_961	THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
Line_962	FRINGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUTOF METAL I THINK NO IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_963	THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRINGE
Line_964	REFRIGERATE DOES THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EVEN METAL
Line_965	WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL THAT COULD STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON IMPOSSIBLY METAL
Line_966	BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD AND THIS UH STEEL NAIL WAS IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL
Line_967	THEY ARE BOTH MADE AS STEEL
Line_968	BECAUSE THE WIE ONE ISN'T MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_969	IT THE METAL HAS TO HAVE LIKE STEEL OR LIKE IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
Line_970	IT'S MADE OUT IT'S PRY HOW PR AS LIKE METAL ON THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL OR LIKE IRON AND THE INSIDE
Line_971	THE IRON IND OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
Line_972	IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIM
Line_973	STEEL OR IRON MARNIY
Line_974	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW  CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTORS WORK AND HOW TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
Line_975	THE WIRE U BOT THE LIGHT
Line_976	WIRE BATTERY AND A LA
Line_977	THE WIRES LIKE THEY MAKE UP ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FOM ANOTHER UM S
Line_978	THEY ARE CALLED UWIRES
Line_979	THEY MAKE THE UM THE WIRE UM UM CARL
Line_980	IT PROVIDES UMHOW THE
Line_981	THAT THE D CELL MAKES A UM
Line_982	TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WATER TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGH
Line_983	IT WILL SET OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL UM UM T
Line_984	WIRES THEY UM CA ELECTRICITY SOUM THE LIGHT BULB CA LI
Line_985	THE THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP TO LIGHT BULB
Line_986	THE WIRES CARRY  ELECTRICITYES HOE THE BATTERIES CAN THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
Line_987	THE BATTERY IS UM RECEIVIN THE THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING UM THE EGY FROM THE
Line_988	IT'S FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO
Line_989	E THE PART THAT THE ENERGY IS FULLG OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
Line_990	THE BLUE DODS REPROZETE UM THE ELECTRICIT
Line_991	IT SLIPED OVER SO
Line_992	SO IF YOU SLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
Line_993	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BAT
Line_994	THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE UM UM ONE OF THE WIRES UM CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE
Line_995	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE BULB LIGHT
Line_996	THE MOTOR TURNS BUG BY UM THE D CELL
Line_997	THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BACK TO THE MOTOR AND THE UM D CELL
Line_998	THE BATTERY DOES TO BRE THE BATTERY BRINGS A ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTIVE FROM THE WI
Line_999	CAN YE REPEATED THAT IT
Line_1000	THE SWITCH IN THE PIXTURE IS SO LIKE IT BURNED IT ON
Line_1001	THE MOTORS TUS UM SPINNING AGAIN
Line_1002	IT'S CLO OLBING
Line_1003	I NOTICE THAT UM THE UM THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON UM IT SPENDSE AND UM
Line_1004	IT CAN YOU REPECKE THOUT IT
Line_1005	UH IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE  THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FOWING TO THE MOTOR YET BUT WHEN I CLOSE IT IT WILL
Line_1006	IT DOESN'T MOVE OR IT DOESN'T MAKE THOR ELECTRICITY UM FLA TO THE MOTOR MY COECT
Line_1007	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GO GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
Line_1008	THE SOLLIT POWDER IS COLLECTING SUNLIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TRO THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD
Line_1009	WOUN'T BRING ELECTRICITY IN TO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIN
Line_1010	IT'S UM THE MOTOR SPANS THE
Line_1011	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO U COMPLETE UMOST A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1012	I NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SPONING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE MIDDAL PO
Line_1013	R I DON'T KNEAW
Line_1014	ANHU
Line_1015	I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE INSULATORS ARE OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT
Line_1016	CONDUCTORS ARE UM OTHER PARTS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_1017	O GAY BYE MONEY WELL IT'S THAT YOU NEA
Line_1018	I'M DOING BAD TO DAY
Line_1019	WEL WHIY DON'T YOU ASK ME ABOUT H HOW I'M FEELING
Line_1020	UH YOU JUST MEAN I DON'T LIKE
Line_1021	WIRES DO SOW ON LIGHT BULB
Line_1022	THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE SID
Line_1023	I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
Line_1024	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND UPARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1025	BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHGJER LIKE CRNICKS AND HAVE LI
Line_1026	I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIREN AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE M FROM THE HEAT
Line_1027	LIGHT ENERGY
Line_1028	IT DOS UN' LIKE ANYTHING JUST WHAT
Line_1029	I COULD SEE THAT THE HEAT ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND YEAHB
Line_1030	UH CAN YOU REPEET THAT AGIN
Line_1031	WEN UM ACTUALLY DOING PRTY GOOD
Line_1032	UH WE 'T'S BEEN DOING UM PHOWE
Line_1033	IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
Line_1034	THE BLUE DOTS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1035	UH CAN WE PEEKE THAT AGAIN
Line_1036	UH CAN YOU PEAT THAT POLEIECE
Line_1037	THERE IS TWE UM SOLMENT
Line_1038	THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
Line_1039	UM IF YOU AD MORE D CELLS THAN IT WILL GET BRIGHTER AS THE TIME YOU AD MORE D CELL
Line_1040	UM ONE BATTERY ONE
Line_1041	THE ONE D CEL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1042	IF YOU  HAVE A PONAGE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECT TOGETHER
Line_1043	BYE OAVE A GOOD DAY
Line_1044	CIRCUITS
Line_1045	LIGHT BULB WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1046	THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT NO
Line_1047	IT
Line_1048	IT'S IT'S JUST THE USE OF ENERGY
Line_1049	OKAY UM WEOLN'T WILL DUN
Line_1050	THEY SERVE YOU LIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO LIGHT
Line_1051	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
Line_1052	THE MINES SINE
Line_1053	IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE THAT THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
Line_1054	IT FLOWES IN THE UM PLUSS SIGNE AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINAS CEL
Line_1055	MOLECULS OR ELECTRICITY BULLS LIKE MITTAL BULLS OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1056	OKY HEAPS OM FIGNE
Line_1057	THE MINES SINE
Line_1058	I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING MARNEY
Line_1059	IT WOULDN'T START IT WOULD JUST STOP
Line_1060	EITHER WAIY YOU CLICK ONE WIRE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
Line_1061	BYE MARNEY SEE YOU NEXT T
Line_1062	I WAS BILDING A CIRCUIT STILL
Line_1063	THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND INTO THE D CELL
Line_1064	TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS RUNNING AND THAN IT IS ON AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
Line_1065	ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE PATTERYWELT
Line_1066	THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NOW RUNNING
Line_1067	THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
Line_1068	WHEN IT'S NOT MEXTD TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE METAL IT'S ON
Line_1069	THE MOTOR IS LEARNING
Line_1070	BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT'S WEL METAL AND IT IT'S LIKE ELECTRIC FYING TO THE WIRES
Line_1071	IT STOPS
Line_1072	WHEN I  CLICK DI IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
Line_1073	THE MOTOR THE THE FLAG AS TOD FLOWING ITS AND THE MOTOR STOPS MOVING
Line_1074	THERE IS THE LITTLE HEX GOMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
Line_1075	ENERGY FOR THE SUN OR ANY KIND OF LIKE ELECTRICITY
Line_1076	ENERGY IS FLOWING TROUGH THE PANEL AND MA T IN THE WIRE
Line_1077	IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
Line_1078	IT WOLDN'T SERVE ANY ENERGY
Line_1079	THE MOTOR MOVES IT'S ON
Line_1080	IT TRRS SETS OFF HIT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1081	IT MAKES THE IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND IN TO THE MOTOR
Line_1082	IT DOESN'T MOVE
Line_1083	NOTHING 'S HAPPENING
Line_1084	DO TWO MORELIES STEERE LATER HAVE A GOOD DITD TO BY
Line_1085	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
Line_1086	THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
Line_1087	ELECTRIUM METAL STUFF
Line_1088	I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD WORKBUT
Line_1089	THEY'RE ALL METAL
Line_1090	UM I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING A LB JUST BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS
Line_1091	I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THAT IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH ON THE WIRE
Line_1092	IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK BUT IF IT WON'T IF IT'S METAL IT'LL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTICK IT WON'T WORK
Line_1093	THERE IS WOOD REIGH THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTE IS NOT MOVING
Line_1094	IT'S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1095	IT'S PLASTICK SO IT WON'T WORK
Line_1096	THE INSULLATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL
Line_1097	I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_1098	THE CONDUCTORS ARE  THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS
Line_1099	WHEN I CLICKED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED THE MOTORS STARTED RUNNING
Line_1100	THE WIRES THE D CELL THE SWITCH AND A SCREEN
Line_1101	I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
Line_1102	THE CANDL IS MELTING BECAUSE THE HEAT AND THE JET'S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
Line_1103	WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGH AND IT TO PORVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
Line_1104	I SEE YOU STICK THAT KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
Line_1105	LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
Line_1106	YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
Line_1107	I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
Line_1108	THE FIRE
Line_1109	THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE THE PLASTICK AND IT'S SOUNDA
Line_1110	SHE IS EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALL SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAON
Line_1111	MAPPLES
Line_1112	THE FIEEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
Line_1113	THEREWILL BE SWET
Line_1114	IT GETS THE FIRE MAKES THE EI HOT AND SMOE COMES FILLS THE AIR
Line_1115	THE SOLAID POWNEL
Line_1116	GASS WOOD WINDMILS SOLAD ANIEALS
Line_1117	BECAUSE THEY BUL SIRVED ENERGY
Line_1118	WE BOTH ENERGY INUM AND THE BOTH SERVE ENERGY
Line_1119	THEY BUL AR FEUWAL
Line_1120	BECAUSE THEY DON'T SERMEN THEY JUST GETT SMOKE AND THE GASS MAKES THE CAR MOVE
Line_1121	IT DOAESN'T WORK
Line_1122	THE SOLOW PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GASS DOESERT
Line_1123	THEY SIERVE AS MEOTE AND WOLLE VIEW INS BREETH
Line_1124	IT WON'T WORK
Line_1125	MAKES THE FLIGHT UP
Line_1126	THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING IS LIGHTING UP
Line_1127	THEY'ARE JUST THE SAME
Line_1128	THE BATTERY AND THE FILLMENTS AND THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_1129	ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1130	IT CAN USUALLY FLOW ANYWHARE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
Line_1131	AND IF IT'S ONLY METAL IT WILL WORK LIKE A SWITCH OLTHOST CIRCUIT IT WILL WORK
Line_1132	HOH IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
Line_1133	THEY WILL GET DOECAR
Line_1134	THEY BUB THEY ONE GETS RIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
Line_1135	BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
Line_1136	WHEN U CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLICKED IT AGAIN THEY STOPED WORKING
Line_1137	WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FASING THE SAME WAY
Line_1138	BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
Line_1139	UHM I HAVE BEEN DOING M A LOT OF STUFF UH MUGNETS
Line_1140	UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
Line_1141	A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_1142	THE LIGHT BULB IS CONSEARNING EVERGY
Line_1143	I ONTLY KNOW A MOMENT NOW
Line_1144	THEY'RE LIGHTING P VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY TS FLOWING THROUGH THE FILL MA
Line_1145	UM HOW WELL I KNO
Line_1146	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1147	IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
Line_1148	I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
Line_1149	THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE BATTERIES A MID THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERIY
Line_1150	THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
Line_1151	I SEE BATTERIES ON IESIDES
Line_1152	IT'S NOT REALLY A COMPLEETE CIRCUIT
Line_1153	MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
Line_1154	I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FORE WIRES AND THE ONE BATTERY
Line_1155	THE FIRST ONE
Line_1156	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
Line_1157	IT'S A CIRCUIT A COMPLEETE CIRCUIT OH AN IN COMPLEETE CIRCUIT
Line_1158	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRE
Line_1159	THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
Line_1160	STRINGS OF LIGHTS ARE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_1161	IT'S KINO LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_1162	THE BA THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DINE
Line_1163	WIERES IND A BATTERY AND TUP U
Line_1164	BECAUSE IT'S LIKE  NORMAL CIRCUIT IT'S JUST WITH A SWITCH AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD THAT LEGL THING ON IT
Line_1165	BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DING
Line_1166	THE FILLAMENT DIDE
Line_1167	THE FILLMENT DIED ON THE BATTERY
Line_1168	THE FILMAN DIES AND THE WHEIGHT IN THE WEIGHT
Line_1169	A FILLMEAN DING ON A BATTERY
Line_1170	IN COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDESENT CIRCUITS AND I CANT REMEMBER THE RES
Line_1171	IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILMENT ISN'T DYING
Line_1172	WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILMENT BREAKES AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS MO
Line_1173	THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINES SIGNE AND THREE WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUSE SIGN
Line_1174	AN IN COMPLEETE CIRCUIT
Line_1175	IT THE FILLAMENT IS DING
Line_1176	BECAUSE IT STARTS WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN ITS
Line_1177	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE UM LIGHT BULB ISN'T THERE
Line_1178	WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND CANDESCENT CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
Line_1179	GOD HOW YOU
Line_1180	I MEAN  SO WELE NOE  LAH MAGNETS
Line_1181	YOU CAN STICK ON TO  SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH SO THERE AE NOT TO BE OPOSIT SO HIKE CAN STICK
Line_1182	THEY'RE ATTRACTING TO THE FRIDGE
Line_1183	BECAUSE IT'S STICKING ON EACH SIDE
Line_1184	ONE OF THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
Line_1185	THE MAGNET AND THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL THE WHOT ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST
Line_1186	STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL AMPE THELS IT
Line_1187	BECBECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD DIES NOT
Line_1188	THEY'E BOTH METAL
Line_1189	THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOTH
Line_1190	METAL COPPER STEEL AND
Line_1191	THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT METAL
Line_1192	ONE OF THUM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
Line_1193	ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL FIT WELL FIT IN AND STICK
Line_1194	YES IT HAS A LOT OF TWOOMBS
Line_1195	IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS TOOM
Line_1196	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING TO THE PAPER CLIP
Line_1197	TL STON
Line_1198	THESE ARARE MAGNET THINGS
Line_1199	MAGNET THINGS
Line_1200	TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1201	ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES
Line_1202	I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WENT ON
Line_1203	YES
Line_1204	IT DALL STOPS AND IT DOLLS FALL AND IT DOLL FULL
Line_1205	NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
Line_1206	THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BILD UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
Line_1207	I NEED THAT HAVE ALL THE SURPLISE I NEED TO MAKE IT
Line_1208	I NEED WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETSTHREE WIRES AND A BATTE
Line_1209	FLIS AND  HBLES  THE AE
Line_1210	THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT'S ON AND IF IT'S NOT OFF IF IT'S  NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIV
Line_1211	I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVIT STOPED FLOWING ENERGY AND AND THE CIRCUIT STOPED AND THE MAGNET
Line_1212	UM PO YER
Line_1213	OPEN BEANG CLOSED
Line_1214	THE ELECTRICITY IT'S LIKE THE FORCE IT'S PULLING UP THE MAGNETS BY THE RIVEIT
Line_1215	THAC TRICCITY IS MOVING
Line_1216	I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGEIC
Line_1217	NOTHING BECAUSE THE THE SWITCH IS NOT
Line_1218	REVT AND MIRES AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY AND THE BATTERY AND THE MAGNET
Line_1219	H CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN A LIGHT BULB OM
Line_1220	IT'S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
Line_1221	THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDS TE THE POWER IN THROUGH THE WIRE AND IN TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT TURNA
Line_1222	THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOKED TO THE BATTERY TOMAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1223	THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
Line_1224	AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S THE PATHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY GO GO THROUGH
Line_1225	THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BUB
Line_1226	THAT MEANS THAT THAT'S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY THE WHAT'S RECEVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BACK
Line_1227	THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MY HOUSE
Line_1228	ELECTRICITY FLOWES INTO THE  D CELL TOWARDS THE THE POS THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1229	BLUE THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
Line_1230	IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE
Line_1231	I WAS ABSENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
Line_1232	I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK IT SO
Line_1233	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PARNELS AND HOWGING A SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING FRIION AND HEAT AND STUFF
Line_1234	A CONDUCTOR AND MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
Line_1235	I NOTICE THAT ALL THE PIECS ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WEREN'T METAL DIDN'T WORK
Line_1236	ININSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THER  THE THINGS LIKE THE PLASTIC AROUNT THE WIRES THAT HELPS
Line_1237	THE OBJECTS ETER INSULATORS DO NOT WORK AS CONDUCT
Line_1238	THE CIRCUIT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRI
Line_1239	THAT CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND EL ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
Line_1240	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES THINGS WORK AND WITHOUT ENERGY IT NOTHING WOULD WORK
Line_1241	THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS
Line_1242	YEAH YOU HEAR T LITTLE CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
Line_1243	IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TIPE OF SOUND
Line_1244	THE FLAME IS BURNING
Line_1245	WHEN YOU PUT THE HANDS POWD ON THE DRUMS IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
Line_1246	BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING AND WHEN SHE EACH WHOI'S GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOODS SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALN
Line_1247	YES YOU CAN HEAR A NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
Line_1248	I THINK THE GIRLS EATING AND ISCAMING HER ENERGY SOTHAT SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
Line_1249	IT WON'T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
Line_1250	IT PULLTS THE AIR THE AIR GETS ALL DIRTY AND NOT GOOD YOU FOR YOU TO BREETHE IT
Line_1251	THE AIR AROUND IT BECOMES ALL SMOKIY
Line_1252	THEY ARE SIMMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY AND STORIT
Line_1253	THE GASOLINE AND THE COL ARE SOMERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
Line_1254	COAL AND GLASS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BURN THE
Line_1255	COAL AND DAS WHOULD HAVE A BAD EFECT ON THE VIRAN BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BRING
Line_1256	I THINK I'M GOOD HOW ATHOAUT YOU
Line_1257	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TIPES OF THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1258	THE ELECTRICITY AND A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED
Line_1259	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FROM THE BULB TO LIGHT
Line_1260	THE MOVEMENTAL ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE W
Line_1261	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1262	THE BUDATS MOVING REPRIESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCUIT
Line_1263	THERE IS ONE PAH THE THERE IS ONE PATHWAY AND A SERIES SE
Line_1264	THE ONE WITH
Line_1265	BYE MORNE
Line_1266	VERY WELL HOW ABOUT
Line_1267	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
Line_1268	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLELL CIRCUIT
Line_1269	IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_1270	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE
Line_1271	THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_1272	BECAUSE THERE IS TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ON
Line_1273	I THINK THE FLOWE GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
Line_1274	THE END IN THE BATTERY WHERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES IT JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_1275	I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE SIDE OF THE CE OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULBING GOES INTO THE POSITIV
Line_1276	I NOTICE THAT THE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING ONE LIGHT BULB N AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS
Line_1277	A OU UH HOW A YOU GET
Line_1278	A LIGHT BULB WIRES AND WIRES AND AND TE BATTERY
Line_1279	THEY WIGH THEY THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
Line_1280	SOURCE IS THE SAME DI
Line_1281	WELL IT'S THE SAME THIN
Line_1282	ENERGY
Line_1283	WIRES CARRY LIKE LITTLE WHIGTE D
Line_1284	WILL THELIGTE UP AND
Line_1285	THERE IS A BATTERY THIS WI THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT UP AND THERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE GOAIT DON
Line_1286	CKITTY CAIL LIND AGAIN
Line_1287	IT IS GOING TO THE LIGHT
Line_1288	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GOING LICTD THE SAME W
Line_1289	THEYARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENTLY
Line_1290	IT IS FIRST WY AND THEN IT CHARNGES YELLOW SO IT CHARN
Line_1291	LOOK AT CE NEX
Line_1292	WE HAVE BEENDOING LIKE TO MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GOIN
Line_1293	WELL THE GREY CEK IS THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATT
Line_1294	IT IS A PAL BECAUSE MOTOR I THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAW MOVE
Line_1295	IT MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING
Line_1296	IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE ABOUND ANER
Line_1297	IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
Line_1298	I DON'T THAT
Line_1299	IT HAS LIKE IT HAS ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKE ING ENERGY FROM THE BATT
Line_1300	THE THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1301	THE FLAGX TARTS MOVING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_1302	THE SWITCH HAS TO IT HAS TO CLICK THE WIRES AND THEN IT'L STA THE FLAG WILL STA
Line_1303	WHEN THE SWITCH IT'S THE WIRE THE FLAG STARTS
Line_1304	IT STARTS MOVING THE FLAG AT
Line_1305	I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DO  YET
Line_1306	THE GREET PEACE WITH IT SUNY
Line_1307	WELL CAN A CLOUDY DAY
Line_1308	IT TURNS BRIGHT WHEN YOU CLLIC THE SUN
Line_1309	THE FLAG STARTS MOVIN
Line_1310	WHEN IT IS WALKING THE FLAG STUPS
Line_1311	WE HAVE BEEN UM
Line_1312	I U SEE THE FLAG VE IN
Line_1313	THETHE FLAG IS GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTE
Line_1314	WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRE SO THATS MAKING THE FLAG
Line_1315	PRESSING THE UM WIRE AND THE  SWIT
Line_1316	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1317	CLOES
Line_1318	IT'S NOT MOVING BECAUSE SO THE STICK
Line_1319	IT IS THE STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
Line_1320	OH I DON'T NOY KNOW BECAUSE I AN'T  WARE LEARNING TH
Line_1321	O CAS SO S THE PLASTICK
Line_1322	THE STEEL MEAT THE STEEL
Line_1323	YOU TWO BYE MARNEY
Line_1324	WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUIT
Line_1325	THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND ITS TOUCHING THE WIRES AND THE FLAG IS LOUMIN BY THE AREC
Line_1326	I THE SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND ROUND AN
Line_1327	THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
Line_1328	BECAUSE IT S HO METAL
Line_1329	IT STOPS UMIT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOES NOT WORK
Line_1330	UH SO
Line_1331	YOARE MARNEY AY
Line_1332	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
Line_1333	I SEE A CANNEL AND FIRE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STICKPLAHI IT'S GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GOING TO MELK THO CAN
Line_1334	BECAUS WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BRETH
Line_1335	IT MOUNT S CAUSE OF THE FIRE  IT MOUNTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
Line_1336	IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT WE CAN SO THAT IT'S IRONY
Line_1337	NOB I COULD NOT SA THAT THINGG
Line_1338	IT WAS A SOLVN D IT WAS FIRE
Line_1339	IN THE SCAKE OF THE ENERGY OFFON BEDHWEI
Line_1340	IT MAKES SOUND SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
Line_1341	UEDH
Line_1342	I SEE WOOD GAS BOPBLE EPPLES AND OF FIRE
Line_1343	MEAL WIRE APPLE WOOD BLACK STUFF AND A
Line_1344	IT GOES ON IT ON
Line_1345	THE SOLOPI E USE RY AND
Line_1346	IUYET
Line_1347	A CIRCUIT IS
Line_1348	WE HAVE BEEN LARKING MAGNEC
Line_1349	UH THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IS STREAHT ONE IS HEURVED AND THE ONE IS A CIRCLE
Line_1350	THEYT'S  CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON IN
Line_1351	IT STICKS TO A REFLIURREFRIGERATOR
Line_1352	WELL IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATE HAS IRON
Line_1353	WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE MMATTIC IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNIC AND SO THE FRUYGERATOR IS MAG
Line_1354	WELL THAT THIS THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTED TO THE R
Line_1355	THEY IS SO GOD BECAUSE THAT I UH THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
Line_1356	THE MAGN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE THIS GREWP
Line_1357	WELL A TRACHICIDY DOUSE BUT A GAT DOESN'T
Line_1358	WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE  IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IN
Line_1359	DUBLEBEANS
Line_1360	BECUSH IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON
Line_1361	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1362	IT STICKS TO IRON
Line_1363	BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN I
Line_1364	BECAUSE WHAT HAS IRON IT W DOESN'T
Line_1365	I
Line_1366	IT WILL YEA
Line_1367	ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
Line_1368	THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BA
Line_1369	THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHTUL
Line_1370	UM EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THA LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WAIST THE ENERGY
Line_1371	THTHE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D CELL AND THE PLUS SIGT
Line_1372	IT GOES BACK TO ITS NORMAL SHAPE
Line_1373	I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHEN EVER I PUSH
Line_1374	THE I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EACH END
Line_1375	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1376	THE MOTOR IS MAVING IT'S LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED
Line_1377	I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN NOT PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IS STARTED TO MOVE
Line_1378	THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE ITS LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK A NEED METAL
Line_1379	THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOD WOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TIYPE OF METAL OR TIYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
Line_1380	BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF TRICITY FOR A PIECE OF AND NO JE
Line_1381	ILL IN SIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
Line_1382	INSUOLATORS ARE ARE HELPFUL
Line_1383	IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ENNERY
Line_1384	SOE
Line_1385	WE'VE BEEN BILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
Line_1386	CAN THEY REPEETE THAT
Line_1387	BECAUSE THE WAX IT ITS MELTING
Line_1388	HEAT ENERGY HEATE ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1389	IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WHEN THE WAX MELTED AND DROPE I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKET
Line_1390	IT'S HEADING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING TOM
Line_1391	YOU'RE GIVING OUT YOU'R ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GETTING NOT IT ALL FOCUICED UM THE SOUNDS AND HOW YOU WANT IT
Line_1392	THE APPLE AND HER FEAET
Line_1393	UM IT SHE IS GETTING IN TA ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE IS
Line_1394	THE ANNAPPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PEN
Line_1395	WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK BECAUSE GASS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1396	FROM BECAUSE  THE COAL HAS BEEN BYURNED AND THE GASS HAS INT I GUESS
Line_1397	IT WON'T MOUNT THE ERTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREESE AND EVERYTHING
Line_1398	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SOURCE OF ENERGY
Line_1399	WORK THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NOT A REMRUL O
Line_1400	IT IS TA COMPLETE TORMAT OR A LIGHT BULBED WORK
Line_1401	WELL UM I THINK THAT THE LIHE THE DOFTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BUMB IGTER
Line_1402	THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FORE THERE IS FORE PATHWAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1403	HA I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO UM D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORT OF ENERGY SO IT WOLD WORK
Line_1404	UM I THINK TWORK MAYBE
Line_1405	E MEANG CI YOU HURRIED UM
Line_1406	BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLS OF THE WIRES AND THEY DAR ON'T SUPPOSE TO BE TOUCHING
Line_1407	THE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING
Line_1408	THE ENERGY IS STWORD AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TI LIGHT BULBS
Line_1409	WE NO THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THERE'S THREE WIRES IS A SWITCH
Line_1410	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A THERE
Line_1411	MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK OR LY S AND WHAT DOES IT WORK
Line_1412	UH IPO
Line_1413	THAT WHAN THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE
Line_1414	TILL THE CURRENT STOPS
Line_1415	SEE TE I'M SEEEND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT
Line_1416	BEADDY E COU'D SWITCH PT FOR A NE ONE
Line_1417	I THINNK THAT'S THE BATTERY
Line_1418	OD BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHILE YOU ARE TALKING AND I'M SICK
Line_1419	UM STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1420	WHOULD A STRIGA LIGHT EESE PARTY
Line_1421	WIRES WHOLDS LIKE E ENERGY INT STUFF
Line_1422	WELH IT WON'T WORK EMORB BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE THE ENERGY JUS WHOLD BAT
Line_1423	THE IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALREADY DRYGED OUT IN STUF
Line_1424	UB I DO NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
Line_1425	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SA THE WR
Line_1426	OH MARD AND CAN I PLEASE JUST FIIYOU
Line_1427	I BUM BROKE AND THAT THE
Line_1428	IT WOL'T BRROKE SO IT DODN'T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO CHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER
Line_1429	WE SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A POVE
Line_1430	ON'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S STUDDED IT'S  THE WORK
Line_1431	THE FLOW IS THAT ELECTRICITY GON ON THE THREE WIRES
Line_1432	UHM  IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER
Line_1433	FRO GAT  IT DOESN'T LIGHT ANDY WORK
Line_1434	WEL  WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERYE
Line_1435	BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A CUPLE OF WIRE
Line_1436	WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO
Line_1437	UM IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Line_1438	THE METAL MAKES IT TO LRN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVES SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GOE THROUGH
Line_1439	UM IT MEANS UM THERE'S A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP FLOW POWER SORCE KEEP GOING THRUH
Line_1440	UPOWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
Line_1441	THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF FLASH LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TO WHOLD IN YOUR HAN
Line_1442	IT RECEIVES POWER AND FROM THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_1443	IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND DNEVERMI
Line_1444	I NOTICE THAT UM THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO TO
Line_1445	UM WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
Line_1446	IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
Line_1447	IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP BECAUSE UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN AND DIFFERENT PARTS
Line_1448	NO LIGHT CAME AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHI IT'S I DIDN'T INVENT ELECTRICITY
Line_1449	BYE AND UM I CAN SEE THE PIXTURE BYE THE WAY
Line_1450	THE D CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MO
Line_1451	IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING US POWER
Line_1452	IT MEANS UM THE POWER SOURCE IS GOING THROUGH THE WIR
Line_1453	U AN SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
Line_1454	THE POWER AND THE WIRES
Line_1455	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES  THE SOURCE POWER
Line_1456	UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
Line_1457	UM THE THE PERSON WHO DID IT PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO NOW
Line_1458	IT GIVES IT IT GIVES THE POWER SORCE POWER
Line_1459	UM I THINK THAT MEANS THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN FOR
Line_1460	ITALE HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
Line_1461	WHENEVER I CLICK IT IT IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
Line_1462	SH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RGHT WAY
Line_1463	UM WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT THEM MEA BECAUSE THE PAT THE WE GOT THE LEIDE BY THE SNOW
Line_1464	THE SUNLIGHT IS HELPING THE THE LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
Line_1465	IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS
Line_1466	WE ARE TRYING TO MIKE SHURE CAPES OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_1467	SWITCH AND ME A WOMEN A NAIL INR
Line_1468	UH D CELL THE ARUBIUM THE OLD SLITCHED METAL AND LOR
Line_1469	THE SWITCH THE METAL
Line_1470	UM WELL ITS TOUCHING THE SWITCH AND THE METTAL TS AKING
Line_1471	THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1472	THERE'S NOTHING REALLY ELS TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST WHON
Line_1473	IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOW
Line_1474	WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND WE
Line_1475	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS JUS USE THINGS TH LGHT BETTER
Line_1476	THE WAX IS MELTING OFF
Line_1477	THE FLAME GLARES OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
Line_1478	IT BURNS THE WAXI IT MELTS
Line_1479	IT'S FOUNDED CAN MET LIKE POPPING A LITLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG FLAM
Line_1480	SOMEBODY'S HEITING THE BOUNGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENER
Line_1481	SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRIYING AND THAT'S IT
Line_1482	APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DUSC A FAN TREE BRANCHES RASOINS AND FIUELD
Line_1483	IT GIVES MORE AIR BECAUSE F THE FTHE
Line_1484	THE FIRE CULD THE FIRE CULD PULL EACH AIR AND THE
Line_1485	IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT EFFECTS THE AIR
Line_1486	IT'S NONE AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
Line_1487	HI
Line_1488	WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING THEM THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY OULD STICK
Line_1489	TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A FAN AN THE MOLTR
Line_1490	IT HELPS US USE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH OURSELVES
Line_1491	IF YOU DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY IT COULD SHOCK YOU OR UM IT CAN HERT
Line_1492	WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
Line_1493	UM THE FRONT OF THE IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGNE DOWN TO THE MINES
Line_1494	THOSE ARE THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND THE
Line_1495	IT HAS TO FLL THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETLY AND IF IT GETS STUCK ITWORK
Line_1496	THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D CELL THE LIGHTS AR DIMMER THE ONE WITH TWO D CELLS THE LIGHTH ARE
Line_1497	IT WILL GET REALLY LIGHT AND WEIGH
Line_1498	THE ONE D CELL MAY BE DIMMER BUT TWO D CELLS RUNES BATTERIES HOT REALY QUIT
Line_1499	WHEN I CLICK ON THE D CELL IT MOVES IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
Line_1500	WHEN I CLICKS THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
Line_1501	SERIES CIRCUITS AND SOME OTHER
Line_1502	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE ON BOTH THINGS SO IT MAKES IT BRIGH
Line_1503	THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TWICE TO EACH THING
Line_1504	THERE IS MEANY OF THEM
Line_1505	WHEN THE SERIES SERIES CIRCUITS HAVE MORE WIRES
Line_1506	BECAUSE THE MIT'S NOT A COMPLEETE SHIR
Line_1507	WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT LIGHTS THE BULB WHEND I THINK THAT HAPPENDS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCI
Line_1508	BECAUSE WHEN IT'S FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE WIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER WHEN THE FILMA BRAKES IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYMORE
Line_1509	UM ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREGK
Line_1510	ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS TROPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
Line_1511	THERE SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE U BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
Line_1512	ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STICKS O
Line_1513	THERE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT

Line_1587	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1588	THAT'S THE MAGNETS STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER OROTHERWILL NOT STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_1589	ONE STEEL OR ONE STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
Line_1590	I DID

Line_1606	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1607	THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE AND IT WILL IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
Line_1608	THEN TLL THE MAGNET GETS TAKING OFF THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKE IT OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
Line_1609	THAT THE MAGNETIVE FORCE IS GOING TROUGH THE PAPER TO TOUCH THE METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
Line_1610	THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE THICK STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS TO

Line_1615	THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
Line_1616	HOW MANY DIFFERENTS ARE NEED TO STAK THA
Line_1617	IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
Line_1618	THE MAGNETIC FORS IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER S
Line_1619	IT TOOK NINE SPACERS TO BRING THE MAGNETS APART
Line_1620	THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
Line_1621	YOU NEED TO RAPP IT AROUNT THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_1622	THAT THE WIRES WRAT RAPPED ABOUT THE RIBET AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE IT LIKE WEL STICK TO THE RIB
Line_1623	SOIT PRODUCES ELECTRIC
Line_1624	A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1625	THAT IT CARRIES LIKE MAGNETISM FORCE H SO IT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METTL STUFF
Line_1626	THAT THE ELECTRO MAGNET I CAN CARRY METAL STUFF
Line_1627	THAT THE ELECTRIELECTRO MAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
Line_1628	THAT IIT IS NOT AN ELECTRO MAGNET ANYMORE
Line_1629	THAT IS THE ELECTRO MAGNET COULD IT IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE THAT
Line_1630	IT IS CLOSED
Line_1631	IT STARTS TO PICK UP WASHERS
Line_1632	THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSE
Line_1633	THE U SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
Line_1634	BE WRAPPED AROUND WITH WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY SO THE RIVET CAN BE A ELECTROMAGN
Line_1635	I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO USE STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BUL
Line_1636	THERE IS A LIGHT ALL THE WIRES AND A BATTERY
Line_1637	THEY HELP UM THEY HELP UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1638	IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG TOLE TO USE
Line_1639	UM I THINK IT'S A SOURCE BECAUSE UM IT'S A SOURCE TO LIGHT A LIGHT BUL
Line_1640	UM I THINK WHAT TRAVELS AND WIRES IS ENERGY TO TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1641	I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
Line_1642	LIGHT BULBS ARE TO LIGHT A ROUME ORE ANY THING THAT NEEDS LIGHT AND DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
Line_1643	UM I THINK THAT MEANS UM IT'S WEIGHT CAN YOU REPEETE THAT PLEEZE
Line_1644	I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINEST SIGNE BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL I COULD THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVEN'T KNO
Line_1645	GOMES OUT OF THE MINES SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLA
Line_1646	I THINK THE PLUDOCTS REPRESENT ENERGY
Line_1647	IT IS FALLING AWAY FROM THE MINEAS SIDE
Line_1648	COMPONE COMPONENTS NEEDS UM HANG ON
Line_1649	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE EGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK UP ON THE BOTTOUM THEY WILL NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
Line_1650	BY MARNEY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'R GRET HELP
Line_1651	ENERGY HAS TO THROUW FLOW THROUGH THE D CELL IN INTO THE WIRES ANDTHE MOTOR RECEIVES
Line_1652	ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1653	THE D CELL BATTERY IT CREATES THE ENERGY TO MIKE THE MOTOR
Line_1654	THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGE IT JUST LIKE
Line_1655	WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS CLOSED AND NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
Line_1656	THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D CELL BATTERY STOPS
Line_1657	I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE TO A CREATE ENERGY
Line_1658	SOMELIGHT HAS TO HEIT THE SOLAR PANEL
Line_1659	UN IS GIVING THE CEL ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE FLAG SI
Line_1660	THINK IS IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WAST ENERGY ANDWELL IT DOESN'T WAISTE
Line_1661	I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WOULDN'T CREATE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WOULD NOT SPIN
Line_1662	THE FLAG DOES NOT MOVE
Line_1663	ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE CIRCLI
Line_1664	THE D CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS THE WIRES INTO THE TO MAKE THE FLAGS
Line_1665	YOU TWO MARNEY THANK YOU BYE
Line_1666	I'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS BIN AROUND AND
Line_1667	YOU GET TO USE DIFFERENT STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTIV
Line_1668	THE NAIL IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKE THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
Line_1669	THERE IS A D CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAL
Line_1670	I'VE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN BUT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN NOT
Line_1671	THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE UM MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
Line_1672	ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
Line_1673	IF IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK BUT IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT LL WORK LIKE THIS WROCK IT IS NOT METAL SO T T WILL NOT WORK
Line_1674	THE  THINGS OPEN MAYBE
Line_1675	THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWLING THROUGH THE WOOD
Line_1676	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MABY
Line_1677	CLOSED MAYBE
Line_1678	CONDUCTORS ARE ANYTHING METAL THAT CREE CAN CREATE ROM ENERGY OR ELECTRI
Line_1679	I NOTICE THAT THEY'RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC GRUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
Line_1680	BY MARNING I HAD A REALLY GREAT TON
Line_1681	GOODGOOD
Line_1682	GOOD HOW ERE YOU
Line_1683	I HAVE HEDOOH I'V FORGOT IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DON'T T
Line_1684	A CIRCUIT I CIRCUIT
Line_1685	I FORGOT SOLVNTLY
Line_1686	ELECTRICITY AND THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE COLDING THE ENERGY LIKE IT LETS IT ALL
Line_1687	THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY LIKE GOES THROUGH EVERYTHING AND LAMI INTO EVERYTHING IA
Line_1688	IT'S FALLING THROUGH LIGHT BULBS SO MAKE THE LIGHT BULBS LIKHT THE WE
Line_1689	TE BLUE TOGHTS OR THE UH ELECTTRICITY BAYBY
Line_1690	THEY CONNECTOME ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE ITHE LITER REMIND ME OF ELECTRICITY
Line_1691	ME PLOTION IS THAT HIT GOES ABTOLUTLY D CAIL AND GOLES IN ACODLIGHT  BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
Line_1692	ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUH ALL THAT'S METAL IN THE LAGT P
Line_1693	I THINK THERE ARE ONE TWO THRO FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN A NINE
Line_1694	THERE WOULD BE MORE EMUDY AND THE LIGHTBUM LIGHT R
Line_1695	U MORBLE BULBS UM MEANS LESS THAN LIGHT
Line_1696	THEY WILL TURE AND THATS THES NOLERY GOE
Line_1697	I THINK THAT MIGHT BULBS WOULD LIKE RIGHT
Line_1698	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WITH ONE DE CAIL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT THE ONE WILL DO THESE AIS IS VERY VARY BRG
Line_1699	TWO D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT ATALE
Line_1700	I DON'T KNW WHAT YOU A I TO DO
Line_1701	BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GUESS
Line_1702	AT THE ASOFH DOTHOS IAN I WILL MISS YOU
Line_1703	I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICKS TO MAGNET
Line_1704	I THINK THAT IS  M NOT ACTSLOWLY UM NOT ACTUALLY
Line_1705	I THINK THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRS MEAT SPRED YOUR LIGHT BULBS
Line_1706	UARE DREAMING DON'T KNOW
Line_1707	I  OH THINK THAT THE B I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB LIL DIM
Line_1708	I NOTICED I BERDS AND LOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
Line_1709	I THINK THAT THERE ARE OR PATHWAYS MAYBE
Line_1710	THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
Line_1711	I ACTUALLY THINK UM IF IT HAS IT'S OWN IT'S OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
Line_1712	UM I REMEMBER THAT UM IT GOES OUT OF THE PPOSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SI
Line_1713	E I THINK IT IS SWOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SD
Line_1714	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
Line_1715	I THINK WE HAVE TWO PACHAY
Line_1716	UM I DON'T IUILY
Line_1717	I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS MORE WIRE
Line_1718	I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE I WELL I DON'T NOW
Line_1719	I THINK THAT THEY'RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT UM ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
Line_1720	UB I SEENG THAT  TOP FORMB WORK
Line_1721	IT THINKS THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT THIS ARE VERY BRIGHT
Line_1722	I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S THEIR BRIGHTER
Line_1723	I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOUN
Line_1724	I AM LEARNING UM
Line_1725	I KNOW THAT  THE SWITCH IS NOT ON THE VITRZINGLY SO IT THE LABOR S NOT LIGHTYG
Line_1726	BECAUSE THE TWICH IS NOT PRODYCTE PRMIT
Line_1727	MMI THINK THAT THEN THE BUB WILL NOT THE LIGHTYOU WON'
Line_1728	I BULL HE MOAD UM IDAY UDPUM
Line_1729	UM THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO IT DOESN'T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULMB  DOESN'T LIGHT LIGHTE AND UP FORCTRIC AMATIC BLRBS
Line_1730	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THAT THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LEUL IS NOT LIGHTING OF QUAR
Line_1731	I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE UM WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULMB THNAYBY
Line_1732	I THINK THAT WHENEVER THE FILLIMENT BRAKES THE BOTH TO THE LIGHT BULBS TURN OUT IT'S BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB UM HELPS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB LIGHT
Line_1733	I THINK THAT ONE FILLAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS ILIGHTING BECAUSE THE ONE IS BROKE
Line_1734	ONE UM LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT BECAUSE IF THE FILM IS BROKE SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGH
Line_1735	ELECTRICITY COMPLETLY STOP
Line_1736	I THINK WHAT HCOMES WHEN A BULB BREAKES IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FULL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
Line_1737	UM A PARALLEL MAOR
Line_1738	UM WHENEVER ONE BRAKES THE OTHER IT'S THE LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HASE IT'S OWN WIRES
Line_1739	IN ORDERS OTULB WHATEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILLMENT BREAKES BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
Line_1740	WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB UONE THE ENERGY COMPOLEATELY STOPS
Line_1741	UM I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKES THE OTHER ONES STILL
Line_1742	THIS PIXTURE HAS TO DO WITH A BULB BURNING UT BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNT OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES SENE
Line_1743	UM I SEE THAT THERE WIRES AND THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTED BUT IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TOTHE LIGHTE ILL
Line_1744	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T
Line_1745	WHEN EVER ONE BULB BURNS A THE OTHER ONE BREAKS OUT
Line_1746	I DON'T KNOW
Line_1747	WHENEVER A ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
Line_1748	WHENEVER ONE UM LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT UM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
Line_1749	THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
Line_1750	I THINK THAT UM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT ONE FILLAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER UM LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
Line_1751	WHENEVER THE FILLMENT BREAKES THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
Line_1752	THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILLMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT
Line_1753	UM I THINK  I DON'T KNOW
Line_1754	THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN LIGHT UM WIRE
Line_1755	I THINK THAT EACH ENT EVERY ONE HAS THEIR OWN WIDE ETH UM WHEN EVER ONE FILLMENT BREAKES THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS
Line_1756	ECTRICITY STOPS THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
Line_1757	I SAY I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
Line_1758	UM I DON'T KNOW
Line_1759	I THINK IT REALATES TO THE LOST WHEN I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILLMENT IS BRAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT SEING
Line_1760	I THINK THE ELECTHA ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONES FILLAMENT BRAKES AND THEY'RE CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
Line_1761	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1762	UM I KNOW THAT UM
Line_1763	I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1764	UM I KNOW THAT UMIF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
Line_1765	I THINK THE BULB ISN'T LIT UP BECAUSE THE UM SWITCH IS THAT ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
Line_1766	IT SHINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MAYBE
Line_1767	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
Line_1768	WHANTEVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANY THING WITH IRON IN I
Line_1769	MAGNETS CAN ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
Line_1770	I THINK THAT THE FRINGE IS EITHER MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_1771	IT ORDER FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_1772	THEY OVER MAY LOT   STEEL OR IRON
Line_1773	THIT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL AND IT
Line_1774	THERE HAS TO BE A CERTION TIPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNET
Line_1775	STEEL OR IRON
Line_1776	THE STEEL ONE WILL STICK BECAUSE IT HAS ETHER'S FEUL OR IRON IN IT
Line_1777	I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET ARE EITHER MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1778	I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_1779	THE UM PAPER CLIP STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON

Line_1883	IT'S LIGHTING UP BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND YOU RN IT OFF THE LIGHT WON'TTURN
Line_1884	THEN YOU MA HAVE TO SWIH IT OUT I MEAN YOU WON'T THEN YOU DID IT RONG
Line_1885	IT WI'LL WEIHT UP
Line_1886	IT IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE IT BROKEN
Line_1887	THIT IT'S ILLED IT'S BROKEN
Line_1888	WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL CIRCLE GREEN WHEN IT'S PLK IT WILL CIRCL
Line_1889	IT BREAKES BECAUSE IT BEEN ON TO MNG PROBABLY
Line_1890	ONE LIGHT RAN OFF RGHN OUT AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHT
Line_1891	ITS ONE OF THEM ARE NOT ATTRACTIN
Line_1892	WELL STOP THE
Line_1893	IT'S ENERGY FOURCE
Line_1894	IT'S UM WHEN IT IS RAOUT
Line_1895	THIS CIRCUIT LIGHT CIRCUIT
Line_1896	THE ENERGY WILL STHAT
Line_1897	THE ENERGY WILL STOP
Line_1898	THE ENERGY WOULD STOFPP ON MIT
Line_1899	BECAUSE IT'S ENERGY
Line_1900	NOTHING HAPPLING
Line_1901	IT'S CAUSE ITS
Line_1902	ECAUSE IT THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS RAN OUT OF ENERGY
Line_1903	ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND RE
Line_1904	WHEN YOU DO NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL ATTRACT WHEN YOU DO SOUTH AND SOUTH TO GETHER THEY WON'T WR
Line_1905	THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON ONE SIDE AND THAT OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
Line_1906	IS WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
Line_1907	IT'S ATTRACTING TO THE FRI
Line_1908	THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO THE MA
Line_1909	IT'S BECAUSE IT HAS IRON AND SIDE IT SO
Line_1910	WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECT IT TO THE BLOCK IT WON'T ATTRACT BECAUSE AT'S IRON IN SIDE OF IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON A
Line_1911	UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_1912	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FOUND HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOS
Line_1913	ITOR HAS IRON AND THE MAGNET DUST IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1914	IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT'S WHY IT LOK
Line_1915	MAGNET STICK TO IRON
Line_1916	IT'S BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOESN' HAVE
Line_1917	BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN'T
Line_1918	THE ONE WITH IRON IN IT
Line_1919	THE NEL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS
Line_1920	IT WILL NOT STICK
Line_1921	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1922	NO METAL
Line_1923	IT WILL ATTRACT
Line_1924	IT ATTRACTS IT ATTRACTS
Line_1925	BECAUSE IT HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
Line_1926	IT DIN'
Line_1927	THAT ANIRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_1928	WE'VE  CREATING CIRRAUCIAT
Line_1929	THE D CELL IS IT A CERTAINACRITY THE RGIC CEYLL
Line_1930	BECAUSE WHE RK A THE WIRE ITSLO D L BOUT AANH ELECTRICITY AND HESLIKE IC OIN MAKE  THE RPID SHAER
Line_1931	THAT ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH
Line_1932	THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
Line_1933	A CALL HAS TO BE ASORLD TO CHWIRES TO GO WITH RY TO GO LAGLY ELECTRICITY TO GO INTO
Line_1934	IT'S NOT GOING TO GODEL BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT PRE OTHER CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLATTERY
Line_1935	OM METTAL  TI CHERCUAL TO THE IRON SOD AND IEOELECTRICIY TO GUET AL FROUGTIL
Line_1936	IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO HE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAGS AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCIUIT
Line_1937	ELECTRICITY WILLT GO THROU D CELL AND IT WILLT TURNEL THE FLAG
Line_1938	THE SWITCH HAS TOVE U
Line_1939	IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
Line_1940	WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING THE SO THEN IT IT WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES  THEN IT WILL WURN AND THE FLG BUN
Line_1941	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT LEITER
Line_1942	IT WOULD O'VE WORKED CUACPY CUNNY AND WHEY HOW THINK IT EER
Line_1943	ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES IND INTO THE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE COTRACTION AND THEN IT BAKES THE FLAY OLMER
Line_1944	THE FLAG MOVES
Line_1945	PRODUCERS ELECTRICITY MAKE HQUATEN
Line_1946	THE FLAG STOPS MOUVIN BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE WIDE ND IT DISN A HEAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEEN AND HE BARN
Line_1947	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
Line_1948	THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL IN THE WAITE TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOUVE
Line_1949	IT'S HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTHER AND MAKE ING FLAT TO
Line_1950	THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITC
Line_1951	THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WOLN'T MOVE THE FLAG
Line_1952	THE SWITCH PAS TME OFF
Line_1953	IT DOUSN'T WARNK
Line_1954	THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR STUCKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WEIGHT TO THE SELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
Line_1955	BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WOWN'T WORK
Line_1956	THEY WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SNEY
Line_1957	WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY IT STOPS WORKING
Line_1958	IT DOESN'TWOARK
Line_1959	IT WORKS
Line_1960	IT MAKES IT WORK
Line_1961	IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
Line_1962	IT'S CREATING A CTICUITS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
Line_1963	LETRICTRICITY
Line_1964	THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE MITAL IS TOUCHING
Line_1965	TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO A TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
Line_1966	THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR TO LIGHT UP
Line_1967	THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
Line_1968	HAS TO MAKE A PASS WHEN YOU CONNECTED IT
Line_1969	IT LIKE THE LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THE IT GOES UP AND THEN IT IT GOES BACK
Line_1970	IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO  LIGHT BULB
Line_1971	IT HAS HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
Line_1972	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_1973	THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULLB BACK INTO THE POSIT
Line_1974	NOW IT'S GOING THE WAY BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED ROUN IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPSIT WAY
Line_1975	THAT THERE IS ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH A LITTLE LIGHT BUB
Line_1976	THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA THE TWO BACES OF THE BULB IT DONT WOLDN'T WORBECAUSE THE WIRES PUSTO GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOLL WORK EASIER
Line_1977	I'M FINE WE'VE MET BEFORE
Line_1978	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOUVE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
Line_1979	IT'S FLOWING THROUGH A ELECTRICITY
Line_1980	HE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OPAY
Line_1981	YOUSE TO PUT A NEALL IN THER IT'S IT'S LIKE WEIYGH BETTER SO YEAH
Line_1982	WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
Line_1983	YEA I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WEO'VE MET BEFORE BUT THE I DONT WANNA MEAT YOU
Line_1984	ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
Line_1985	WCHING THIS ONE UM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SOYEAHR  NOA
Line_1986	IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S METAL
Line_1987	BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'SO MAKE IT IT WORK
Line_1988	METAL ITS SOMETHING IF SOMETHINGS METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLEETE A CONDUCTOR
Line_1989	IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
Line_1990	INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARVE THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
Line_1991	BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
Line_1992	ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
Line_1993	I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO W HAVE TO LUB
Line_1994	THEY'RE ALL AN THE LITLE MIG THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE THING
Line_1995	YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
Line_1996	MOTHER WAS A TIPE RIDER AND YOUR DADD WAS A SMART FOME
Line_1997	UM SALAID IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIXED
Line_1998	BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS AND YOUR FO
Line_1999	ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FUED MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
Line_2000	WATTER IS GOING INTO THE BULB BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYIND ON TOP ON THE FILT
Line_2001	WATER IS FILTERIN
Line_2002	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAED IN THE COFFY FILER
Line_2003	THE WATER IS FILTDURAIN
Line_2004	SOME THE SALT DISSOLVE
Line_2005	THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
Line_2006	SALT WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
Line_2007	WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
Line_2008	MIXTURES IS WHET YOU MICK SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
Line_2009	MY WIFE JUST DIED AGAIN
Line_2010	SOIUL PRGE EX
Line_2011	IT WAS CALLED SOIOL
Line_2012	IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE ARYA
Line_2013	THEY SAID THAT THAUT THERE WERE THERE IS THE  THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOITL
Line_2014	THERE IS HOMIS GRAVEL CLAY AND SEALT IN IT
Line_2015	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
Line_2016	UMIS GRAPFLE CLAY AND CELT
Line_2017	HUHMIS GRAVELE CLAY AND SELT
Line_2018	I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAIN AND FARMLANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARVIN
Line_2019	DILTA HAS SOME VERY VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDL
Line_2020	THERE IS TAE WAT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL AND THAT THIN BECAUSE IT HAS CILT CLAY HUMMES GRAVEL AND THAT'S DUFF
Line_2021	THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
Line_2022	IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUMA SGRAPFUL CLAINS CILT AND THIS SOIL
Line_2023	ALL THE OTHER CIS WITH PUMPED UP KIT
Line_2024	I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A WD OF PLANT LIFE LIKE CADI AND CACKDI AND BOUSHES AND MOR CACKDI
Line_2025	IT HAS A LOT MORE SANDS THEN THOS
Line_2026	GOEND BY
Line_2027	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLU
Line_2028	THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN THEND YOU CANT REALLY SEE IT IS SOLID ANYMORE
Line_2029	UM IT'S PLAIN ONE OF THE MIX
Line_2030	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEETE THAT
Line_2031	THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT EBSOLVE DE VUL DISSOLVES IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
Line_2032	IT'S BEAN IT'S BULLBD O PLAT AND THAN IT'S BEAN BIGEAHE
Line_2033	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEETE THAT
Line_2034	IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTON
Line_2035	YEIN S
Line_2036	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2037	'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2038	IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUT
Line_2039	I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
Line_2040	I FORGOT THE WR
Line_2041	BECAUSE THE WATER IS LIKE FLOWTING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2042	WEL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
Line_2043	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLID
Line_2044	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPEARE
Line_2045	TIME LOTS OF LOTS OF TIME
Line_2046	SOLUTIONS
Line_2047	A SOLT OVEIN
Line_2048	THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER LIKE A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
Line_2049	THAT THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
Line_2050	THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE A SOUTIONT A MIXTUE
Line_2051	GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
Line_2052	THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER IT WILL
Line_2053	THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
Line_2054	I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT A SOLUTION
Line_2055	THE FLOWER MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
Line_2056	SOLUTION
Line_2057	THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFY FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
Line_2058	IT'S A MIXTURE
Line_2059	THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FIL FILTERED OUT
Line_2060	YES YES YOU CAN
Line_2061	THE SALT IS DISOLVING BEBECAUSE SOME MIX
Line_2062	BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
Line_2063	IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO A SKY OR
Line_2064	IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPOR
Line_2065	CAN WE PLEASE GO ON
Line_2066	THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMET OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
Line_2067	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION
Line_2068	SPONS ARE FLOWTING
Line_2069	E
Line_2070	WHEN IT WAS WEIGHED HIGHER AND IT WAS HEAVIER
Line_2071	EITHER IT'S SWEETER OR BITTER
Line_2072	THEY ARE GOING TO BE HARD SWEETER
Line_2073	THEY LOOK SWEETER AND THEY LOOK DENSER
Line_2074	THEY ARE DILUTED
Line_2075	LESS POWDER OR MORE WATER
Line_2076	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
Line_2077	YOU COULD WATER OR TAKE WATER AWAY
Line_2078	YOU COULD ETHER TAKE OUT FIFUM FIFTY MILLILITERS OF OR OF WATER OR ADD FIFTY MILLILITERS OF W
Line_2079	THE AMOUNT OF WATER WILL MAKE IT U MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2080	BY DICKING OUT WATER
Line_2081	BLAWLBLAW OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
Line_2082	ONES A TASTER AND ONES  OBSERVED
Line_2083	WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON THA SCAIL
Line_2084	ONES TEN GRA TEN GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2085	ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
Line_2086	BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
Line_2087	IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
Line_2088	THEY'RE ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT
Line_2089	THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2090	SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
Line_2091	DILUTION ONE AND SOLUTION TWO
Line_2092	WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
Line_2093	THE DENCITY HAS IS UM THE CORK IS LIGHTER THAN THE PENY AND SO IT FLOWS
Line_2094	THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLOW
Line_2095	IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS
Line_2096	BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
Line_2097	IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD FLOW
Line_2098	THEY WON'T MIX BUT THEN WITH OTHERS THEY MIGHT MIX
Line_2099	THEY PUT SOLUTION A M FIRST AND THEN SOLUTION B AND THEN IT MIXED  GOT BACK
Line_2100	BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THROUGH EACH OTHER
Line_2101	IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
Line_2102	IT HAS SIX MORE GRAM IT HAS SIX MORE GRAMS THAN THE RED AND TEN MORE GRAMS THAN THE GREEN
Line_2103	THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIX
Line_2104	BY THE BULBYE
Line_2105	WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOLUTIONS AND
Line_2106	WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
Line_2107	WTHEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER
Line_2108	ONE SHOGER AND ONE A CITRIC ASID
Line_2109	BECAUSE UM IT
Line_2110	MOUNT PAR
Line_2111	SAME CHAR AND OUR SCIENCE NOT BOKS
Line_2112	BECAUSE IT HAS THIRTY SIX GRAMS
Line_2113	SUBSTANCE ONE I SAID
Line_2114	SOME ARE FLAT SOME ARE SPIKY SOME ARE SIK
Line_2115	IT'S SALT
Line_2116	IT SALT
Line_2117	IT'S BIKE
Line_2118	SAYE I HOT AGAN SAD WO WHAT W YEAH YEAH HOW MY DOU DOM MADU
Line_2119	EPSOM SALT
Line_2120	EPSOM SALT
Line_2121	EPSOM SALT I'VE SAID THAT LIKE TWENTY TIMES NOW
Line_2122	EVE VEEN DOING PRODUCTS AND REACTIONS
Line_2123	THEY'RE PRODUCTS NO THEY'RE REACTANT AND THEY REACT OFF EACH OTHER TO MAKE A PRODUCT
Line_2124	THERE IS CCITRIC ACID BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLIDE
Line_2125	SOLVENT SOLUTES
Line_2126	YOH BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ADD WATER TO MAKE IT A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2127	IT'S TWO
Line_2128	THEY'RE FARTHER AWAY AND THEN THE REACTANTS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER
Line_2129	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUME I NOTHING DRUM SOME
Line_2130	ING SODAY I CALCIMUM CHLARINE ACH TO  OEB
Line_2131	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2132	IT S A PRECIPITATES
Line_2133	NO BECAUSE THEY'E ARE A MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2134	NO THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING JUST ICE GETTING PUT IN IN THE GLASS AND THE GLASS IS SWEATTING
Line_2135	THE WATER IS CHANGING COLOR
Line_2136	IT'S PITTY AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S
Line_2137	IT HAS UMBUBBLED AND
Line_2138	IT FIZED AND I DON'T KNOW WHI
Line_2139	THE GREEN LIQUID IS TRYING THE GREEN
Line_2140	THE GRE
Line_2141	YEAH
Line_2142	THE FIRST CAN HAS SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE HAS NOT AT AL
Line_2143	IF A PRODUCT IS LEFT
Line_2144	IF IT WOULD FIXE OR IF IT TURND HOT OR COLD
Line_2145	CALCIOM CLORED WATER AND SOMETHING ELSE
Line_2146	THEY WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY ETHER BLUE UP THE BAG AND THIT FIZED
Line_2147	THERE IS GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2148	GASS LIQUID AND SOLID
Line_2149	WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
Line_2150	THAT SCIENCES WREARED
Line_2151	THERE IS A CAMICAL REACTION ON SCAIL AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE  THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE HAS MORE SOLID
Line_2152	I MOWKKI I HOW WELLE I DON'T EN HR AND ABOUT HE JALLAR
Line_2153	FROM WATER THE YEALE
Line_2154	SOIL WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOIL
Line_2155	ITS THERE'S HUIMISE GRAVEL CLAY AND SO
Line_2156	THEY ARE MIXING TOGETHER AND THERE IS LIKE A CHOPPING A SEA
Line_2157	WELL FOIRST VALLOU SHOK IT UP SO IT IT'S GOING TO MIX TOGETHER ANDTHEN IT'SGOING TO SETAL AND IT'S GOING O TURN DIFFERENT
Line_2158	THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES SOIL
Line_2159	THEY ARE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
Line_2160	THATW'S MY FRIENDY SO SMART
Line_2161	ALL OF THESE UM ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SOYEU
Line_2162	THEY ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP UP OF THE SAME THING
Line_2163	THAT THERE IS A MAGNEFYING ON THE BOTTOM ANDA SCREEN
Line_2164	THEYARE DIFFERENT AND THE MOST DENSE ONES ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND THE LEAST DENSE ONES R WN
Line_2165	NOW FUN
Line_2166	THEY ALL HAVE PROPERTYES OR SHOW IT AND THAT ALL
Line_2167	WE'RE A LONE AND MEMRTER AT THE BOTTOM UH YOU CAN NOT COMMANOR
Line_2168	OR THE MOUNTANS OR THE FOMLAN OR THE DO
Line_2169	THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
Line_2170	A BYE BBYE BY THE A
Line_2171	WIND WATER YEAH
Line_2172	ONCE IT FILL T THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STOWN AND THEN IT STARTED WETHERING BY THE WATER
Line_2173	IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIF BROK TWO THEN HIT A CUP OF ROCKS AND THEN SPLASSHED INTO THE WATE
Line_2174	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2175	THEY WERE IN THE RIVERIL TUN AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEY JUST GOT A ROATED UNTO
Line_2176	THE BULDERS ARE THE BIGEST THE
Line_2177	THEL'S TO GRAVEL
Line_2178	BECAUSE THE DELGRAVL HASBEEND IN THEIR WAYH MORE THAN THE BULDERS HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING PAMMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWN STREEN
Line_2179	FLOUE ANYBODY THERE MEITS ALE MADE IT ALL
Line_2180	I'M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
Line_2181	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHERING CABMICAL WETHERING FHYSICAL WETHERING ABOUT VINEGAR HOW IT CAN CHANGE ROPCKS
Line_2182	LET'S GO COME ON DO YOU L
Line_2183	THERE IS WATER ASSIDRAN THAT'S HITTING THE LIMESTON AND DICINIGRATING
Line_2184	WHAT IS HWHAT IS THAH WHAT IS THAT WHENE IS
Line_2185	IT'S IT'S A ASID RAINE IS COMING DOWN A SHAFTING IT AND MAKING A TUNNEL THROUGH THE LG
Line_2186	RAIN AND PRECI
Line_2187	THE WROCKS HAVE TURNED BROWN AND IT TOOK TIME
Line_2188	WITH THE SANDSTON THE RAIN FREES DOES NOT DOES NOT DO HUGE DAMEAGE
Line_2189	THAT THE LIME STON AVFTER ASIGRAIN AVFTER A YEAR STILL HAD
Line_2190	IT DISSOLVED
Line_2191	HA NO ANYBODY THERE
Line_2192	IT UPBRIGED AND A ROTED
Line_2193	ASIDRAIN AND ALSO AROSION
Line_2194	THERE ARE CUT BANKS AND LITTLE RIVERS DOWN THE ROCK
Line_2195	THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE I SEE A CUPANK
Line_2196	IT'S WHAT'S LEFT AFTER TWO THINGS KILLIDE
Line_2197	THERE ARE LITTLE ILANDS
Line_2198	DEPOSITION

Line_2210	DULTA DEPOSITION
Line_2211	WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EXACT SANM THING AND WE'VE BEEN DOING STREEM TABLE
Line_2212	IT DIFFERS BECAUSE ONE IS UM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE IS NOT EVIN CLOSED TO THE BOT
Line_2213	THAT FLAT IS MIEANDERING AND THEN STEEP IS JUST GOING STRAGHT DOWN
Line_2214	THE STEEP SLOPE IS GOING VERY FLAT FAST AND THEN THE FLAT SLOPE IS GOING VERY SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AROUND CORNERS
Line_2215	FLUD WILL GO MUCH MORE BECAUSE
Line_2216	ONE IS VERY DEPOSITED AND ONE IS NOT
Line_2217	THE WATER HAS GON OUT
Line_2218	IT'S HIR IND THE FLOUOD

Line_2231	WE USED THEM
Line_2232	MINERALS GO IN TO ROCKS BUT ROCKS DON'T GO INTO MIENNALAR
Line_2233	THIS IS A SCAILE TO SEE HOW HARD WHAT AR WE DID THIS IN CLAS
Line_2234	NOTHING HAPENS HERE GOES THE NAIL
Line_2235	NO BUT THE DIMEAN CAN
Line_2236	IT MADE A MARK WHY DOES IT ALWAYS MAKE A MARK
Line_2237	IT DOESN'T
Line_2238	NOTHING
Line_2239	I KNOW TH AR HI IS

Line_2241	LEDOIN MARBLS
Line_2242	ROCK AND SCRATCH THE TILE YOUH
Line_2243	IT HAVED P
Line_2244	YOU ARE MIXING A LIQUID WITH A SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2245	I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS MIXTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU GET A SOLUTION
Line_2246	THEAT
Line_2247	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2248	THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GREAPE TA STICK
Line_2249	SOLUTE IS THE SOLT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE WAL
Line_2250	THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
Line_2251	WE SAY THAT IT DOESN'T LOUSE ANY WAIGHT IT JUST AD
Line_2252	IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHAN
Line_2253	FIRST THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2254	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT ITS STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOUSE ANY WEIGHT
Line_2255	I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGT OF THE SALT YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION AND THE A
Line_2256	YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
Line_2257	I THINK THAT THIS IS A SO
Line_2258	I NOTICED THAT THE SALT BEEN COT AN THE COFFY FILLED
Line_2259	I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2260	I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A MIXK
Line_2261	I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ASID DID NOT GET CAUT IN THE SUT
Line_2262	THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPR
Line_2263	I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPER AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND AND THE CON
Line_2264	THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES THE LONG
Line_2265	THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE FETHE
Line_2266	I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_2267	I SHING THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
Line_2268	I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT
Line_2269	THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAVS TWICE AS MUCH SOUTE AS THE
Line_2270	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
Line_2271	I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTR
Line_2272	TUT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRAT
Line_2273	MEAN PHIE
Line_2274	THE PENY IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE CORT
Line_2275	THE PENY WEIGHS MORE
Line_2276	IF IT'S LESS DENSE IT WILL FLOW MORE
Line_2277	THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAT THAN SOLUTION
Line_2278	SOLUTION B IS MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2279	IF IT IS MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS DENSEER
Line_2280	MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DENSE THAN LESS CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS
Line_2281	CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS FLOWED ON THE TOP
Line_2282	THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE TOP AND THE MORE CONCENTRATED ONE WILL GO ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2283	THE LIGHTER IF WE AD THE LIGHTER SALT SOLUTION LAST THEN IT WILL THEN IT WILL JUST STAY ON T
Line_2284	IT ARE MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE SOLUTION B IS TRYING TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2285	AUSE ONE OF THEM HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2286	THAT'S SO
Line_2287	A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE
Line_2288	THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2289	THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER
Line_2290	INS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2291	THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTESOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2292	SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALTS INTO THE E TO LO
Line_2293	WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SHOOGER
Line_2294	SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
Line_2295	THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS CONCENTRATED THEN THE FIFTY METERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHTS
Line_2296	THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT AND THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS
Line_2297	THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGHT THE SAM
Line_2298	THEY HAVE TO DO WITH UM
Line_2299	I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH EPSOM SALT AND WITH
Line_2300	THE MASS PIECES ARE SHOWING US HOW MUCH ITS SOLUTION WEIGHS
Line_2301	IT MEANS THAT SOME OF THE SOLUTE WAS
Line_2302	I GET YOU THAT
Line_2303	THEY SEATURATED THE WATER
Line_2304	I THINK THAT IT'S EPSOM
Line_2305	IT WN'T DO SCIENCE TODAY
Line_2306	YOU ARE MIXING TO REACTANTS TO GET A PRODUCT
Line_2307	THERE IS BAKING SODA CITRIC ACID AND CALCIUM CHLORI
Line_2308	SOLVENT AND SOLUT
Line_2309	THEY'RE LIKE
Line_2310	I NOTICE THAT THE MOLECLULES AREWE
Line_2311	THEY LOOK DIFFEREN
Line_2312	IT MEANS IT MEANS THAT UM IT MEANS THAT
Line_2313	THERE ARE VALLYOUTHINGS
Line_2314	THERE IS PERIE CIPIT THERE IS A PRECIPITATE LEFT OVER
Line_2315	YOU MIXED SODIUM HIDROCK SIDE WATER AND HIDROLICCORIC

Line_2317	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2318	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2319	THAT THE THINGS ARE ESCKEW
Line_2320	UM THERE ARE BUOVES
Line_2321	I SAW THE PRODUCT OF FIZING AND THEN IT SETTALED DOWN
Line_2322	IT'S GETTING RAINED ON AND SNOWED ON AND IT'S GETTING RUSTY
Line_2323	THE BGH GOT RUSTY SO THAT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2324	THE REST ON THE BIKE AND THEN N
Line_2325	THE GLOWE STICK STARTED GLOWING
Line_2326	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2327	THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MADE FIZ A LOAUGT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T FILL
Line_2328	IN THE FIRST MIXTURE THAT IS SHOWN THE SOLUTION FISITS AND HAS A PRECIPITATE
Line_2329	YOU MADE EICE THREE OH
Line_2330	THAT BOTH THAT DOS DE
Line_2331	I DON'T KNOW
Line_2332	THE CONSTANTRATION OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2333	THEY'RE MOLECLULES LIKE DI
Line_2334	THERE ARE THREE LIGHERS IN THE BAG
Line_2335	A PRODUCT A LIQUID AND THE GASS
Line_2336	CULCIUM CHLORIDE IND BAKING SODA
Line_2337	A SOLID ALIQUID AND A GA
Line_2338	IT TELLS US THAT THE

Line_2502	AM DOGAN UTHOW WELE SOUPPOSE TO
Line_2503	OH THAT THEY THEYR ARE TWO SOFFT
Line_2504	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REPLECS OFF  THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
Line_2505	THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
Line_2506	I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
Line_2507	WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THEM
Line_2508	THE LIGHT REAYS ARE BAOLONCING OFF EVERY THING AND UAND HAWAY
Line_2509	REFLECTION
Line_2510	IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
Line_2511	THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STARE BY BOUNCING OFF VALDMETERS
Line_2512	IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT IND THE MIDDL
Line_2513	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
Line_2514	THEY ARE ALL WLIGHT LIGHTS
Line_2515	IT'S WEIGHT
Line_2516	EVERYWEARE
Line_2517	A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
Line_2518	THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISUM AND THEN THE PRISUM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
Line_2519	WHEN THE LIGHT FIRST FLACKS OFF THE BLUE BULB THE LIGHT BEBECOMES BLUE
Line_2520	THE REA HITTING TEVULT IS SWIGHT AND THE RASE COMING OFF THE BULB ARE BLUG
Line_2521	I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING OBSORBED BY THE BLUE BUAL
Line_2522	I THINK THE BLUE BULB IS REFLECT IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOU
Line_2523	THE WEIGHT IS HITTING THE BULB AND THEN THE
Line_2524	I THINK IT GETS OBSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BULL
Line_2525	THE BULB IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLU LIGHT
Line_2526	THE OBJECTS APPEARE TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT LIGHT THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
Line_2527	I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHEIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
Line_2528	IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
Line_2529	HUNGRE
Line_2530	THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
Line_2531	THE ONES BEHIND IT BERN OUT
Line_2532	THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TWO
Line_2533	THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
Line_2534	THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
Line_2535	THEY THEY GO OUT TO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
Line_2536	THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WERK
Line_2537	AS THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
Line_2538	IT IS THE BYES FEER

Line_2545	THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE RODUCED
Line_2546	IT MEANTHAT YOU EA OTHER THINGS TOGET
Line_2547	ANIMALES EAT OTHER ANIMALES AND PLANS TO GET THEAIR ENERGY
Line_2548	THEY CAN CEEL THE ENERGY TO GETHER
Line_2549	WE GET THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD PUNCE AND ANIMALES THEY D CAN'T

Line_2560	THEY TURNS INTO DARK
Line_2561	THE ENVIRONMENT
Line_2562	WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
Line_2563	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES SAND AND WATER AND MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2564	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2565	THE WATER IS PLAING THE SOLUTION
Line_2566	SOMETHING LIKE SAL
Line_2567	THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
Line_2568	THE SOLID AND THE MIXTURE IS THE WATER
Line_2569	THE SALT DOES THE DISSOLV IN
Line_2570	THE MIXED AND RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PEANOTS REASONS AND EMINIM
Line_2571	THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
Line_2572	IT SHOWES THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2573	IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2574	IT IS BEING ADDED
Line_2575	THE ANIMATION SHOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
Line_2576	THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2577	A MIX DRAWR
Line_2578	BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
Line_2579	I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
Line_2580	YOU CAN FILL DRWOUT A SOLUTE AND A A SOLUTION
Line_2581	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SOW ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
Line_2582	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2583	THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WE NO IT'S A SOLUTION SORY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2584	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
Line_2585	WHEN THE POWDER IS MIXED WITH THE WATER GREAP CASTICK IS BEING MADE AND THE POWDER IS DISSOLVING
Line_2586	THE WATER AND A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
Line_2587	CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLLUTE
Line_2588	IN CLASS WE USED A SCAL TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO C
Line_2589	THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
Line_2590	BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
Line_2591	THIT WOULD TAKE SHIGARREER AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIRER CONCENTRATION
Line_2592	I HAVE NO I DEEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO
Line_2593	THE TAST IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESSWIL
Line_2594	THE CONCENTRATION WOLL BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
Line_2595	YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE CUP
Line_2596	WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COLDE BY HOW MUCH WATERS IN THE COLDE
Line_2597	I AM HAVING A BAD DAY MARNEY
Line_2598	I FORGET WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SCIENCE
Line_2599	I THINK A TIPE OF GASS WAS CREATED
Line_2600	I THINK SEE O TWO WAS SUM CREATED
Line_2601	CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2602	THE SCIENTIFIC TRRON IS PRODUCT
Line_2603	THE ONE TO THE LEFT CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDL IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CCALCIUM CLORIDE
Line_2604	WE CALLE THESE REACTION
Line_2605	WE CALLED THEM REACTENTS
Line_2606	I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBLY BE
Line_2607	I THINK THE BUBBLING AND WA WATER IS MISSING
Line_2608	WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THINGS MOLLECLULS
Line_2609	SOME OF THE MULECLULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE THE SE
Line_2610	SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APPART
Line_2611	THE REACTEIND MULECLULS LOOK LIKE THE PROD MOLECLUL
Line_2612	RIPEE PLEASED
Line_2613	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2614	BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
Line_2615	THERE IS SOME OF EACH TIYPE  MOLECUL AND HA SOLUTION
Line_2616	THE WATER IS GAINING AT MOLLECULES FROM THE HIDROALICK ASID
Line_2617	THE WATER GLASS GOT FAGH YE
Line_2618	TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAR AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
Line_2619	NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVES INTO EACH OTHER
Line_2620	A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FILED UP AND THEN CALLM DOWN
Line_2621	THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SERIT PRODUCT
Line_2622	NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE I NO THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FEEL
Line_2623	THERE IS A CEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS HADDED ON TO THE PAINT RUST IS FORMED
Line_2624	NO THERE IS NOT
Line_2625	BY MARNEY I HAD A LOT OF FIND MAKING SANDWUAGES RIDING ON UNICINS AND PLAYING MAR
Line_2626	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2627	THE SALID IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
Line_2628	ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
Line_2629	ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
Line_2630	TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
Line_2631	THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
Line_2632	BEING SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
Line_2633	THE WATER WENT THROUGHE THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYIED ON THE TOP
Line_2634	OR BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
Line_2635	THE THIM SHEAIR IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
Line_2636	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WA
Line_2637	THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DOES
Line_2638	VALLED MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2639	THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2640	WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AN WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2641	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE WA
Line_2642	UM I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
Line_2643	UH PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEETE THAT
Line_2644	WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
Line_2645	UM I'M JUST GUESSING BUT UM IS IT A QUEVOLENT SEE
Line_2646	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY E PROPERTY OF IT
Line_2647	THE EPSOM SALTWAS FILTERED ERBULE
Line_2648	THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
Line_2649	ONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNE
Line_2650	THAT'S TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
Line_2651	THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CECTRIC ASID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2652	I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2653	THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
Line_2654	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
Line_2655	E GOLD BYE YOU'RE MY BEST S FRIEND
Line_2656	WHAT YOU WONE NA TALK ABOUT MARNEY I DON'T REALLY GET IT
Line_2657	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICAL SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
Line_2658	WE CALL THEM TOOLS THAT WE USED TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS AND NOT REALLY SURE MARNEY I'M BADD IT'S SIENCE
Line_2659	I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BT
Line_2660	WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MAGNET
Line_2661	I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
Line_2662	IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
Line_2663	OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2664	WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
Line_2665	WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2666	UM ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS AL MORE GRIP TASTIC POWDER IN IT
Line_2667	WELL MARNEY THE  DARK COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
Line_2668	I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
Line_2669	THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
Line_2670	IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAST REALLY GROWES AND JUST REALLY DISCUSING AND YEAH THUT'S REALLY YOU DAH REALLY GROWS
Line_2671	IT'S PROBABLY GONG TO TASTE PRITTY BLAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT IT MIGHT TAST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
Line_2672	IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLAND AND A LOT MORE TASTLESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
Line_2673	I'M GREIT MARNY HOW ARE YOU I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
Line_2674	ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
Line_2675	I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU UM KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
Line_2676	THE SALT WILL YOU YOU CAN UNLESS YOU TAST IT
Line_2677	ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDL
Line_2678	WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
Line_2679	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2680	THESE SOLIDS AND IT SHARE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2681	THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
Line_2682	MAGNETISM AND A SEE
Line_2683	BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2684	THE PAPER CLIPS STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZE
Line_2685	TO TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
Line_2686	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SEE AND THE STONS STICKED ON TOP
Line_2687	I THINK WE USED THE SEE BECAUSE THE WATER GOS SHIGHER THAN THE HOLDS AND THE STEE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
Line_2688	THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFY FILTER AND THE SAND STAIED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFY FIL
Line_2689	BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS TRO THE FILTER
Line_2690	THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE SEPALART THAT SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
Line_2691	YOUE ARE PUTTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
Line_2692	TO DAY MARNEY WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTE A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
Line_2693	ONE HAS MORE UM SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
Line_2694	MY PRODICTION WAS RIGHT MARNEY BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLITES SOLUTION
Line_2695	WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S HOW HI UP
Line_2696	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2697	SEE IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATE
Line_2698	I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
Line_2699	THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SIENCE
Line_2700	THE PENY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORT
Line_2701	THE CORK IS LESS DENCE THAND THE PENY
Line_2702	IT WILL FLOW
Line_2703	UM OKAY A MUNG CRECHES BUT I'M GOOD
Line_2704	THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
Line_2705	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
Line_2706	I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTION IS
Line_2707	THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
Line_2708	THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
Line_2709	THEY ARE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND IT IS SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
Line_2710	SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTO
Line_2711	THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
Line_2712	WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
Line_2713	BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
Line_2714	THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE S EACH OTHR
Line_2715	WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2716	WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
Line_2717	I THINK IT MEANS THAT I'M NOT SHURE
Line_2718	THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WELL WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
Line_2719	THAT MEANS IT SATURATED
Line_2720	THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2721	THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
Line_2722	IT'S BECOMING SATURATED
Line_2723	IT BECOMES SATURATED
Line_2724	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
Line_2725	WE FIGURED THE SOULT BY WEIGH
Line_2726	THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATE
Line_2727	THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_2728	BECAUSE THE CITRIC ASID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SHOGER  MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
Line_2729	THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGHS SOLUTION
Line_2730	I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAN
Line_2731	SUBSTANCE S IS SALT I MEAN YEAH
Line_2732	SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
Line_2733	THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WIGHT CRYSTL
Line_2734	UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
Line_2735	EPSUM SALT
Line_2736	I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ASID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
Line_2737	I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
Line_2738	WELL WE'VE JUST CINE AVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOILUTIONS AND MIXTURES
Line_2739	A CEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
Line_2740	CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2741	REACTENTS
Line_2742	WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
Line_2743	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT W'E BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
Line_2744	I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTNT
Line_2745	SOLVENT
Line_2746	I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS LOS OF WEARED STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
Line_2747	THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAS
Line_2748	IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GASS
Line_2749	IT TURNS INTO A GAS
Line_2750	THEY LOOK VERYFOLMY
Line_2751	IT MEANS THAT THEY WEARE BOTH COMBINED
Line_2752	THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MAKE BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLORIDE WITH WATER
Line_2753	IT BUBLED UP AND FIS A LAWT
Line_2754	THERE IS SOME LITTLE WHIGHT STUFF ON THE  BOTTOM
Line_2755	THEY'RE MISSING SODIUM HIDRAWCK SIDE WITH HIGH DRAWPT
Line_2756	UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECILES WE ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A LITTLE A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPL
Line_2757	ITS  UM THEYRE A MIXED OF ALL OF THE REACTENTS
Line_2758	NO THEY CANT BECAUSE NOW THEIR PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CEMICAL REACTHING
Line_2759	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PINK
Line_2760	THE FINAL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
Line_2761	ON SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
Line_2762	THERE IS DEFEINEATELY A REACTION HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE IT'S BUBLING AND FISING
Line_2763	THE WAL THE BUBLES AND THE CARBON IN WATER ARE CARVON BUB
Line_2764	ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
Line_2765	IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOKING INTO IT'S BONES
Line_2766	THERE IS NO CEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THING IS REACTING IT'S JUST ROSI
Line_2767	ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPANING TO THE BIKE
Line_2768	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING IT TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT IT ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOWS
Line_2769	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
Line_2770	THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
Line_2771	THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
Line_2772	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBLING OR
Line_2773	A CHEMICAL REACTION ACCURED
Line_2774	THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION O
Line_2775	THIS TELLS US WHAT THE EVENTRAL MASS IS
Line_2776	YEAH THIS TELLS US THAT
Line_2777	I'M REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARNEY
Line_2778	WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2779	CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNEY
Line_2780	MIXTURES
Line_2781	THE TRAIL MAKES THE THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE CHENETS THE RASONS AND THE EMINEMS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
Line_2782	IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUP
Line_2783	THE PENETS RAISONS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILES
Line_2784	THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2785	WHAT HAPPENDS MARNEY IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISCINIGRATES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT JUST CLEAR SO YEAH DT
Line_2786	THE SOLUTION
Line_2787	SOLUTE
Line_2788	A SOLUTE
Line_2789	WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S EARLLY IN THE WATER AND IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
Line_2790	I MARNEY I ALOT OF FUN WITH YOU GOOD BYE ILL SEE OU IN YOUR WORST EERS
Line_2791	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2792	A SOLUTION
Line_2793	WELL THE SALT IS GOTTING MIXE INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
Line_2794	THE SALT DISSOLVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2795	THE SOLVENT
Line_2796	IT PLA'S AS SOLVENT OUH YEA OH YEAH YEAH I YESS I DID
Line_2797	ESORRIMARNE HAVE TO GO CAOS YOU LEAITER BYE
Line_2798	I'M DOING GREAIHT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU DOING
Line_2799	WELL WE'ARE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
Line_2800	WELL MARNEY YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
Line_2801	WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TWOOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
Line_2802	WELL MARNEY THE FAN IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCK SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOUS
Line_2803	IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBLES ARENT BIG ENOUGH TO SET THROUGH THE FAN
Line_2804	BEECAUSE IT'S BIGER THAN THE HOLES
Line_2805	THE IMPORTANTENT PROPERTY IS PEBLES ARE GETING STUCK IND TAN FAN CAY MARNEY
Line_2806	THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPERCLIPS
Line_2807	SCREEN
Line_2808	SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBLES THE SMALLER PEBLES
Line_2809	YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THEN WILTL TAKE A WILE
Line_2810	BECAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GOING TO WORK UN TO THIS
Line_2811	I NOTICE THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ONTO THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2812	SO THAT IT WO'S BACK THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_2813	I REALLISED THAT THE PEBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREEN
Line_2814	YOU USE A STEEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBLES
Line_2815	SAW WHAT HAPPEND WAS UM THE THE LITTLE PEBLES GOT STUCK AND THE FILTER
Line_2816	SO THAT IT'LL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
Line_2817	VALPAR  SHEUN
Line_2818	IT'S A MIXTURE MARNE
Line_2819	GOOD HOW ARE YOU AN
Line_2820	MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2821	WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT REASOURCES
Line_2822	WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GREAP TAXTICK POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2823	UA MIXTURE
Line_2824	WELL ONE IS GOING TO BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_2825	THE ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAE  MUCH POWDER
Line_2826	IT HAD MORE FLAVER
Line_2827	ONE WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
Line_2828	IT HAS LESS POWDER
Line_2829	IT HAS MORE WATER
Line_2830	SWEEATER AND HEAVIER
Line_2831	IT WOULD CHACE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRAPIER
Line_2832	MORE GREAP TASTICK
Line_2833	MARNEY I NEVER WANT TA SEE YOU AGAIN O KAY BIE
Line_2834	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_2835	THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RESIDY
Line_2836	THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRICK ASID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SHOGER
Line_2837	WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPEINING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SCAIL
Line_2838	SUBSTANCE THE IS TWELVE GRAMS
Line_2839	THEY ARE ICE CRYSTALS THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2840	I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
Line_2841	YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHAR
Line_2842	YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRIYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
Line_2843	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2844	IN THE PIXTURE IT SHOWES THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2845	YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
Line_2846	I CAN IDENTIFYE SALID BEANS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2847	GREEN RED PEURPLE BLUE
Line_2848	THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
Line_2849	THE TRAIL MAKES SEPARATE AND TO DIFFERENT
Line_2850	THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2851	WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
Line_2852	THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATE GROUPS
Line_2853	THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
Line_2854	THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
Line_2855	IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLE
Line_2856	WHAT HAPPEND IS IT RUNT BACK TOGETHER AND IT  IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
Line_2857	THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
Line_2858	ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
Line_2859	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2860	YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
Line_2861	YOU ARE MIXING THE SALTS WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
Line_2862	WE CALLE THEM A SOLUTE
Line_2863	THE SRON STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
Line_2864	THE SALT DISSOLVED
Line_2865	THE ROLE THE WATER IS FLOWING AND THIS PMIXTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
Line_2866	I DON'T KNOW I'MS SORY
Line_2867	WHAT THE SOLUTE ROULES PLACE AND THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
Line_2868	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
Line_2869	THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
Line_2870	ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
Line_2871	WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WEIGH MORE
Line_2872	IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
Line_2873	THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
Line_2874	WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST AD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE MI
Line_2875	THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
Line_2876	THE MASS HAS BECOME GREAITER
Line_2877	A MIX
Line_2878	THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
Line_2879	CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MAN
Line_2880	CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MAN
Line_2881	IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
Line_2882	EXCUSE ME MAM BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
Line_2883	WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWIN AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO AN I UH SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2884	HORIBLE TO DAY THINGS FOR ASKING
Line_2885	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
Line_2886	THE GRAP DRINK IS A MIXED AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
Line_2887	BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
Line_2888	THE ROCK WEIGHS NINEDY GRAMS AND THE FETHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
Line_2889	CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
Line_2890	WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAIY
Line_2891	I DID WELL IN MY PRODICTION MY PRODICTION WAS CORRECT
Line_2892	BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
Line_2893	I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2894	THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2895	I'M SORRY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
Line_2896	I BELIEVE NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRAT
Line_2897	I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOT THTHE LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
Line_2898	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
Line_2899	HOW YOU CAN DETERMIN IS BY TASTING THE
Line_2900	WE ARE SEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
Line_2901	THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
Line_2902	BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
Line_2903	THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME MOUNT AMOUNT OF WATER
Line_2904	THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
Line_2905	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2906	NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED IN NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2907	SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
Line_2908	WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASIS
Line_2909	YOU IDENTIFIED THE CRYSTALS
Line_2910	YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUBSNTS
Line_2911	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLED
Line_2912	I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
Line_2913	YOU MIX TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_2914	THEY ARE MAKING A CEMICAL REACTION
Line_2915	I SEE A REACTION
Line_2916	YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CEMICALS THING
Line_2917	IT'S A MADITION PROBLUM
Line_2918	UI DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
Line_2919	THE BAG CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
Line_2920	ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MORE
Line_2921	BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNEW THAT QUESTION OPS THE WA
Line_2922	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURE
Line_2923	THIS IS A MIXTURE WHE ARE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
Line_2924	THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2925	I SEE A SALAD NEUTS AND WATER
Line_2926	THE SALAD IS CREEN
Line_2927	THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
Line_2928	IT'S CALLED A MIXTUREA AND IT'S REAL TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
Line_2929	THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE THOUG TWO ALL MIXTURE
Line_2930	THEY WE'RE TAKING RASONS AND IMMINNIMS OUT OF THE NEUTS
Line_2931	THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY
Line_2932	THEY ARE BRINGING MIXED TOGETHER
Line_2933	THEY ARE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATELE
Line_2934	THEY ARE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
Line_2935	THE WATTEL GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTUR
Line_2936	THE SANDS STAIED ON TOP
Line_2937	THE SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
Line_2938	THE SOLT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
Line_2939	THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAM
Line_2940	THAT IS CALLED A SASOLUTION
Line_2941	TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OHER
Line_2942	THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATEL
Line_2943	WE CALL THAT A SALUTE
Line_2944	BECAUSE THE GREAPE STUFF DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
Line_2945	SOLUTIONS CAN BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED IN THE OTHER AND IT CAN BE TAKEN OUT
Line_2946	THE DIFFEREANCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THE SAME PROPERTY
Line_2947	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
Line_2948	THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM IS A SOLUTION
Line_2949	THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIANT INTO THE WATTEL TO MAKE A MIXTURE OF SOLUTE
Line_2950	THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
Line_2951	THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE SALT
Line_2952	WE CALL THE THING THAT'S UM DISSOLVES IS A SOLUT
Line_2953	THE SOL  THE SOLID SOL
Line_2954	WEL YOU ISWEIR ONE ANGOOD ENT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO  THE SOLVN
Line_2955	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
Line_2956	THE SOLVENT IS THAT IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS MIXTUE
Line_2957	IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOUSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
Line_2958	THEY KEEP THERT SAME MASS
Line_2959	I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT LOUSES ANY M
Line_2960	YOU COAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTAL
Line_2961	THIS IS A MIX JAW AND THE SHOGA STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF ITS PRODICAL SIDE
Line_2962	THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIX TE
Line_2963	FILTER OUT THE SOLLUTE AND A MIXTURE BUT NOT ANO SOLUTION
Line_2964	IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTIN
Line_2965	APPAORATE THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
Line_2966	THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
Line_2967	IT'S A GOOD WEIGH TO SEPARATE THEM
Line_2968	I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2969	WE'VE LEARNED THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SULVENT
Line_2970	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
Line_2971	E IS TWO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEY'R PROPPER
Line_2972	WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FIL ALS AND EVAPORATION
Line_2973	THE MATHE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISEM
Line_2974	THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE U BECAUSE THEY ALL PARTICAL SIZE IT'S PIGALE THAN THE WHOLE
Line_2975	PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICAL SID
Line_2976	THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
Line_2977	POTICAL SIDE AND MAGNET MAGNET
Line_2978	PARNICAL SIDE AND MAGNETISM
Line_2979	DIF FERENT WE USE DIFFERENT TOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS I HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTY
Line_2980	I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS SWIT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNET IGHT IN T
Line_2981	I NOTICE THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
Line_2982	I NOTICE THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP THE UM THAT FILLETAL WHEN THE OTHER THINGS WENT DOWN
Line_2983	I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY THING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED THA FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAED ON T
Line_2984	THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FULL EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
Line_2985	DON'T GO FARNEYBU
Line_2986	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
Line_2987	TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
Line_2988	HOW DENSE THEY ARE
Line_2989	THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PUPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE PUBBLE STUF
Line_2990	THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTE YOU AD TO THE SULVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATEDT IT IT
Line_2991	THE LIGTALE COLOW SOLUTIONS AR UH MORE DILUTED
Line_2992	I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLEGRA POWDER WILL TASE SMOWLLEY CREAP AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TAST MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAP
Line_2993	I THINK THAT UM ONE WITH LESS GREAY POWDER WI'LL TAST MORE LIKE WATER
Line_2994	THE TAST IS NOT A THICK I GUESS
Line_2995	UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2996	YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
Line_2997	YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WART
Line_2998	BY MERITY
Line_2999	THAT WE 'VE BEEN LEARNING
Line_3000	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
Line_3001	YOU COUN'T TEL IF IT'S MORE CONSHIEN IGETED IF UIT'S DARKE
Line_3002	I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEF
Line_3003	MY PRODICTION WAS RAIHT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3004	BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
Line_3005	WELL IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTIG
Line_3006	BYE THERE WEIGHT
Line_3007	NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS SOLIS THE MOST DILUTED
Line_3008	NUMBR WINE IS THE MOST CONJENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST COMMNRAT
Line_3009	IND
Line_3010	THATS WE LEARNED ABOUT SATUACION
Line_3011	THE COALK IS LESS DENCED THAN THE PENY AND THE PENY IS MORE DENCED THAN THE COL
Line_3012	I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN TO SOLUTION B
Line_3013	N SOLUTION  THEY WOULD THINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOW
Line_3014	YOU CAN SAY THAT IS MORE CONTRASTED
Line_3015	THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
Line_3016	THE MORTS ONE WILL SINK TO THE
Line_3017	THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WE'LL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LES DENSE WILL GO TO THE
Line_3018	IT JUST STAYES AT THE B

Line_3022	SEE YOU THERS DAY
Line_3023	UM YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A SOLUTIO
Line_3024	IT'S FOLGY AND THIS IT'S ALL BLENDED INT
Line_3025	THEY ARE TOS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
Line_3026	I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
Line_3027	THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMITS OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
Line_3028	REACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3029	I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
Line_3030	THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGHE SIXTY SEVEN
Line_3031	THEY'RE A PARTS FOR THE SOLUTION THELOCA GLOB
Line_3032	UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOULE SCOOPS OF CICRI CITRI ASCIT ASID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EASUM SALT
Line_3033	THEY ARE REACHING MAIL LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER
Line_3034	BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DANCITYES STUFF
Line_3035	DENCITY YEAH AND CONSOL AND SATOARA
Line_3036	UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
Line_3037	THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
Line_3038	I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACHE THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
Line_3039	SUBITANT NUMBER WINE
Line_3040	I'M DOING AH SOME
Line_3041	CEMICAL REACTION
Line_3042	REECRENTS
Line_3043	WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CCHEASID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
Line_3044	WE CALLE THESE REACTIONDS TAUGT AL
Line_3045	NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
Line_3046	I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
Line_3047	A LOT OF THEM KEE THEY'RE SANE PRIDET
Line_3048	I DON'T KNOW IFLESE HELP ME
Line_3049	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3050	WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CLORD
Line_3051	ALL OF THE MMOLECLUES AND THE DIFFERENT UM THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE UM
Line_3052	CAN BE SEPARATED
Line_3053	IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE ERTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE ERTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
Line_3054	YES BECAUSE OF THE COMPERVATION AN MAS
Line_3055	THE I SKIPS OF FLOWTING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FATHER
Line_3056	THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM PRIGHT
Line_3057	THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION C BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLE WIL
Line_3058	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
Line_3059	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
Line_3060	T I'S NOT A REACTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN MONE REACTIN TO BE ADDED
Line_3061	WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE PIKE WHICH MAKES THE CEMILCR REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE
Line_3062	A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM JSTSFOLD ID IN HA
Line_3063	THE CLOWSE STICK IS BEINGD GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FLD IT
Line_3064	YES CEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FILD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
Line_3065	COLNSULVATION
Line_3066	A KHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEING HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GREAT TAST IS ADDED TO THE WATE
Line_3067	NO I DON'T THINK IT CAN MICKAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
Line_3068	IND ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW CEM IF CEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED DOR NOT
Line_3069	THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
Line_3070	I SEE UH NOTI SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE
Line_3071	THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
Line_3072	WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES  ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHA
Line_3073	A MIXTURE
Line_3074	IT'S BEEN TAKING APART
Line_3075	THE  THE TRAIL MIXED HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A MBI
Line_3076	IT CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YE
Line_3077	THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FIL
Line_3078	IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULT ALL THE MIXTURES APPART BY USING DIFFERENT
Line_3079	IT LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED SO
Line_3080	YOU M CALL IT A SOLUTION
Line_3081	THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARES AND GOES INTO THE MOLECLULES OF THE WATER AND
Line_3082	NOW D
Line_3083	THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TIYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
Line_3084	I BY UH CAN YOU  ONES CENTANCE MAE Y SCCIITY
Line_3085	YOU COULD HIT YOUR FACE WHL YOU SO WELL GO
Line_3086	I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS D
Line_3087	THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPEARE
Line_3088	THE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
Line_3089	THE SOUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DIS APPES AFTER BEING MIXED OIT FIL HE WATER
Line_3090	THIS SOLVENT
Line_3091	EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
Line_3092	THE UM
Line_3093	IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
Line_3094	IT COUS A ENIMI OCLYIE
Line_3095	HOLDING A SWITCH THERE BARINIE
Line_3096	THIS SALT DISAPPEARED AND NOW IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER

Line_3109	BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
Line_3110	THEY'RES SEPARATING THE GRAVEL FROM THE RUST TO THE MIX THURE
Line_3111	THAT GRAVEL IS TO BIG TO FIT HIM THROUGH S

Line_3173	I IT DOESN'T LOOK DI BUT I THINK I I THINK THERE WAS
Line_3174	I SEE AND THE VINEGAR I SEE OXCIGIEN AND
Line_3175	THERE ARE OCRIGIN AND HIDRAGEN ATTOUMS AND A VINEGAR
Line_3176	THEY ARE IFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEAN THEY ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT TIPES

Line_3184	TWELLTHE TOMS ARE BLUE  TWO OF THE TOMS ARE BLUE
Line_3185	IT GETS PURPLE A LIKE JAS THAT'S SO
Line_3186	THERE WAS REACTION THAT LIKE THE WATER THE STUFF TURNED PURPLE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY COL AND  LIKE OVE
Line_3187	THE WATER OR THE SUBSTANCES POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
Line_3188	IT FAZED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN NOW IT'S KEE
Line_3189	IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BAR
Line_3190	IT STARTED FHIZING SO AND ONE IS FHIZING LIKE THAT SO IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
Line_3191	THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR
Line_3192	IT GETS TURN GREEN O WA'S GREAY IT
Line_3193	ACCHEMICAL REACTION ACCURED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED GRAIN WITH THE DRIP OF CURRENT FLOW
Line_3194	IT IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TROM P
Line_3195	IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE WATER TRING PURPLE A IT USE TO BE BLUE AND CLEAR
Line_3196	I THINK THE RAE CAUSE IT'S TURNING THE WATER'S TAING PA

Line_3319	IT MAY BE DWATER SUNLIGHT AND SEEL TWO
Line_3320	SPACE FEAR HIM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
Line_3321	THEY NEED WATER TO SERVIVE CAUS HUMANS NEED WATER TO SEIRVIVE
Line_3322	SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUID
Line_3323	PLANTS DO NOT NEAED WIND BUT THEY DO NEAED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUD
Line_3324	THEY DO NEED AIR BUT IT MATTERS ON IF IT STEALL TWO OR O TWO
Line_3325	THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON OSIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OCSIGAN FOR US
Line_3326	IT IS THE SUN AND THE SUN IS PART OF THE SYSTOM
Line_3327	YES BECAUSE IT COULD DRI THE PLANT OUT
Line_3328	I SEE A HAMBERGER I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBERGERS
Line_3329	IT DOESN'T NEED FOODS SO NO
Line_3330	IT SHOWES PLANT WATER I GUESS
Line_3331	I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE FLOM AND TS ILOM
Line_3332	THOSE ARE CINGLE CELL ORGANISMS OR EACH
Line_3333	IT HAS TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO
Line_3334	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3335	BUT THEY'RE IN MUSCIL SELLS
Line_3336	THAT THEY CAN GROW THE MORE YOU EXURSIZED
Line_3337	THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS M MUSSILS

Line_3355	FIRST OF ALL WE JUST LOOKED AT THIS SECOND WALL IT'S ABOUT BREATHING
Line_3356	BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE
Line_3357	BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR SELLS TO GET OCIGEN AND CARRY THEMATERAL
Line_3358	TO THEY GOWNNEE
Line_3359	ITF A SMALL I CAN'T CLICK ON IT SO

Line_3375	A TRAIN
Line_3376	ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS IN THE CAR
Line_3377	I SEE UM THE AXLS AND THE WEAELS WHICH HELPED THE CARMONE
Line_3378	IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBCISTUMS IN THIS BODY
Line_3379	ALL OF THE VANS THE LUNGS AND THE HART
Line_3380	THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCHE OF SUB SISTUM
Line_3381	A MIDT HAS THE ERTH IT HAS A WHOLE PUNHI SISTMS LITTLE SUB SISTM
Line_3382	BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUB SISTOMS IN IT TO HELP THE ERTH WORK
Line_3383	I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREESE HOUSES AND AN OTION

Line_3487	IT IS ON ERTH IT IS THE ERTH AND THAT IS A SST
Line_3488	THE INTERACTING PARTS AND IN IT
Line_3489	THIS I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THING
Line_3490	THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
Line_3491	I SEE IN OTCION HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES

Line_3495	I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND ICE
Line_3496	THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
Line_3497	TS MEANS THAT IT SHOWES WHAT ANIMALES ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
Line_3498	WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THEM
Line_3499	IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY ARE TO BE A D COMPOSEAR

Line_3521	FORMS UM D COMPOSE IT AND MAKE IT COMPOSED
Line_3522	IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
Line_3523	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SIX STUMS
Line_3524	THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE UM OF A BIG CITM
Line_3525	THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD HO DOSN'T S
Line_3526	IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SERVIVE

Line_3547	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3548	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT STUMS
Line_3549	THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT A I DON'T KNOW WACTUALLY SO YOU TELL ME
Line_3550	EST IS A FONGUIS
Line_3551	THAT IS SOMETHING
Line_3552	BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN ITS DORMENT STAGE
Line_3553	IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLAN TTHAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
Line_3554	SOMELIGHT WATER AND SWAIL
Line_3555	THAT IS WIND THE PIXCTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIE
Line_3556	THE SUN IS SOUMEAND THE PLANT NEEDS SOMELIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3557	THE PLANT NEEDS NEW TRANTS TO SERVIVE AS WELL
Line_3558	I DON'T KNOW
Line_3559	BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SERVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
Line_3560	THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SOED BY FOTO CINPHACIS
Line_3561	TO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WELT
Line_3562	PLANTS NEEDE SUNO SERVIVE AND THE AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANTS WELT
Line_3563	THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO
Line_3564	THE PLANTS GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIVE
Line_3565	THE PLANTS NEED EVERY THING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SERVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIVE AND WILT
Line_3566	BECAUSE IT HAS EVERY THING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
Line_3567	PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WERN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIVE
Line_3568	GOOD HOW ARE YOU
Line_3569	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SSTUMS AND THE DIJESTIVE SISTUM
Line_3570	THE DOG IS SCITTING THE BE IS COLLECTING POLLAND AND THE  THE GASE ARE FLYING

Line_3578	ONE IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAINE AND
Line_3579	THE NERVAS SISSTOM MAKES PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTALED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHIN
Line_3580	THEY ARE ANIMALS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3581	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIJESTIVE SISTOM
Line_3582	WHAT'S AN ABDA ADATATION
Line_3583	THE SCUMNCP IS
Line_3584	IT CAN DEFENDIT SELF FROM PREDETOR
Line_3585	IT'S ADDHAT ONE OF IT'S ABDAPTATIONS IS A IS IT'S SHELW BECAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SEIRVIVE FROM PREDT
Line_3586	WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
Line_3587	ONE OF IT'S ADEPTATIONS IS IT'S PODERON ON IT'S BACK AND ON IT'S BODDY SO THAT IT CAN BE CAMMFLASHED IN WITH IT'S HAPP TA
Line_3588	NUMBER TWO IT'S WEBED FEET
Line_3589	NEMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
Line_3590	IT'S WINGS TOUT IT CAN FLIE
Line_3591	BECAUSE IT CAN THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE POTERNE AWAY
Line_3592	THE SNAKE HAS AN ABDAPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
Line_3593	THE RATTL IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE WRATTL SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMMULA
Line_3594	IT IS ENVOLVING A SCUNCH WHICH IS FOD FOR THE WOULF
Line_3595	AN ADEPTATION THAT THE SCUNK HAS IS I SMELL THAT MAKES THE SCUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT A SMELL A
Line_3596	UM UM WHAT DOES CLASIFY MEAN

Line_3758	THE CIRCULARTORY CI
Line_3759	THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER  TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
Line_3760	THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE WHOLE SISTOM
Line_3761	ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
Line_3762	THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BYIO SFEER THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BYIO SFEER MAKING IT ON ENTIRE SIYSTOM REALLY
Line_3763	I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SISTUMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_3764	SORY I'M ON THE RONG UM HIS WEB SIDE
Line_3765	I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3766	I THINK THAT THOSE CELLES ARE UCED OR USED PARTICLES
Line_3767	CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT UMNATRALLY SORE
Line_3768	MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUIT AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
Line_3769	THAT PLANTS NEAED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SERVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEAED FOOD AND WATER TO SERVIVE
Line_3770	SONELIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BITT OF FIRNALISER
Line_3771	DEFINEATLY DETH AND LY DEFINETLY DAT THOUGHT OUT ARRILLA WE
Line_3772	I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT PLANS ALSO NEED AIR TO SERVIVE
Line_3773	IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEAEDS SOMELIGHT TO SERVIVE
Line_3774	WELL THE PLANS USE FOTO CINPHECIST TO GET THE IT FROM I MEAN TO START OVER
Line_3775	I THINK THAT IS EAS OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF LIKE SO
Line_3776	THAT THE BIG SEXCTIONS ARE BRAIN SFELLS
Line_3777	THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MEANY SELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG SELL
Line_3778	THE HUMAN BECAUSE GEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE SO THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIANS OF SAL
Line_3779	IT'S BUTTERFLY THAT IS
Line_3780	IT'S AN ENTIRE SISTOM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH OTHER LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DI JUST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
Line_3781	I'M DOING FIN
Line_3782	UH SCELS AND ORGANISMS AND SISTOUMS
Line_3783	THEY'RE BOTH UM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SELLS AND ONE SISTOM
Line_3784	PINK MUSLES IN IT IN THE LEG AND THERE A BUNCH OF TINEY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSLE
Line_3785	THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSTILE SELL
Line_3786	THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS AND THE BRAIN ORGANIZED
Line_3787	THAT THE HUMARN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT SELLS AND THE EST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE SELL
Line_3788	THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMULAR TO OURS LIKE WE NEED TO EET SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLYES NEED TO EET SO THAT THEY CAN FLYE AROUND
Line_3789	WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF SELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SISTOMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
Line_3790	THE ORGANISUMS AND SISTUMS IND SIDE OF OUR BODIYES
Line_3791	GETTING FOUD THROUGH IT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONIT IT IN THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END

Line_3795	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW OR WET WET NOT GRASS
Line_3796	IF WE DIDN'T BREAETHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIVE
Line_3797	I THINK J THE DIEGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE AIBLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
Line_3798	EACH THE A OLLAVIEOLY AUND YEAH THE OLVIOLEY EACH
Line_3799	GOOD O MISS LIKE HOW ARE YOU

Line_3802	AY END BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOS
Line_3803	ITS
Line_3804	I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
Line_3805	I'M DOING FINE TUCK TO ERLLIER
Line_3806	U CISTOMS PLANTS
Line_3807	I THINK THAT IS A HART
Line_3808	I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VAINS CONNECTING TO THE HEART
Line_3809	EACH TWO O AND O TWO
Line_3810	THE RED PART THAT THE BLUD CELLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH ARE THE VAINES AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
Line_3811	THAT'S THE BLUE PART IS CEL OUR SELVES AND THE RED PART IS CAVOLARY
Line_3812	IT S LETTING AND BLUD AND THEN PUSHING OUT THE BLOUD
Line_3813	THEY MOVE THE BLUD AROUND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BODY
Line_3814	BLUD VESILS THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOUD ABROUNT
Line_3815	THE PUM SPLOD AROUND THE BODY
Line_3816	L IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SIYSTOM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE
Line_3817	IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SISTOM
Line_3818	EXCHANGING OUR GASSES SO THAT WE CAN SERVIVE
Line_3819	UM THE LUNGS DEFENATLY THE LUNGS
Line_3820	EA THE LONG LOUTSE
Line_3821	THROUGH AN BE THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
Line_3822	THE TRECHIEA
Line_3823	THE WRATTEL SNAKES RATTAL
Line_3824	UM LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORIED WHEN HE SALW THE J SPILL OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
Line_3825	I AM DOING WELL BUT USED THE QUITE FAT MAN
Line_3826	UM I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
Line_3827	THAT THEY ALL HAVE SISTOMS INSIDE OF THEM
Line_3828	THE TORTICES SHELW IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
Line_3829	HIS WEDDD FEAT
Line_3830	NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN RIP OPEN HIS PREY
Line_3831	IT'S TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FIGAT IT
Line_3832	THE FLOCK OF GIEASE ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOST BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIORE
Line_3833	UM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WETHER
Line_3834	NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWES WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW A FRIS BEFORE IT
Line_3835	THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HEURTS SO THEY JUST GONN GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HEURT
Line_3836	I THINK THIS IS A NONLEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THE'E' SPECIAL REEFLEXES
Line_3837	WE HAVE BEEN LARNING ABOUT WETHER
Line_3838	BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
Line_3839	IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SIYSTOM
Line_3840	IT HAS TO DO WITH SIYSTOM THICE IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT I HAS SIYSTOMS IN IT
Line_3841	IT IS AN INACTION OF MOVING POUCH TOGETHER MAKING A CALP
Line_3842	IT HAS ALL KINDS OF POWD SIT MOVEMENT DWEALP TOGETHER
Line_3843	ITS BECAUSE IT HAS INTACTING POWERT'S MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SIYSTOM
Line_3844	THE HOLT AND THE IS
Line_3845	THERE IS MOVING POW IT'S MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONES THST
Line_3846	YEAHAVE TO MOUVE UND TO  WELK TOGETHER
Line_3847	THI I SEE WHIT'S A MOUNTON LOOKING THING YE AND IT HAS COURSCES STUMPS
Line_3848	UR SO
Line_3849	THEY HAVE NO PLANTS IN THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND AMINEALS
Line_3850	EGO SISTOM AND LIKE IS THE BIRON
Line_3851	THE THEP ARE LIOKING R AMINALS AND THE AMINALRS ALE EATAGH
Line_3852	A THE EMIALS PASSES THROUGH THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
Line_3853	UM THEY ALL PRODUCING A CISTIM OF THE ORG
Line_3854	ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE STUMES
Line_3855	IS A SISTOM WITH INTERACTING POWERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SISTOM
Line_3856	IF IS A BENTRAVINT OR ACTING PARTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTOM
Line_3857	I THINK BECAUSE AN ARM DEEBOUT MOVING THEGATHER
Line_3858	IS IT HAS BUNCH OF SUB CISTOMS EEN OR CAOMAKE ONE
Line_3859	I  THINK THAT THESE ARE CYPTITIUMS
Line_3860	TICICTIUMS BECAUSE IT'S ATHING AND E'RE ACTING ABOUT MOLING TOGETHER
Line_3861	THAT WLLKE DIC  TO PUI HORSES
Line_3862	GOOD
Line_3863	ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
Line_3864	UM IT'S ABOUT A HUMAN BODDY
Line_3865	IT'S PART OF ITS UM
Line_3866	IT'S BODDY PARTS
Line_3867	BECAUSE IT HAS SUB SISTOM
Line_3868	A HART ACIND NIEY AND
Line_3869	BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGER PART OF US OF SOME SUBCSIYSTOM
Line_3870	THEY'RE UR
Line_3871	IO SFVIEER IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3872	IN EGO SISTM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
Line_3873	IT'S LAND AND OTION
Line_3874	THE AROWBS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE E LIKE OR WHAT END WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
Line_3875	THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOWTS ON TOP OF THE WATER
Line_3876	I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
Line_3877	IT TOLD ME THAT IWAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
Line_3878	NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
Line_3879	I THINK THAT WARM PLACE IS WILL HAVE
Line_3880	IT MEANS THAT THE WATER OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE CIRFICE
Line_3881	THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE CIRFICE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO STRINK
Line_3882	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPER OR TINY DROP LITS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
Line_3883	WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW CIRFICE AREA AFFECS HOW MUCH WATER AND A CUP EVAPORATES
Line_3884	THE WATER ON THE CIRFICE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
Line_3885	NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED ME QUIT YET
Line_3886	YES I THINK PETALS EVAPORATE QUIGHTE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
Line_3887	I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIERT OR SOIL AND TEROCKS OR GRAVEL
Line_3888	THE WATER ON THE TAPBULE IS EVAPORATING
Line_3889	IT IS IN A GAS STA
Line_3890	THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUPRE CE WATER DROP PLITS IS CLOSCER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
Line_3891	THAT MEANS THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THEN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SAROUNDING AIR
Line_3892	IT COMES FROME THE WATER CITTING AND THE BOTTOUM OF THE CUP
Line_3893	WE MADE A WATER EL TO HELP US LIFT A PAPER CLIP
Line_3894	MARNING YOU'VE ALRADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
Line_3895	THAT'S ALL CAM MURNEY
Line_3896	THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WEAL IS TURNING
Line_3897	THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY BYE SEE YOU NEXT TEEER OR LATER THIS EER
Line_3898	WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT
Line_3899	WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY IT WEARE AND IT WAS PRETY COALL
Line_3900	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Line_3901	HEIR MASSES HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
Line_3902	METAL IS HAFIERTH AND PLASTICK AND WOOD SO THATI MAKES IT HEAVIER
Line_3903	THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT MMATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
Line_3904	THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST ALLOU EASIER TO YOUTH
Line_3905	I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKUETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
Line_3906	I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SKAW AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHT
Line_3907	THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BATH IN THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCAIL
Line_3908	TO SEE WHAT MATERIALS AI'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
Line_3909	W WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUP TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
Line_3910	IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CARECT
Line_3911	WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT THE EXACT WEIGHT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
Line_3912	TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVIY THE METAL DISK IS
Line_3913	WELL WE LOOKED OT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORED A GUES
Line_3914	YEAH YEAH YEAH
Line_3915	WON'T BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST ONET US TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
Line_3916	OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
Line_3917	WELL THE FIRST ONE I WAS RIGHT ONE AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AD AND IT GOT BETTER
Line_3918	TWENTY EACH EACH ROLE HAD TWENTY
Line_3919	WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE ELECTRIC CISTOM
Line_3920	YEAH YEAH
Line_3921	YOU GO BACK IN WHAT YEAH BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TA MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
Line_3922	UH YEAH
Line_3923	I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHINGS BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND COUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
Line_3924	YEAH OR YOU WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTHWIZE IT COLDN'T GET THROUGH
Line_3925	I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT UHM I DON'T GET IT
Line_3926	YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE THE SKEAL YEAH THE SKIL YEAH
Line_3927	NO DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
Line_3928	THEN WE COUN'T HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOR UM UM THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WAISTE THE PLASTA CIP
Line_3929	THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE A LITTLE
Line_3930	I NEOBLE METER YEAH YEAH
Line_3931	IT  NO NOT ET YEAH
Line_3932	YES THIS BUNE OH SORY
Line_3933	THAT WOULD BE FIVE PI
Line_3934	I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLASTICK WOULD GO UP
Line_3935	UH SORY UH
Line_3936	NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
Line_3937	YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
Line_3938	PROBABLY A GRAM BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
Line_3939	UWEN GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
Line_3940	I I I WAS MOST SURPRIZED THA I I I SHOLD GET IT OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZED SO THAT'S WHYE WHEY DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
Line_3941	THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY PLANK AND YOU WOULN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
Line_3942	WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME INSIZE F PAPER CLIP
Line_3943	HAY KAY
Line_3944	YES WE MEASURED OUR DETHS WITH STRAW
Line_3945	IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
Line_3946	UM RUBSICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DISCS ARE HIGER BUT THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
Line_3947	UM THEY ARE PRITY USFUL BUT THEY CANT BE USFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING BCAU
Line_3948	UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
Line_3949	NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
Line_3950	AH NOT REALLY NOW
Line_3951	NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T CLMAN YET NO
Line_3952	UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDNT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HAD ONE
Line_3953	UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
Line_3954	NO REALLY
Line_3955	OUH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT
Line_3956	UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER US USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT YEAH
Line_3957	YEAH
Line_3958	AH YEAH YEAH
Line_3959	THAT TAKE THEESE OFF OKAY
Line_3960	YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR HUM YET NO
Line_3961	YEAH JUST THIRTY AITE PIECES HENE I WALKED  EX YEAH
Line_3962	YEAH IT WATER BOD ENUGH I HAVE NO CLITTALE UL I DEAH NO
Line_3963	YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
Line_3964	NO WI DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_3965	TWENTY EAIGHT WEITERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE KNOW REALLY JUST MAYBE
Line_3966	UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO N AT THE  O YEAH
Line_3967	TIN YEAH
Line_3968	MAYBEBCAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE
Line_3969	I HAVE NO CLI AH SAYIN THAT'S CLOSE ISTER ANS YEAH
Line_3970	A BUT I DON' KNOW THE ANSWERS MOSGOS
Line_3971	IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRYE OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
Line_3972	UM YEAH SWE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMANTES THEY CAUGHT ILOTER YEAH
Line_3973	UM IS LEARN THAT
Line_3974	YEAH REPEETING THINGS IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONESE AND I'E HERD THAT ON SHOW WAS ALWAYS MIE OR TWICE YEAH
Line_3975	THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE GORES ON YEA
Line_3976	ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WORD FOR GUES
Line_3977	GRAM S ABOUT AS ONE FIC PAPER CLIP
Line_3978	M BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO ILOGRAMS AND HE THOUGH THAT IT WAS A MONSTER
Line_3979	UM A A GRAM IS THESBOUT AS ONE CO LOSE A PAPER TLIP
Line_3980	THEAS TO WAIGHCE AS MUCH I MEAN
Line_3981	UN YEHAH A THOUSANDS
Line_3982	A MILAGRAM AND THERE'S THOUSAND OF A GRAM WEIGH'S A THOUSAND OF A GRAM
Line_3983	M EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD BE ONE LINE
Line_3984	M THE SNAKE THAT SHIN THE YEAH
Line_3985	UM US THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRATE IT WOULDN'T BE SAT IS SLANTED
Line_3986	O CATE BUT I WANT TO SEE VENTERACKT TO CHIPS
Line_3987	ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHT MORE
Line_3988	WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
Line_3989	UM VEAE HACX LLY CERY FIVE
Line_3990	A HUNDRED PEN E QUALS
Line_3991	UM THAT THE THAT ORNA THE BEANS EQUALES A GRAM
Line_3992	YEA THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
Line_3993	UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
Line_3994	A HUNDRED CRAMS ONE THOUSAND
Line_3995	UM  CTS CEE
Line_3996	UM PAPER CLIP ON ONE SIDE WAS UM
Line_3997	WE HAD TWO MORE LIKE THAT ONE
Line_3998	IT'S THE INDERACTIVE CLIPS
Line_3999	DIFFERENT MASSES I WANE TO SEE THEY DIFFERENT MASSES
Line_4000	AND WE DID WEIGHT WITH PAPER CLIPS
Line_4001	HE LIKE THAT THING IS GOING H HESIN GOES UP
Line_4002	READING RITING AND MASS MAINLY
Line_4003	EY HU HU UH SLICHES RED
Line_4004	OH YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DISC WITH THE STRAWS
Line_4005	YEAH I WAS BLOWING THAT MINE A BIT
Line_4006	CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE'S DISCK WITH THREE BY TWO BAT MINE WAS TWEN NINE TENTH BY TWO
Line_4007	BECAUSE MY DISCK SEAMED SHORTED AND ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
Line_4008	CLOSE TO YEAH BECAUSE THREE AND NINE TENTH IS A I MEAN TWO AN NINE TENTH WAS ALMOST THREE
Line_4009	UM A METER IS THREE PWENT SOMETHING FEET
Line_4010	MHEN OKAY
Line_4011	HERE NO WELL YEAH WE DID WE DON'T GO HOLEDR S FISY MAKDES
Line_4012	UM METER TAPE AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR NAMES THEY ARE
Line_4013	NOS  IT  IT ISN'T COLORED AT ALL
Line_4014	YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I'V I HAVE NO IDEA YOU MIGHT COLOAR IT SOMETIME
Line_4015	THOSE THINGS MARK CENTIMETERS SALT OCAY
Line_4016	A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDRETH OF A METER IT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER I'M ALL THEWAY ALON LIKE IT
Line_4017	NO WE'D JUSTSTARD WE' JUSTSTARTED CUTING IT OUT AND GALLOUED IT TOGETHER
Line_4018	ONE TEN MILLIMETERS EQUALES ONE TEANNE CENT TO BE
Line_4019	THAT'S WHAT THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTMETER ONE TWO THREE FOR SIX ARNIG NIGNE TEN IN THOSE
Line_4020	TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
Line_4021	WHE DOES SKAL ONE MILLIMETER
Line_4022	OKAY
Line_4023	I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE R I DON'T WANT TO GET REID OF THE
Line_4024	OCAY H IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT'S SA
Line_4025	I KNOW BUT WHAT'S NUMBER FORE I SAY THOS
Line_4026	WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
Line_4027	LEATERS NO CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
Line_4028	NO LET'S SEE COMPARE VILES YEAH HAH THAT'S LIKE WHAT OARS WERE
Line_4029	UM  A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUALE TO ONE LITER AND NOH
Line_4030	MM NOT I  I KNOW LIKE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT IT WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN  CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
Line_4031	UBOU MEDIEAH LAT THE SUCH THING AS A KILILITER I THINK
Line_4032	UA LOT OF WATER
Line_4033	NEOAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
Line_4034	UM YOU COULD MEASURE OUT
Line_4035	UM UVES A THOUSAND
Line_4036	OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GIVAUM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
Line_4037	ONE MILLOWLE E TRAVEALLIY EQUALS A MILLOWLE A MILLOMETER
Line_4038	UM YOU WOULD SINE THE CUPS THAT LOOK LIKE THEN AND YOUWOULD PUR IT IN YEAH
Line_4039	WELH WELH I WANNA DO GRAJURATE JYEAH OP
Line_4040	YEAH YOU CALLE OS THOSE STHICKGS WHOOPS
Line_4041	WELL THAT CHELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
Line_4042	PASTENT THIS IS ON BACK COURRAGE THAT'S WHIY IT'S SOME FALLING OFF
Line_4043	UM A HUNDRED MILLYLITERS
Line_4044	NO NO NETHER WE HAVEN'T DON IT YET
Line_4045	WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET THE TEAER HAS ONLY HROW IN US WE DID THE VIL THING AND THEN THE TEAL HAS ALSO SHOWED US BUT
Line_4046	I CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU CAN
Line_4047	THAT LIKE AND THE M  JUSTTHING ABOUT
Line_4048	WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT OF VILES AND SOME PEOPLES SAY ENCE  A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
Line_4049	UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LEATER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
Line_4050	LIQUIDS THE VOLIUME OF THINGS
Line_4051	MASS THE LENGTH OR WITTH OR HEIGHT
Line_4052	WHAT THE   D SAY I SEEN PINK ATTENT NERICING YOU BY THIS THING
Line_4053	UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT OF THE STUFF
Line_4054	YEAH IT'S NOT THE IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPTHS AND HIGHT AND LENKTHS HIGHT WITH DEPTHS AND LENKTHS
Line_4055	BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE US HEARY GOOD NO NO THAT ONE WAT DID WE DO THIS WORK
Line_4056	THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSAND OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OF IT
Line_4057	WIY  ISN'T W O TEN
Line_4058	LIKE H  REACHING UM PROBLY THE EATHER THE LESST ONE  THE S

Line_4061	M UN MODO LEAED WHAY WHAT WERE YOU PREACHING WHAT WERE YOU SA COOLD WHAT WERE YOU SAY IN US
Line_4062	UM TROP SPABOLE MILLALITERS
Line_4063	WELL BUT I WANE TO SEE THE FIRST TIM ONE I DON'T FORGET THE
Line_4064	NU WE WERENTUSING VILES WE USED VILES A LONG TIME AGO
Line_4065	YEAH MM WELL NOH WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIMES
Line_4066	M NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE B LINE A SEE LINE A D LINE
Line_4067	THE SERRENDIS A THING THAT SORT I TUCKS OF WATER IT'S AND THEN IT KELLS YOU HOW MUCH IT IS IN THEYRE THAT YOU STUCKED UP
Line_4068	WELL BYE THOSE THINGS ON THE
Line_4069	YEAH WIT'S NO
Line_4070	YEAH THAT WAS THE LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BRIK
Line_4071	BECAUSE THE VILES WERE DIFFERENT YEAH MILLILITERS
Line_4072	UM FIFTEEN MOST OF OUR GRADUATED SIELLNDERS BUT THOSE ONE'S HAVE A HUNDRED
Line_4073	ONE LIATER
Line_4074	UM  HOW MANY OH THAT'S A THOUSADN THAT BIG THING AND THE ONE LITER
Line_4075	MORWI'S THE SOICCAN THE INTERACTIVE SODA CANIL I LIKE THE INTERRACTIVE ONES NO
Line_4076	NO BUT WA A HUNDRED NOLY THAT LOOKS NEET EQUILLS
Line_4077	TWO A HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADURATED SELANDERS EQUAL WHAT'S THAT
Line_4078	THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT CALLED IS WAT IE WONDERING OH TWEY
Line_4079	WELL BECAUSE THAT ONE'S WIDE IF YOU FLATTEN THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT
Line_4080	UM WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED NILLILITERS
Line_4081	WELL EM ELSTOWNS STANDS FOR MILLLITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER AND TWENTIVIT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLLITERS IT IS
Line_4082	YOU WHAT YOU DO WIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU' LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER IS LIGNED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LIGHEDOUGH TO IS THE OE AT YOURE
Line_4083	YE A
Line_4084	UM UM OH HE NOT REALLY
Line_4085	BUT I WOL N'T LOK AT THAT INCH THAT SAILL MAN TO REACT DO SEAING IT IT WAS

Line_4092	BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND  SAID TO A CARPENDER
Line_4093	U I WANT I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOME ONE WHO WORKED OT A GRCERY'S STOOR INSIDE YOU WANTED
Line_4094	NINE PAPER CLIP S
Line_4095	M A PFOLES PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD A  USE MALN HE COULD'VE USED BIG
Line_4096	POUNDS AND THAT STUFF
Line_4097	SO IT  SAY ONE POUND IT WOULD YOU WANTED ONE POUND THE SOME THING
Line_4098	WE JUST STARTED AT THE UM UNI ON FRIDAY
Line_4099	PAPER CLIP UHN
Line_4100	AND PLASTRIC CHIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND THEY DON'T WEIGH THE SAME
Line_4101	UMH UH GOOD TO USE SHUR MEASURE I MEAN WIT
Line_4102	IIT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE SHE WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
Line_4103	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN DOING MEASUREMINTT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
Line_4104	USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT  USE DIFFERENT STRAWS
Line_4105	ONE WOULD BE SMALL AND ONE WOULD BE HOUGE
Line_4106	BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND ROUPAG WOULD BE SO
Line_4107	WITH THE RULEAR  TAPE MEASURED
Line_4108	WELL MOST DRIL MOST DRIVLARS ARE THE SAME
Line_4109	SAME LENGK SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
Line_4110	THAT A WILLAR WOULD BE ESIER TO USE
Line_4111	IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURE BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES SHE WOULDN'T USE MEET METERS
Line_4112	I NOTICE A HUNDRED A HUNDRETH OF A CENTRIMETERS
Line_4113	A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AR AND A METER
Line_4114	MY DAD MEASURES WIT UM BILDS BILDING SO HE USES HOW LOT IS THIS STUFF
Line_4115	BECAUSE TEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A A KILOMETER
Line_4116	YOU YOU WOULD PUT THE ZERAL ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TILL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
Line_4117	YOU WOLD KNOW HOW LONG IT WOUL THE WOULD BE
Line_4118	BECAUSE THA BECAUSE THE TAE
Line_4119	BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD UM MARK THE SPOT
Line_4120	OKAY THAT IT WAS TEN CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_4121	UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4122	WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURES IT MEASURES ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
Line_4123	UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METERE TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_4124	LIKE COMPUTORS DOORS BOOKS
Line_4125	WELL UM DOARS AR UM CAN BE
Line_4126	WIDER THEN TAPE THEN TABLES ARE HI
Line_4127	UM ROULERS
Line_4128	WELL IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
Line_4129	THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
Line_4130	WELL ONE OF THEM IS STREAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF WABLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE T THE CORECT WAY
Line_4131	SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4132	METERS SO THERE IS ONE HUNDRED SCIZE IMETERS AND A METER RIGHT
Line_4133	NO METERS CAN REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
Line_4134	I COULD
Line_4135	YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
Line_4136	THERE IS TEN UM MILLIMETERS AND THE CENTIMETER
Line_4137	I DON'T KNE YOU
Line_4138	NO MIRALLY NOT SO MUCH
Line_4139	SPUNGES SPUNGES THEY SOK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEEN STUFF
Line_4140	GRAMS OR MEASURING TWOLS
Line_4141	AND THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURED OUT WITH THE GRAMS
Line_4142	WELL YOU'R LOOKIN FOR UNTILL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED
Line_4143	SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPUNGE IN ITS LIKE THIS HAND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM THOM ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRTY BAOANCE RIGHT
Line_4144	YOU  YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COUT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPUONGE
Line_4145	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WEIT SPUNGE YOU WEIHT UNTILL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
Line_4146	IT CAN GET MESCEY P
Line_4147	UM HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT UH DRY SPONGE CAN HOLD
Line_4148	AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS AND ONE BY ONE AGAIN
Line_4149	YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THOUNK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4150	YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TO IF IT'S LIKE AN HEAVY ITDUM YOU CAN GO BY FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4151	AND THEN YOUD TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TO HEAVI ONE YOU PUT IN ANOTHER FIVE YOULD TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
Line_4152	UM THE DRY SPUNGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN YU REALLI REMEMBER
Line_4153	UM THE
Line_4154	LIGHT VERY LIGHTS
Line_4155	TWENTY WE GOT
Line_4156	TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WEIGH TWENTY FOR GRAMS OF WATER
Line_4157	AND THE END THE DRY SPUNGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
Line_4158	UM IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPUONGE SO SO WE ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_4159	BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UN EVENLY
Line_4160	THE BIGGER THE BIG SPONGE COULD HU MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRIYIE
Line_4161	I DON'T KNOW REALLY UHO
Line_4162	WELL WELL YOU YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT
Line_4163	SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY BIG WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIG IND SOULKED IT'S GOING TO BE JIGANTIC
Line_4164	WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVI OBJECT YOU DON'T WANTA GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
Line_4165	I HAVE NO IDEA WEALL YE HAD A GNOD IDEA
Line_4166	THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN AN ORANCH
Line_4167	BECAUSE IT MAYBE TO MUCH
Line_4168	MAYBE YEAH I MAYBE MORE THAN ONE KILGRAN
Line_4169	MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVIY
Line_4170	IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSAL I WOULD USE A
Line_4171	MILLGRIEN I THINK THERE I'S THESE THINGS CALLED MILLGRAMS I CANT REMEMBER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILGRAM OH YEAH
Line_4172	WHEN WES METER ITS LIKE
Line_4173	LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_4174	MAYBE THE LANS FROM
Line_4175	TEXIS FROM HERE MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4176	CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS AMASING YEAH HAH A
Line_4177	DRYE SPONGE A A CALMANE
Line_4178	AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESING
Line_4179	NOT REALLY JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
Line_4180	A HUNDRED THOUSAND MHA H WAH
Line_4181	TASTING CASTING
Line_4182	WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE COULD HOLD
Line_4183	CAN REALLY REMEMBER
Line_4184	WEL HEA
Line_4185	LEVELE MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BARE IS LIGNED UP WITH THIS DE
Line_4186	UM IT'S A BALANCE
Line_4187	AN EMPTY WATER BOTTL OR SOMETHING
Line_4188	IF YOU ON'T  PUT ANOTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
Line_4189	MORE IMFINENTLY MORE BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IN IT
Line_4190	UM IT THE THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED INTO A FIVE BLOCK
Line_4191	UM THE WATER AND THISPUNGE
Line_4192	UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCKUETS
Line_4193	I THOUGT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4194	BECAUSE IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
Line_4195	THE KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
Line_4196	MAYBE THAT TOP COMPUTOR A BAG
Line_4197	OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WEIGHT THAT OUNES SIXTEEN OUNCIS A POWEDER
Line_4198	THEN MY DAD FLMY HOME HE HHE USED TO HAVE A JOB IN CALIFORNIA
Line_4199	UM WELL THEN WE HAD THE I CAN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS COLED
Line_4200	YEAH IT'S IT SAID LIKE FIVE TIMES FIFTEEN TWENTY UP TO FIFTY PRTY
Line_4201	UM IT WASN'T THE MOST EFICIENT WAY BUT STILL IT WAS THE BEST YOU COULD GET WITH SCHOL STUFF
Line_4202	UM USING SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFICK LIKE UM
Line_4203	NO WE WE HAD TWENTY SIZE AND OUR GRADUATED SILNDER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED AND THE CONTAINER
Line_4204	UM WELL
Line_4205	WELL I CAN REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENTS
Line_4206	WELL YEAH WELL U SORE ITS WAS WHAT HAPPEND I JUST CAN REPEATE IT ALL
Line_4207	THIS UM OUR CONTAINER DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ONE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED S TO FLIKE THAT

Line_4413	THAT IT HAD WATER ON THE SOTA WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
Line_4414	M THAT YOU WANNED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RIGHT THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME I THINK
Line_4415	UH WHITH NUMBER WAS IT
Line_4416	I THINK UP YEAH
Line_4417	UH MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CANS AND HOW MUCH WATER COULD TAKE
Line_4418	UHM  LIKE
Line_4419	I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
Line_4420	PE LIKE HOW LIKE
Line_4421	SO IT COULDN'T DROP THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER
Line_4422	I DON'T KNOW WEU JUST DID THAT
Line_4423	YEAH UHU
Line_4424	NO YEAH BUT THE CORRANGE HAD BIG CORRANGES AND LITTLE CORANGES
Line_4425	MONE MENNO LITERS YEAH

Line_4431	UM I LEARNED THAT
Line_4432	THAT AMERICAS D ONLY A SICE THAT DOESN'T USE THE MLECTRIC SIYSTOM
Line_4433	WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4434	IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THAT IT WOULN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
Line_4435	IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4436	BECAUSE IT'S NOT  NOT ALL STRAWS ORF THE SAME HEIGHT
Line_4437	UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
Line_4438	WERE THEY SOME OF THEM WERE CENTR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
Line_4439	YES WE WE COUTT IT OUT THEWE COULDN'T WELL UM ONCE WE COUTT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WE
Line_4440	UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
Line_4441	YEAH BUT UM H WE
Line_4442	MEASURED UHM THE BOOK SHELLVES
Line_4443	BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE CLOSE THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO R
Line_4444	KNO
Line_4445	WELL UM LIKE I SAID WE TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WILL ONE ENCH SIX ENT
Line_4446	AND NEEDE NO
Line_4447	IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IT NEVER CHANGES
Line_4448	BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE A LLITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT IN THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
Line_4449	IT WAS NONE I MEAN THREE  A S M BECAUSE THEY WERE TINIY
Line_4450	BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINEY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4451	IT'S WRK NO
Line_4452	IT'S NOT A STAND THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Line_4453	THAT T EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
Line_4454	UM THE GRAMS
Line_4455	LIKE I SAID THESE WERE LIKE THE CLUBS THE ONE AND THE FIVE
Line_4456	UM IT'S TO FIDIT BY SS
Line_4457	YES THE THE CHIP
Line_4458	YES DYOU REMEMBER WHAT THE RESULTS WERE H MILES
Line_4459	YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
Line_4460	UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOMETIMES
Line_4461	IT UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE KLUB BLU JUST USE PAPER CLIPS INSTEAD
Line_4462	WELL WE PUT LIKE GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN
Line_4463	WE WE TRYIED TO GET WITH OUR THEGRAMS WE TRIED TO GET
Line_4464	IN STEAD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL THOSE BULKS WE COULD JUST US
Line_4465	THEA THAAT TEN THATE
Line_4466	AT TENND ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
Line_4467	YEAH OR OR USING THE HOCKXS THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
Line_4468	UN KIND OF
Line_4469	YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TURMS DOURING IT SO IT TOOK LONGER AND SO JUST ONE PERSON
Line_4470	YEAH AND ONE TIME IT WAS LIKE AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS THAT SIX AN IT WAS HAT SEVEN THEN IT WAS LIKE EIGHT THENIT WAS THAT SIX YEAH IT WAS FIRED
Line_4471	YEAH YEAH UM MAYBE BECAUSE
Line_4472	BECAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE UM
Line_4473	H MO UH MAYBE BECAUSE WE CAN TELL IT SO WELL THAT
Line_4474	UM JUST KEEP IT IN ONE SPOT
Line_4475	UHM
Line_4476	YEAH YEAH AND THEN HEAR TEACHER SHE ONLY MEAN MASCED UP UM LAST TWO
Line_4477	YES EXCEPT WE DIDN'T LIKE TO COLE MEENIAUM WE JUST SIDE IT AND THE ORDER
Line_4478	AN TUFFIY A YEAH
Line_4479	YEA STOPPED THAT LAST YEAH
Line_4480	THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN ENDED AT SIX SO IT WAS IN'T BETWEEN THES
Line_4481	UM WELL I AN
Line_4482	AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BACE THE FULECRUM AND THE BALANCE
Line_4483	WELL IT JUST UM THAT'S THE BALANCE UM IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLEWAPPY
Line_4484	WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
Line_4485	A BIG ONE LEAKE YEAH BIG ONE IT CLLS A GRAM
Line_4486	WE'RE WORLKING WITH THAT THAT  THAT
Line_4487	YEAH YEAH
Line_4488	YEAH WEALL FIRST I WHOLD UP MY HAND AND I WEIGH IT THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
Line_4489	YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USED
Line_4490	M HO AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL I NO
Line_4491	YEAH OHSOUH YEAH
Line_4492	UM I'M NOT SHURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT
Line_4493	NOT ALL THE WEIGH NOT ALL THE WEIGHT
Line_4494	NOT A FIR PLIECE
Line_4495	YEAH  ONE MILLALUS
Line_4496	UM ONE HUNDRED AND MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
Line_4497	WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT IT JUST FLIPED UP
Line_4498	I THINK IT' IT'S TRYING TO TRICK US BUT  YOU JUST DID THAT W YOU'R EARADY DID THAT
Line_4499	HOH WELL THEN WE PROBLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
Line_4500	THAT'S A THAT'S  UM
Line_4501	THE LIRONS WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FOL IT WOULD BE IT
Line_4502	YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK IT CULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE HR ANYWAYS
Line_4503	WELL BECAUSE THAT IF YOU USED THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONES WIDER
Line_4504	REALLY YEAH
Line_4505	WE USED PAPER CLIPS ANDPLASTIC CIPS AND
Line_4506	WELL WEU WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCAIL THING WE HAD PUT IT ON THIS ONE AN IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD OU PUT MORE MORE MORE TO LOOK OUT EVEN TA
Line_4507	IT UM THERE'S MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THAT WOULDN
Line_4508	HOLPS UM
Line_4509	TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TWO
Line_4510	MEAYEAH AND
Line_4511	TAKE UT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A HUM ONY GRAMS AND THEN WILL GO T BUT IT'S FLOWTIEN IT'S FLOWTING
Line_4512	ONE THOUSAND SHE'S M
Line_4513	THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
Line_4514	I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4515	CRUES AND GO OSOUM
Line_4516	WOLL GET BYE-BYE
Line_4517	UH YEAH
Line_4518	HIE S
Line_4519	AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
Line_4520	WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHT IT PUT ANOTHER PUT UM THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
Line_4521	BUT THE DRY SPUNGE STME DO NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
Line_4522	UM THREE GRAMS
Line_4523	DO OT WHAT SOKED UP ALL IS WATER AS IT COULOD THEN WE WEITED AGAIN
Line_4524	LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
Line_4525	SIX TEEN GRANS
Line_4526	TO CLEAEN BECAUSE IT SHOWES WHEIT AND WITH DIRTY WATER IT WOULD AKSOURBE THE DIRTY WATER SSPES O
Line_4527	NO LONEDA  I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Line_4528	EMTY CUPS CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
Line_4529	IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVIY
Line_4530	IT HOLDS COALL IS YOUDON'T ALWAYS HAP TO TUP WITH THAT YOU CON TUP THE PAR
Line_4531	O KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
Line_4532	ONE THOUSAND EVERY KNOW THAT I DIN'T HAVE TO LICK
Line_4533	KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDERD UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OF FIVE GRAMS
Line_4534	ONE A HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
Line_4535	WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO KILOGRAM IS PROLY GUENEBE IT IS HEAVY AS
Line_4536	TWENTY GRAMS ARE TWENTY CHEESE
Line_4537	AND THAT WOULNDN'T WOULD BE TEN GRAMS BECAUSE IT'S THIS S HAS A LOT OF
Line_4538	ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
Line_4539	WATER IS  PIXTURES THIS HEAVY IS A KILOGRAM
Line_4540	KILOECAM PLES ONE L OF WATER LIATER
Line_4541	YEAH MISSUS MIT STOLL TA FUNE PART TWO
Line_4542	FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPUNGE WE UM MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WEIGT SPUNGE BUT THE DRY SPUNGE
Line_4543	AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
Line_4544	THREE FOR FIVE SIX
Line_4545	THAT'S FIVE AND THEN THAT'S ONE TEN
Line_4546	IT WIL INSTEAD OF OASE HAVING TO USE UM JUST SMALL LITTLE PIECES THAT CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
Line_4547	TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
Line_4548	AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALED OUT SO B FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS IT CANOUT AND THAT'S IT
Line_4549	SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THEN SHOULD BE SIX TEEN S MAKE IT AWY SO THE WATER
Line_4550	WELL UM THERE'S AROLOCK ERUH LOCKET IN SIDE OF IM
Line_4551	AND YEAH AND THEN IT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
Line_4552	THROUH AND THE'RE IN THE SPONGE YEAH
Line_4553	YEAH AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER THESE WATERS HEAVY
Line_4554	YES IF THEY RALOCK IALL THE ARAULLOCK IT'S GOING ALL AWAY TO THE TOP
Line_4555	ANE IF YOU ACTUALLY WEAIHT BUT IMSE IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
Line_4556	HOKAY JNOH YOU EN' GO BACK UP TO HERES
Line_4557	WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS WUT SP WITH THE WATER IN IT
Line_4558	YEAH YOU HAVE A SCAIL AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUTS YOUR VEJTIABLES AND S
Line_4559	PUT THE SCAIL AND WEIGHESE
Line_4560	YEAH THE LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE N YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT F
Line_4561	SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOLING SAYING SEEING WA HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
Line_4562	IT MAKES IT A SYSTAM BECAUSE THE PROPELLAR IS SPINNING AROUND
Line_4563	I SEEN IT IS ALL ABOUT
Line_4564	EIT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GORDIEN THEY HAVE TO PUT AN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DM THEY CAN BRAKE
Line_4565	THESE ELOTRECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOS AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
Line_4566	I THINK WHAT THE BACE SELL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
Line_4567	YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
Line_4568	WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNE THE FOX
Line_4569	I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING ME AND SEING HOW FAR IT GOES
Line_4570	I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MIXIC A FILTER SIYSTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNSES OFF AND IT WHOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU KNO ONE A BOUN IT OFF THAT HIGHT BECAUSE IT STICK AND RIGHT
Line_4571	WE THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FARE YEO GO MAYBE
Line_4572	O  F HEAVIY A BUL BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4573	YOU CAN NOT SO UHM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO
Line_4574	UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT WHOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
Line_4575	I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEING HOW FAR IT GOS AND SEEING THE LITTLE THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
Line_4576	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOTS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDLUMS IN THE BOTS AND SEING HOW MANY PENDLMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOT
Line_4577	UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PIGNICK IN THEM
Line_4578	WE
Line_4579	YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF LIVE PULBS YOU CAN BILLD THEM OUT OF WOOD
Line_4580	I BILLS MINE OUT PAINT OUT PAPER CUPS
Line_4581	I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTING PENIES IN IT OR WATER
Line_4582	I DISCOVERED THAT THE BULLB CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDILAMS AND AND THE LITTL BUB
Line_4583	WHY TIYT THINK THEY GOT IT DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENICES BECAUSE THEY CAUT IT THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
Line_4584	ABOUT ELEVEN AND STE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEIST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
Line_4585	I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
Line_4586	THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE ARPLAN COULD FLIY AND THE STRING
Line_4587	I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AROPLAN FLI
Line_4588	I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FINING YOUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGLING A LOHT AND THAT YOU PREPELL AR SPIONGE
Line_4589	I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GOING TO GO  BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAGT
Line_4590	BU IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TWO
Line_4591	WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PRAPELLAR IS THE STRING IS MICKING AT A BALANCING AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PERPLE ARE KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
Line_4592	YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLAR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLAR SPIN
Line_4593	O CASA HOW MANY SPONS IT TAKE SPONS ARE FORTY FIVE SPONS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METER IS YOU MEASURE IT
Line_4594	I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
Line_4595	AND I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PREPELLOR SPIN AND IF YE DON'T HAVE THAE ROUN THE WATTOUM IT'S LIKE IN YO WORK
Line_4596	I THINK ONES SETTING UP T MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKIT TO PUT IT TOGETHER BU IT WIRKED REALLY WELL AND
Line_4597	SELL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNEY
Line_4598	THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE EXAXISS THE PENTILAM LENGTH JUST THE PENTILAM LIKE THEN NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
Line_4599	SO I COULD USE THIS GRAMFER PRODICTING WHAT'S FOR TEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
Line_4600	THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTARMETERS SWINING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS
Line_4601	YOU COULD TEST MUH YOU COULD TEST YOU'R PRODICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
Line_4602	THE LENGTH OF THE PENJULAM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE LONGER THE A PENDULAM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULAM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
Line_4603	THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
Line_4604	LEARNING ABOUT VARIEABLES AND MAKING PENDOULUMS AND BOTS
Line_4605	TO SEE HOW MANY PENIYES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT STINKING
Line_4606	IF YOU CHECK A PENY AT THE BUELT AND IT GOES IN
Line_4607	YOU NEED TO SPRED THEM EVENLY YOU CANT JUST PUT THEM IN RANDAMELY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDAMELY YOURE ABOUT WILL TIP IT OVER TO ONE SIDE
Line_4608	ONE OF THE BUTS COULD HVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHERS CUD END THE FORT AND AY COULD AVE BEEN REALLY SKINIY
Line_4609	HOW THE PENIYS WERE STACKED WOULD SAY A WOULD STACK REALLY SLOFFILLY AND D WOULD STACKED REALLY NICE
Line_4610	UM ONE SIDE IS OWMORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
Line_4611	YES
Line_4612	I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
Line_4613	U CLOARTK AND YEAH
Line_4614	ANT OAN WE ALSO IT MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCE IS WAS
Line_4615	O I THINK FLE
Line_4616	THE UM THE METER STICK HUCK IS TANNING UP ANDANDLOW
Line_4617	D THAT I DUM AND AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S FLIPPY
Line_4618	THE THE LITTLE ONE IS POUNCING OFF THE WALL AND
Line_4619	AND THE BIG ONE IS IS POUNSING OFF THE WALL AND ON TO THE GROUND
Line_4620	WE'VE BEEN MAKEING AIR PLNS AND EVERYTHING
Line_4621	YES WE HEA JI GRAS ABOUT PENCILLUMS
Line_4622	IT WAS ABOUT LIKE WELVE OR NINE
Line_4623	A TWENTY PENGJULM HAT IS FIF
Line_4624	THAT ON THE LA SIDE UM
Line_4625	IAN NUMBER OF
Line_4626	IT'S HOW MANY SWINGS IT WAS
Line_4627	THE NUMBER OF TWAINGE AND THE PEN WHICH ONE THAT LENT IT IS
Line_4628	WELL WE  WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKEING THE PLAIN BUT WE DIDN'T FORGET TO FINISH IT
Line_4629	YHES THEY ARO PLAIN AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WE'RE MAKING HING SOME OT
Line_4630	WE HAD UM THAT
Line_4631	A LOE PADELE  THING FOUR THE WENDSING FOR THE FRONT
Line_4632	THE AIR PLAIN IS WHEN THE THE LINE
Line_4633	EU HAVEN'T TRIED TO PLAIN YET
Line_4634	DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE EY HAVE EN'T TRYED IT YET
Line_4635	I AM GOOD THANK YOU YOU FOR ASKING
Line_4636	CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANY THING DIFFERENT
Line_4637	I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I KNOW I  I I CAN REALLY HAVE IT IN MY MIND BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT  WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
Line_4638	THE FIRST LINE IS  UM
Line_4639	YOU CAN USE THE GRALF WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELVES UM YOU CAN DRA THE NUMBERS AND IT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
Line_4640	WHAT I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE LIGNE WOULD BE UM I THINK IT IS SHOWING LIKE
Line_4641	H IT'S GOING YEALL YOUA
Line_4642	WELL THEY MARK THE GRASS AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
Line_4643	I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM LENGTH MAY BE MARKS UND HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK
Line_4644	U THE NUMBERS ARE LIGHTED THERE AND UHM THE NAME WEAR IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENJULUM
Line_4645	DO YOU MEAN THAT THE BOTTOM NOT OR THE HIHEST NOT
Line_4646	U IT'S GOL END WHILE
Line_4647	IT'S GOING VARUWEL THINGS
Line_4648	ISS UM STRUDDY LEARNING ABOUT CATTIPULES
Line_4649	I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED AWITH THAT SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT IT
Line_4650	IN IN A POP SICLE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE TO PUT ON THERE
Line_4651	TH UM THINK YOU I SEE THAT POPSICAL STICK THAT THINK YOU PUT ON IT SAY CM CHUMPTHE M
Line_4652	YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORT YOU UND THE RUBERS THE RIBERSTOPPER
Line_4653	IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM THAT LOWE I DON'T THINK IT'S GON I DON'T PUILY PART
Line_4654	IT GOES IT GOES FLING IT GOES FLANK UTHE LE LIP STICK
Line_4655	UMJUNEY I THINK ITN
Line_4656	E'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOTS
Line_4657	YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM SLOW AND THEI'R ATHER  UR THEY'LL UM DOWN
Line_4658	TO FLOWT ON WATER AND EUM PEOPLE TO GET ON THEM AND SEE THAT OTION
Line_4659	SISERS UMWATER AND UAT'S IT
Line_4660	WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENIES IT COULD CAN
Line_4661	PIEAPLE AND UM PEAPLE
Line_4662	UM WE CAN WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNES IT COULD'VE ANILL IT CHOUND IT
Line_4663	I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION RARING ABOUT
Line_4664	ALOUT OF PENIES UM THERE'S SOME PENIES AND THE THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOWING ON WATER
Line_4665	THEY REMIND ME OF LIKE THE PENIC BEING PACANGERS
Line_4666	I'ME WER REMINDING ABOUT HOW MANY PENIEYS WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT EXTINCTS
Line_4667	TEWIG CLOS UP  IT STINGS FASTUR BECAUSE
Line_4668	BECAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM HIGH
Line_4669	YOUR IT HAS LESS WEIGHT CIUM
Line_4670	HOW CAN UM CHACE ED IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM THE BIG ONES CARRY MORE BECAUSE FTH CU IT'S TALLER
Line_4671	THE TALLER ONE CAN CARRY MORE STH AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CARI CASE THAT  CAN SMALLER
Line_4672	BECAUSE IT'S SHORT END AND OUT AND TIT COULD JUMK
Line_4673	THINK IT'S PISHWY IT'S PICH LIKE THA  CAN LIKE THE KIND OF STRING YOU YOUSED TO CATCH PISH
Line_4674	P DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T LIKE A IN H STRING TO FIGNT IT
Line_4675	I DIDN'T REALLY SHOW YOU THAT TIME
Line_4676	YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON OM THE STRING YOU WOULD TA TO A CSHAIR THEN PUT THE ARO PLAIN AND SEE HOW MANY ONTS IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT PIGH
Line_4677	IT DIPS IN MORE AIR SOTT YOU CAN SO YOU CAN THEY CAN FLE FASTER
Line_4678	T HAT THE PREPELOAR IT WOULDN'T FLIGHT BECAUSE OU ATY UNET O SBINET AND THE BRUBER BAM WOULD HAVE NO WHERE TO UM TO
Line_4679	SHOAN THE CUMPITOR NICPED IT ABOUT LIKE TWENTY FIVE
Line_4680	MAKES THE BRA BAND TIGHTER
Line_4681	UM GET ONE END OF THE PRPELLA AND TO BUN AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
Line_4682	THERE ARE TWO AIR PLAINTS AND THERE AUN A STRING
Line_4683	ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S CENDLE CLING DOWN
Line_4684	IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FR THE THA FR THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GONG A NEED WEIGH MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
Line_4685	THE RIVER BENDS UM SWINGS LIKE TERALS AROUND UM THE PRPELLAR IS GOING SO YOU COAN' GET MORE AIR
Line_4686	THERE ARE TWO EIGH ATROPLANE UM THEIR CANDL
Line_4687	LAKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS ALITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS CANN LIKE HANGING IT ROUND LIKE NOT THAT TIGHT
Line_4688	THIS SGRAF IS ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLAINS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SIENCE
Line_4689	WELL IF I WAS GRAFFING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULOD
Line_4690	WELLIF HI CAN FLOWE DIN AND THE ROUT'S URAIN  ALWEYS
Line_4691	I WAS ABOUT SEYING HOW FAR I THE FLID IRTH WEL THE COURT WOULD GO
Line_4692	I PHOUGHT LIKE A WRAP ANEOR
Line_4693	I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ENS R FC LIKE E SNOW S
Line_4694	THEY WERE MAINING ABOUT  HOW YOU OD I THEAD TL IT CLSOE FASTER SLOWER MIXED
Line_4695	WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENJULUMS IND HOW THEY SQWEINING AND
Line_4696	THE GRALFT IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
Line_4697	THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
Line_4698	WITH THE PENDJULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT AREADY SWAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE A
Line_4699	YOU COULD SEE IF YOUR PRODICTIONS NOT THAT WELL WELL ANOTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN IT WIL
Line_4700	THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE FLAT THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
Line_4701	RUBER BAND IN IT JUST THE PREPELLAR BARL LEAVE AND SPIN WHENEVER I SAW THEM
Line_4702	IT IS A GRAF WITH AN EX AND WY AXIS
Line_4703	YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS ON THE WY AXIS AND THEN A DISTANCE IT WOULD GO ON THE EX AXIS
Line_4704	NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE EX AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASANGERS ON THE WY AXIS
Line_4705	THEY WOULD GO ON THE WI AXIS
Line_4706	THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU GATHERED H IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
Line_4707	WELL UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
Line_4708	WE DIDDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
Line_4709	THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
Line_4710	IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS OR THE MOTOR
Line_4711	WY AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
Line_4712	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
Line_4713	UM  I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO I EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
Line_4714	E'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENGULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRAND FATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
Line_4715	THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TIPE THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
Line_4716	IT MOVES AT ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECONDT GOES AND AFTER A WILE IT STARTS THE SLOW DOWN
Line_4717	IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSIT SIDE IT COMES BACK
Line_4718	IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
Line_4719	YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
Line_4720	TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
Line_4721	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLAINS THAT WE'HAVE MADE
Line_4722	UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
Line_4723	WHAT THEY ARE IS THEI'R CINAL LIKE CATTAPOULTS YOU PUSH DOWN
Line_4724	MA THE FOR
Line_4725	MAKE YOU ABLE TO SHOUT
Line_4726	NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
Line_4727	ERN WHAT I THINK IS THE HIRE THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOOT
Line_4728	IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES ALOT HIR THAN IT GOES FARTHER
Line_4729	THE THE STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WEY SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRITTY HARD
Line_4730	WELL THE FLIPERBACE IS WHERE YOULD PUT THE STICK AND THE CORK S YOULD PUT BOTH OF THEM IN
Line_4731	WELL THE LENGTTHS OF THE STICKS ARE EACH  CENTIMETER APART
Line_4732	HOW MUCH THE UM
Line_4733	RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGE IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
Line_4734	MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIER OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
Line_4735	UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPERPACE AND WITH SHOTING FLIPPERPACES WITH SHOOTING UM THINGS
Line_4736	IT WAS ON A PLASTICK ANGLE HOLDER
Line_4737	UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HIE IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTYEIT CENTIMETERS HIE
Line_4738	UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT AT ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
Line_4739	THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP UNE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
Line_4740	UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECTS
Line_4741	WE'VE BEEN CUDDYING PENGJULUMS AND TO DAY WE DID HELP DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
Line_4742	BEBECAUSE  I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HID A LOTCH LOT SHORTER STRING
Line_4743	IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK
Line_4744	THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4745	THIRTY CENTIMETERS
Line_4746	IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
Line_4747	YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS A GOOD ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY
Line_4748	AND STUDYING PENDULUMS
Line_4749	THEY KEEP TI AM KIND OF LIKE ON A GRAND FATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
Line_4750	WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
Line_4751	IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOULD THINK THE BOT
Line_4752	IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENTCS
Line_4753	IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOULD TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TINUBIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WAN TO BE AS ACCURAT AS YOU CAN
Line_4754	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFE BOTS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
Line_4755	OU AREADY ASK ME THAT QUESTION
Line_4756	WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOT
Line_4757	YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE SOME OTHER TIME
Line_4758	IF YOU DON'T DO A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
Line_4759	I DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE IT WASN'T HERE ON THIRSDY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
Line_4760	IF YOU PUT IT IN TWO HARD IT MIGHT THINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
Line_4761	IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WULD SINK ERLLIER THAN USUWAL
Line_4762	WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLAINS
Line_4763	THE HIERE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT
Line_4764	HE HIER OR THE MORE PASANGERS IT CAN CARRY
Line_4765	VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAFED ABOUT THEM
Line_4766	THE WIE LING WAS WHERE WE PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSANGERS AND THE EX LIGNE WAS WHERE WE
Line_4767	THE MORE PASANGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
Line_4768	THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PACANGERS IT COULD HOL
Line_4769	EX IS THE CAMPACITY OF THE BOT IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT IT AND THEN THE
Line_4770	NO BECAUSE IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES
Line_4771	WENTY FI IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PACANGERS THAT CANT BE RIGHT
Line_4772	IS ANY ONE THERE
Line_4773	I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
Line_4774	HERE'S A PENY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND THE PAPER CLIP AND A STRING
Line_4775	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4776	MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWING FASTER
Line_4777	IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT CAN GET  THE UH THE MORE TIMES TWO
Line_4778	THE STRING THE PAPER CLIP THE PENY AND THE PENCIL
Line_4779	UH THE STOING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
Line_4780	THE  ALL SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4781	HOW FAST THE PENY USE GO BACK AND FORTH
Line_4782	THE SHORTER IT IS THE  FASTERITAL SWING SIDEWAYS
Line_4783	STUDYING UH THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
Line_4784	UH SWINGING SIDEWAYS
Line_4785	THERE'S A PENY CONNECTED TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_4786	ITCH HANGING FROM A TABLE
Line_4787	WE SWUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES OE COULD SWING BACK IND FORTY FIFIN FIFTEEN SECUONDS
Line_4788	IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4789	OUH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
Line_4790	BECAUSE UH IF MAYBE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
Line_4791	THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4792	IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID UT THE LAST STARING POSITION
Line_4793	NO THAT'S IT
Line_4794	I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTH
Line_4795	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATPOULEDS
Line_4796	UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
Line_4797	AND A FLIPPER BACE
Line_4798	UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE CWICK GOES AFTER YOU LAUNCH IT
Line_4799	THEY MAKE THE CORC U LIKE SLI
Line_4800	UH I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LANCHED THE CORT
Line_4801	YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO  LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIRST STICK
Line_4802	THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CWICK WAS LANCHED
Line_4803	HOW FAR YOU CAN WACH THE CORK
Line_4804	FROM THE HEIGHT I LAUNCHED IT FROM UH I THINK MAYBE IT WILL GO FARTHER
Line_4805	I NOTICE THAT THE SHORTER THE STICKS IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
Line_4806	UND THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENET FIRTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
Line_4807	U THE WAIT OF THE CLORK MAKES THEM DIFFERENT
Line_4808	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENJUUMS
Line_4809	IT MAKES THE PENY AND THE IT MAKES THE PENY SWING BACK AND FORTH
Line_4810	IF IT SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
Line_4811	IT'S U DRAF TO SEE HOW LONG THE PENDULNES
Line_4812	IT LOOKS LIKE A GRASS FROM THE H BIGEST TO THE LITTLEST
Line_4813	SO WHEN YOU MAKE A ESTIMATE IS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
Line_4814	I THINK IT'S ABOUT SUBTRACTING
Line_4815	IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGE IS GETTING  LOWER
Line_4816	UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
Line_4817	UH I FORGET
Line_4818	UH S I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENY AND IT'L STOOLL IN THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
Line_4819	UM I THINK SO YOU COULDN'T SEE YOUR RESULTS
Line_4820	UH WE DID U STUFF ABOUT BOTS AND HOW MANY PENIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
Line_4821	UM SO THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4822	UH I DON'T FROM I DON'T REMEMBER
Line_4823	UH PENIES ARE LIKE PACANGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4824	WELL UH IF THERE IS MORE PENIES ON ONE SIDE AND THON ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
Line_4825	SOME ONE'S DROPING MORE PENIES IN TO THE BOT
Line_4826	MAKE SHOORE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BU
Line_4827	BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BAOLANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
Line_4828	IT'S TELLING ME A GRALF ABOUT UH BOTS
Line_4829	ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
Line_4830	UH IF I CHANGE YOUR BUNCHER THINGSIT
Line_4831	I IT WOULD LIKE SINK
Line_4832	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIEABLES
Line_4833	THAT'S HOW MANY PACANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4834	I FIGURED OUT THAT UH THE BIGGER THELE LIFE BUBS THE MORE PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4835	HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOT IS
Line_4836	IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PENIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOT
Line_4837	A IS THE BIGGEST SO IT'LL HOLD MORE PASANGERS
Line_4838	IF YOU STACK UP THE PENIES IT CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PACANGERS
Line_4839	WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY U OF THE BOT WHICH IS MIL
Line_4840	UH WELL THE SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST TO LETEST OR LEIATEST LEAST TO GREATEST
Line_4841	WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
Line_4842	I SEE THATAT THE NUMBERS RIZSING UP
Line_4843	THE EX ACT SEYS IS THE WHERE THE CAPACITY MILLAMETERS ARE
Line_4844	UH UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PACANGERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
Line_4845	THE EX AXCESS IS AT THE BOTTOME OF THE SCREEN AND THE WYE AXCESS IS ON SO TO THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
Line_4846	THE WIE AXCESS SHOWS HOW MANY PASANGERS THERE ARE
Line_4847	THE WY AXCESS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
Line_4848	WELL ON EVERY BOT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALL OR PENIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOT
Line_4849	WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO WHOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4850	I NOTICED THAT THE THE UMBER OF THE CAMPACON THE PACANGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GROUEW
Line_4851	IT ETHER GOT THE PASANGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT T SMALLER OR BIGGER
Line_4852	WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH TO THE DIFFERENCIS AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
Line_4853	WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOTORS THE RIVER BANDS AND WHY IS THA DISTANCE
Line_4854	MANDS UHL GO PRITY FAR
Line_4855	WERLL IT'S PLACED LIKE ON THE OTHER SIDE O WILL BE EAZIEA LIST
Line_4856	WELL YOU PLAC THE WY THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF TERT AND THEN IT'LL BEIT'LL BE LIKE GOING THERE SO EV IT'S EASIER
Line_4857	WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RIBER BANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASANGERS OR MEAN MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
Line_4858	WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASANGERS THE DISTANCE WEALL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
Line_4859	A FEW DAYS AGO WE LITTLE PAPER EAROPLINS
Line_4860	UM WE MADE  PHENY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENE
Line_4861	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'E CHANGED TO MANY THINGS
Line_4862	HOW MANY TIMES THE PENTOULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
Line_4863	SOMETHING SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
Line_4864	THEY BOTH HAVE A PENY AT THE END
Line_4865	IF IT SHORTER IT WILL GO FATSLOWER
Line_4866	IF YOU CHANGED TWOO MANY VERIBLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CAME TO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
Line_4867	THEY'R NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENAND A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
Line_4868	THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONDRER THE LATTER TIME
Line_4869	THE SHORTER IT GETS AFAT THE MORE SWINGS IT THAIT TAKES
Line_4870	ECTUALLY THE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SLINGS HAS
Line_4871	UM LETS SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS A SHORTER ONE
Line_4872	IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRANGI IS TTHE HUTAIR THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
Line_4873	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PRODICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE SLIPPER AND THE ANSHEARE OF THE SLIPPER
Line_4874	WELL THAT'S PRITY MUCH OF WHAT WE DIS SO FIGN WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO MOROW
Line_4875	WELL WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CORK AND THEN WE'RE GONG TO LOUNCH  AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR AIL WILL GO
Line_4876	U THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPISE THE CORK IS WHERE ORGANA LAUNCH AND THEN THE ROVER SOPPER HELPS HSTICK UP AND THE
Line_4877	A I'M NOT SHURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
Line_4878	UM PROBABLY THE  SLIPPER BASE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOULDS IT UP AND THE RUBER STOP
Line_4879	CAN YOU SHOW ME A PIXTURE OF THE FLIPPER
Line_4880	YEAH THE WEIGHT MY UM AFECTS HOW FAR IT GOS
Line_4881	YEAH WILL POLVERY TRIA AND HO ON THEOS TO MOROW
Line_4882	OR WELL WE MAKE EITHER A GRAS OROR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A CHART
Line_4883	AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER CA IT CAN IP IT BEFORE IT GOES OVER
Line_4884	UM IT WAS IMPORTAT TO MIXTURE THERE IS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENIES
Line_4885	THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEYL WEILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENIES
Line_4886	HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BUT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
Line_4887	IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE SOME IT MIYGHT HAVE BEABLE TO HOLD MORE
Line_4888	UN WHAT'SAY
Line_4889	IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT YOU NO MAKE IT SINK
Line_4890	IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDL THEI'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SENCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM CANA EVERYWAYL SINK FASTER
Line_4891	WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT A
Line_4892	UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT A HOLD AS MUCH PENIES BECAUSE THEY NOT AS TALLER AND IT WLL OVER FLOW FASTER
Line_4893	ONECE ABOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSANGERS YOUR BOAGT CAN HOLD
Line_4894	YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVER FLOW THE BOUT
Line_4895	IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE FTHAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER
Line_4896	IF YOU WOULD SAY UN
Line_4897	ECAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T WOULDN' KNOW IF YOU KNO OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OP R LESS
Line_4898	LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS
Line_4899	NO IF THEY ARE RONG OR RIGHT
Line_4900	YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU ACK UM ONE ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO THINK IF YOU STUCK UM IN THE MIDDL LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT ITWLL STAY UP LONGER
Line_4901	WELL YOU SHOULD BRON
Line_4902	IF YOU DON'T USE ACCORM MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIT CENTIME
Line_4903	SONG OF STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONES SOPOSE TO BE EAIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE ILL UNDE BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
Line_4904	ES I CEE UM WHERE'S
Line_4905	THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT WITH PENIES AND THEN THE MEDIAM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
Line_4906	WE MAIDE FOR PAPER BLTS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATERS THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENIES IT CAN HOLD
Line_4907	WE MUST WE SEE HOW MUCH CAPACITY THIT CAN HOLD HOW MANY PENIES THIT COULD HOULT
Line_4908	TO HOLD PENIES AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WAIDER IT COULD HOLD
Line_4909	WE MADE FORE DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH Y NO
Line_4910	IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEYL HOLD MORE
Line_4911	THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
Line_4912	HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL A BUT IS
Line_4913	U DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU CETTALM IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE
Line_4914	IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE I'LL THINK BUT IF YOU PUT T IN THE MIDDL THEY'LL STAK EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4915	IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SCIDEL THINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
Line_4916	IF THE WATER I'S TO RUFF THE BOT COULDN'T TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S COM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENI'S IN IT WILL STAY UP
Line_4917	THE THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
Line_4918	IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE HEM SMALLER A BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
Line_4919	THAT UN WE K
Line_4920	ACITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
Line_4921	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER VOTS AND SEING THE CAPACITY AN HOW MUCH PACANGERS THEY CAN HOLD AN WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAS
Line_4922	WELL WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
Line_4923	WELL THE SMALLER THE BOT IS THE LESS PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLT
Line_4924	WELL THEY'RE PUTTING HER IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HELP MORE BUT IF YOU PUT THEM ALL TO THE SIDEIL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
Line_4925	WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSANGERS IT CAN HOLT
Line_4926	IT'S CAPACITIES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
Line_4927	WELL IT DEPENDS OF THE SIZE OF THE BOT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AN HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAUND IT COULD HOLD
Line_4928	WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND
Line_4929	THAT  THE CAPACITY GETS HIRE SO IT IS THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS
Line_4930	THAT N THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PACANGERS
Line_4931	HIERE IT GETS MORE PACANGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
Line_4932	U I SO ITS
Line_4933	THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY  CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PACANGERS IT CAN HOLD
Line_4934	UM WE COULD SEE HOW WE COULD WHEN WE SP HOW FAR IT COULD GO
Line_4935	IS THAT YOU YOUHAVE THE PREPELAR AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS A PREPELAR UP AND THEN YOU
Line_4936	BODY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLAT
Line_4937	WELL YOU NEED THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPRED PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT CINA STREEM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU U WINED UP THE PERPELLAR
Line_4938	WELL MEAN MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING IN THAE AND ND WE LEARN THAT IF YOU PUT A THA IN IT
Line_4939	EFFECTS HOW MU IT CAN FLI
Line_4940	WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLAR AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
Line_4941	WELL WE ADDED TO EVERY TIME SO TWO FORY SIX AIT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
Line_4942	WELL WE FIGGER IT OUT THE MORE PAPER ECLIPS IT HAS TO THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO S LONG
Line_4943	IT WILL MAKE THE PLAIN GOS SLOWER AND IT WILL GO LES FAR
Line_4944	WELL IF WE DID MORE WIGNES IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESIURE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
Line_4945	WELL MORE THE LESS PASSANGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSANGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO LESS FAR
Line_4946	WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT EFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
Line_4947	WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF THAT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKE IT BETTER
Line_4948	WELL YOU CAN FIGER IT OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE
Line_4949	ELL IT'S LIKE YOU TICK OFF ONE OF THE OF THES STRAWS AND WHI YOU FETCH THE PLAIN
Line_4950	WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLAINS AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
Line_4951	I NOTICE THAT WITH UMOGAN WITH
Line_4952	MORE WITH MORE PASS AS YOU ADD MORE PASANGERS THE LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
Line_4953	PROABLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ARE AROUND THAT
Line_4954	THE NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RUBBER BANDS
Line_4955	THE DISTANCE GOES HIER
Line_4956	YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PASCIJE AND AS YOU GO
Line_4957	THAT'S WHAT I DID N MYTA
Line_4958	WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS  TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
Line_4959	WE SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
Line_4960	WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DESCK AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPED THEM
Line_4961	WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN JUST LIKE GO OF THEM IT COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
Line_4962	WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
Line_4963	I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TRO O YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
Line_4964	THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THEM
Line_4965	SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4966	UM I STINK SO THEN YOU
Line_4967	AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_4968	THE FLIPP STICK ANDS
Line_4969	IT SHOWES HOW MANY CENTIMAN ITERS SO AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMITERS
Line_4970	I SEE WHENE Y UM CLICK IT'S GOING FORTHE
Line_4971	YOU COULD CHANGE ELOF THINGS WHAT E EXPELMENT IT MADERS WHETHER IT IS
Line_4972	WARMTH ANG YEA TIME
Line_4973	BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE AOFF THINGS ILL THE EXPILIMENT MIGHT BE RONG AND YOU'LL NOT SHOW IF I NOT
Line_4974	IT DEFFECTS THE WILLE DISSULT BECAUSE YOUH YOAH
Line_4975	IT TOOK ALF SHOVELEIGNE
Line_4976	IT'S COUNTNENT BY TENT UM IT'S MOVINGN U BY CEMLIMIETARS
Line_4977	IT'S GAYING HIER AND HIER
Line_4978	WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZE PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
Line_4979	THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE STRING
Line_4980	SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
Line_4981	THAT YOU ONLY CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
Line_4982	WE UM MEASURE IT UNDUH
Line_4983	UM MEASURING TAPE
Line_4984	WE CEP THE PENY AN THE PAPER CLIP THE SAME AND THE LOP THE SAME
Line_4985	THEY FLOW IN THE OTION AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSANGERS AND SOMETIMES IMERGENCY LUGAGE
Line_4986	FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE DROEUW A CROSS
Line_4987	WE BILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUP CUPS
Line_4988	IT WAS IMPORTANCE SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENIES IT COULD HOLD
Line_4989	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE SIZE
Line_4990	SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGED
Line_4991	WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PAOINIES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACMENTS
Line_4992	IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIDE THE PLACE MENT OR THE UM AWAY THE WATER MOVES
Line_4993	THINK YOU VERY MUCH MARNEY
Line_4994	I'M FINE HOW ARE YOU
Line_4995	I FIGURE TAUM I DON'T KNOW WHAT VALUTE FARRIABULES ARE
Line_4996	WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
Line_4997	I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
Line_4998	WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOTS WERE
Line_4999	HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WEIGHT
Line_5000	WE DID BIE US DOING EVERYTHING ITH EVERYBODTY BAKING THEIR BOTS PRITTY MUCH ALWEXACTLY THE SAME
Line_5001	TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
Line_5002	YOU COULN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
Line_5003	THE WY AXIS IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PASANGERS THE BOT CAN HOLD
Line_5004	HOW MANY WHAT FART THEY CALL INE
Line_5005	WHICH WORDS
Line_5006	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
Line_5007	HOW WAR YOU BULLS CHANGE THINGS
Line_5008	THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS BIGGER
Line_5009	S THE CAPACITY OF THE BOT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PACANGERS GETS SMALLER TWO SO PRITY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
Line_5010	WELL BY MARNE HAVE A NICE STICK
Line_5011	HH MY NAME IS CAHER AND I AM NIN EARS OLD WE USE HOMLEY A QUESTION
Line_5012	CARPAPHNIA MEASUREMENT DECLINE AND SOMIT
Line_5013	OLL ABOUT HEIGHT A I FORGOT
Line_5014	I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
Line_5015	A YARD STICK A ROULER   A METER STICK
Line_5016	HEY ARE TWOBS
Line_5017	AND TALL AND AND TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
Line_5018	WELL UHM I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5019	H I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
Line_5020	DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU
Line_5021	I YOU O NERALLWE
Line_5022	THE DOORNB ON THE PIXTURE
Line_5023	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEAED THEM
Line_5024	I FORGOT SORY
Line_5025	I SWEE ONE METER TEN METER A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
Line_5026	OU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WITH OR HOW LONG IT IS
Line_5027	SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN ROULRS
Line_5028	A DAORNB MEAN  A NOB ON A DOOWORK
Line_5029	YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A ROULER
Line_5030	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5031	YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HEAB
Line_5032	AND WHEN YOU ESTIMATE YOU CAN UM ESTIMATE A LOT AND YOU CAN ESTIMATE LIKE BUBLS YOU CAN ESTIMATE ANYTHING
Line_5033	IT IS TEN SATTANLEYE AND ARS UM IN THIS PICTURE
Line_5034	ALLOWS HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS ALL IN ALL
Line_5035	THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
Line_5036	IT IS BIGGER THAN A WOALER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE MORE US MOST MORE COMAN
Line_5037	THIS BOY IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
Line_5038	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
Line_5039	OH WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS YARDS AND FEET
Line_5040	I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5041	A MADE OR TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABY SO YOU CAND MEASURE UNDER NECK
Line_5042	THEY ARE BOTH THE UM
Line_5043	SOM ARE THE SAME WINK
Line_5044	YOU CAN USE A HANDOR YOU COALD USE A RULER OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
Line_5045	YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
Line_5046	YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN METER STICKS AND ROULERS
Line_5047	I DID NOT NOW
Line_5048	YOU CAN WEIGH IN THEM WITH THE SKILYOU
Line_5049	I DO NOT THE WHOLE
Line_5050	WELL THERE WEAIGHTS THAT AR A LIGKE CAOMLE WHAT A BEAST LIGHT IS
Line_5051	IS HEAVIER THAN CHIP
Line_5052	METAL WIGHES HEAVIER THAN CLASS VOYAING ANS
Line_5053	WELL THE FIRST THE HEAVIEST WIS THE EDGE OF THE MAGNET THEN THE THEN WOODN'T AND THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE JU
Line_5054	I DON' WAN'T HOLD THE ANSWER IS  O I LIKE QUESTION
Line_5055	WELL IF SOMETHING FALANSED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS OR THAT  YOULD SEE THEN  T MAKE IT MEASURED WITH THEG SO IT'S A LITLR METAL
Line_5056	THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THE CHIP
Line_5057	BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAIY TO BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
Line_5058	WELL THE PICTURE SHO ME THAT NOT THE MITTAL WASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
Line_5059	WELL YOU COULOD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
Line_5060	WL UM IT'S MORE ACURENT
Line_5061	WOUND IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT L METTAL
Line_5062	WEL MEASUREING IT'S SOLY BUT WEL I FORGET NOT
Line_5063	WE SED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
Line_5064	THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
Line_5065	WELL A SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE IN AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
Line_5066	ONE PAPER CLIPS SMALL ONE PAPER CUPS BICK
Line_5067	WELL THEY PROBABLY ON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HAPPIEST AND ONE'S NOT HEAVIN
Line_5068	THE LITTLE CLUB IN FROM  ME AND IT EQUALES ONE GRAM
Line_5069	YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS ORE GRAMS ALL WILL WEIGH UNTILL INCINEITY
Line_5070	I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
Line_5071	IN THIS PIXCTURE TAKES A GRAMS TO FILL UP THAT METALE WASHER
Line_5072	ON SEVEND SIX FIVE MORE THREE TO ONE THEN THE METAL WASHER GETS HEAVIER AND GRAMS
Line_5073	WELL IT WILL BE BAUN
Line_5074	WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE RAM TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
Line_5075	MELL WH GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5076	OKA UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
Line_5077	UH UH I DO NOT KNOW
Line_5078	I DO H TRUM YEW AND MEE  THEY FHAUGHT ME GOODARY
Line_5079	I DON'T KNA EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERANCEES WHA IT M
Line_5080	WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
Line_5081	THESE ARE GRAMS
Line_5082	IT IS EIHT GRAMS
Line_5083	IT TAKE SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TO MEASURE THAT CHRRAND KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
Line_5084	H UH U O IDOM'S NOT NO
Line_5085	THE ORANGE IS TWO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO TO MAKE IT BALANCED
Line_5086	A THOUSED GRAMS EQUAL ONE KILGRAM
Line_5087	WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVEN USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE A KILOGRAM
Line_5088	UM WHAT  I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SCINENCE
Line_5089	WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
Line_5090	MEASURE MAIGMASURE MEN
Line_5091	WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WE'VE BEEN MEASUREING
Line_5092	ALLWAY'S A MATERLE AROH IUM MEAN MEASURING
Line_5093	THREE CORTS OF WATER AUND MAYBE
Line_5094	WELL THERE'S LINES AND M  THAT COULD PROBABLY TELL MEA HOW MUCH IT COULD   HOLD
Line_5095	EVILE TO COULD HOLD LESS AND BY A ONE COULD HOLD A MORE LIKE TWISE THAT MUCH A BILE TWO
Line_5096	WEL THAT VILE COULD PO GROUP
Line_5097	BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET TO HUNT THERSULTS THATWAY
Line_5098	WELL THIS WATER 'S HOLDING A THOUSAND NIWALITORS OR ONE ONLY KILOGRAM
Line_5099	UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH ICAN
Line_5100	I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER
Line_5101	THAT SHOWES IS ONE MILLILITER
Line_5102	UMU MILLIITERS HO SHOWN'T A HOLD AR HOW IT COULD BE WITH THE LINES
Line_5103	FIRST ONE A HUNDRED MILLITES AND THE BIG FAT TWO BE THING THOUSAND MILLOMITERS
Line_5104	TAKES TEN LITTLE TWO BES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILL ETER
Line_5105	WHEN YOU BAKE A CICK YOU CAN USE MILLLITERS
Line_5106	UM WEL I FORGOT
Line_5107	MILLOMETER IS BIGGER AND A LITER IS SNAWLE
Line_5108	YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
Line_5109	BECAUSE IT HAS FEUWNAL INCHES NILLMETERS OR LITERS
Line_5110	THEY COULD HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
Line_5111	WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE BLACK THING OUT

Line_5292	S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLINLITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHEAT THAT'S SHOWING
Line_5293	UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINES AN THE CUP
Line_5294	UM ONES TO DM ONES TO D
Line_5295	IT CONTAINES UM
Line_5296	UM SAY YOU HAD GRAVEL AND A BIGGER THAN YOU COULD USE THAT
Line_5297	COULD USE A SORINCE YOU COULD BUY SORENDER IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL IT UP TO
Line_5298	IT I FORGOT HOW D PT I FORGOT
Line_5299	WELL IF SOMETHING TALLER BUT SKINIER AND IF SOMETHING SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHATEVER
Line_5300	IT WILL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM
Line_5301	THEY WE ARE ITHER TALLER BUT SKINIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
Line_5302	IT GETS COLDER
Line_5303	IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZEROW
Line_5304	ONE MINET SALL IT TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
Line_5305	IT GOES UP WHEN THITER DON'T WHAT ELSE COALA
Line_5306	IT GOT REALLY COLDER IT GOT TWENTY DEGREYES COLDER
Line_5307	LIKE UM GO DOWN AND UM TOP
Line_5308	U I ON'T STAND TYEAH
Line_5309	WELL SO I AM GOING TO MAKE IT REPEETE
Line_5310	I NEED STAREBOYS FIRST SECE
Line_5311	UM IT CHANGED RILLY QUICKLY I YEA
Line_5312	WE DREUGH IT ON GRAS PAPER
Line_5313	YOU HAVE O UM
Line_5314	LL EXIS OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
Line_5315	WELL YOU PUT ON TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Line_5316	IT GOES UPUPHTHEWEY
Line_5317	IT'S TIME HOW MUCH A TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
Line_5318	OKAY AM GOOD
Line_5319	IT IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
Line_5320	GOES WE AND IT UP
Line_5321	IT GOT IT WAS STUED AT TWEMTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
Line_5322	YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MASHIGHT GUESS BY FIVE I
Line_5323	JUST LIKE OWMING BY TONS OR FIFTEEN
Line_5324	IT GOES UP IF ITS WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IT FITS HOTTER
Line_5325	THE UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
Line_5326	THEY ARE DIFFERENT UHM TEMPERATURES
Line_5327	THE TEMPERATURE AND THE UM
Line_5328	COULD BIE AM REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT FIN
Line_5329	HOLOW MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
Line_5330	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH ROULERS YARD STICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
Line_5331	LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS YOUSUALLY
Line_5332	WE'RE MEASURING UM OUR DISCK AND WE HAD TO FIGGER OUT THE PEARRIMETER
Line_5333	I USED A YARD STICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DESCK
Line_5334	YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH THOSE AND I THINK THERE STRAWS
Line_5335	SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
Line_5336	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'S THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5337	A METER STICK OR A YOUD STICK OR A RULER THEY'E ALL THE SAME SIZE
Line_5338	IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
Line_5339	IT IS ELEVEAN NO IT IS TEN THAT DECIMETERS
Line_5340	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS AND A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DE DECIMETERS AND A METER ALSO
Line_5341	THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
Line_5342	ONE THOUSAND METERS
Line_5343	WE MEASURED THE COMPCAPACITY OF A CUP
Line_5344	WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUPCU
Line_5345	HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE CAMPACITY
Line_5346	WE USED UMTHE COUMPACITY
Line_5347	YOU COULD PORIT AND A DIFFERENT COPPER A GRAJUTATED SILINDER OR SOMETHING
Line_5348	THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLALITERS IT'S HOLDING
Line_5349	THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLAN MILLILITERS
Line_5350	IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5351	IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PRMCH
Line_5352	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPAC CAPACITY OF SOMETHING OF A CUP R A WATER BOTTL OR SOMETHING
Line_5353	VECUP THE CAMPACITY OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5354	OU SHOLD MEASURE ALL THE WATER AND THE CUP
Line_5355	IT'S YOUOR IT'S HO IT'S THE FOUL AMOUNT OF A CUP
Line_5356	THOSE ARE VESSILS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THERT ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND CAPACITY
Line_5357	THAT TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5358	IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
Line_5359	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE CAMPACITY OF BOTTLES AND CANS
Line_5360	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER
Line_5361	CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
Line_5362	WE HAD TO FIGR OUT HOW MUCH CAM WHAT THE CAPACITY OF A SODA CAN WAS
Line_5363	THAT'S PROBABLY THE CAMPACITY OF THE CAN
Line_5364	THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE RMANS THAT THAT CAND OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
Line_5365	IT'S THE THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITER DIFFERENT IT'S NOT RIGHT
Line_5366	THE VOLLIUME AND THE CAPACITY  THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS AE DIFFERENT
Line_5367	THE COMPACITY IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLLIUME
Line_5368	YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF A CAN
Line_5369	THE COMPACITY OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
Line_5370	THE NUMBER IS THE VOLIUME OF THE CUP
Line_5371	THE STANDARD UNIT IS LEATERS AND THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLLITERS
Line_5372	UT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED SILANDER
Line_5373	IT'S LAIBULED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
Line_5374	YOU WOULD UDD UP THE THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THOT YOU HAVE
Line_5375	UM ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THAT S
Line_5376	AFTER WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINIT
Line_5377	IF THE RED UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'SGETTING WARN
Line_5378	THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOUME AND HOW MANY HAVE UM UP AND DOWN
Line_5379	IT DROPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE AND JUST A MINNET
Line_5380	I WOULD DESCRIBE IT SUP HIHE AND THEN IT GOES  PRITY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIERE AND HIERE AND HIRER
Line_5381	THEN IT SLOWLEAM MAKES IT SWAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRASS AND IT GETS WAMER
Line_5382	I NOTICE THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
Line_5383	IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FOLY GO UP AGAIN
Line_5384	ARS IT WENT FROM TWENTY  THE WEIT TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
Line_5385	THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THE HOTTEST
Line_5386	WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THING AND LEANGTHS AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
Line_5387	ONE WAS COALED AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO AND THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
Line_5388	HE 'S TRYING TO FIGGER OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST PTRUMWS IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMAST
Line_5389	TO FIGGER OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
Line_5390	BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
Line_5391	WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
Line_5392	THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Line_5393	WELL THERE IS THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
Line_5394	WELL IT SEAMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINES SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SID
Line_5395	GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINEST SIDE UM THROUGES A LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND ITS
Line_5396	UM NO WSTHOP
Line_5397	FHE WIRES ARE A SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING THE COLLAGE SORT OF LIKE A HIGH WAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK IT DOWN AGAIN
Line_5398	UM AH HI WAIGHT FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5399	IT CONNECTS TWO TWO WIRES CIRCUIT S THINK II JUST
Line_5400	WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
Line_5401	WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRES COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER AND
Line_5402	UM ACTUALLY NO I W'S JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT ARIA WHERE THE NOCHES ARE
Line_5403	WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME OF
Line_5404	WELL PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CIERTAIN TIPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
Line_5405	I THINK PARALLELL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
Line_5406	IS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
Line_5407	UM WHEN ONME BULB BRUPS OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY DOTH FLOW THROUGH
Line_5408	MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
Line_5409	I THINK IT COULD BE BULS ACTUALLY
Line_5410	UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
Line_5411	WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
Line_5412	WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND THE THE NAIL DID
Line_5413	AWATHE TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
Line_5414	YEAH SOME TIMES
Line_5415	THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP
Line_5416	AND THE ROCK THE STEEL ROCK
Line_5417	YEAH SOME OF THEM STICK  WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON VIRELANS STICK BUT SOME DIDN'T
Line_5418	WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STEEL LIKE THAT YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THE WOUOD
Line_5419	IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWERE IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
Line_5420	IT DIDN'T OWAYS STICK ALL TIMES BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
Line_5421	WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
Line_5422	NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING CAN STAY LIKE THAT ITS OONG'S A MAGNET
Line_5423	IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
Line_5424	YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
Line_5425	OH THAT THE NE HELP JUST PINA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
Line_5426	E OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
Line_5427	THEY ARE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
Line_5428	THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CART BORB IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS STICK
Line_5429	WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
Line_5430	WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO WELL
Line_5431	WELL UM THE BATTERY
Line_5432	IT'S HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FOULE THING
Line_5433	BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS ON
Line_5434	WE MADE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5435	IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY TH WOUN'T PICK UP ANY OUED KNOW THAT IT WOULN'T BE WORKING
Line_5436	YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKIN SO I THINK IT JUST RIGHT
Line_5437	MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH THE
Line_5438	THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH
Line_5439	IT IS THE ELECELECTRICITY IS THE THING THAT THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
Line_5440	IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
Line_5441	IT WILL NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
Line_5442	WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START  START RUNNING
Line_5443	WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENUGH POWER THAT ITI'LL STARK GOING
Line_5444	HE POWER IS LIKE SCENS YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
Line_5445	THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOL MOTOR WON'T START WORKING
Line_5446	WELL THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE IF
Line_5447	THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
Line_5448	MIN'S PLACED AND ONE PART OF AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WHEIRE ON THE PUS PLACE SO IT'LL STEELL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
Line_5449	ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT IN
Line_5450	TO DAY I MADE POSTERS PECE POSTERS
Line_5451	THEY WE'RE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPER AND THE MIDDL AND THE MAGNET BILOW
Line_5452	UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
Line_5453	YES WE TRYIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS UN UN THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
Line_5454	IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY AND THE IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONE
Line_5455	YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRACHING
Line_5456	TO DAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PIEECE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PIEECE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THOS OTHER STUFF
Line_5457	YES AND WARE IS BAD TO BUT PIECE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE MADE PPOSTERS OUT FOR PIEACE
Line_5458	WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
Line_5459	BECAUSE IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS YOU THE IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
Line_5460	AS IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THAT ENERGY WOULDN'T GULD THROUGH SO THE LIGHT BULB U LIGHT
Line_5461	ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL OR THE ELECT ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
Line_5462	IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
Line_5463	YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU'RE PUTING IT ON A BAT THE BA WON'T WORK
Line_5464	FROM THE MINES
Line_5465	OH SINCE ICK CLICK DOWN THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSIT WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
Line_5466	WELL E I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
Line_5467	S OR Y B OR SE D YEA
Line_5468	WE HAVE A BA RE WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB WITH THE LIGHT BULB CA
Line_5469	AND AND B ANND AFTER YOU WERE DON WITH THAT WE HAD WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
Line_5470	MOST REACENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAGMAGNETISM
Line_5471	WE'VE BEEN MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR THE LAST THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCIENCE WE
Line_5472	WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPINGE
Line_5473	A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHT BULB
Line_5474	IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
Line_5475	OH THE UM THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BLIT UP MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE WAS ONE D CELL
Line_5476	BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE S D CELLS
Line_5477	WE HAVE MADE DIRGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DUNING CLASS
Line_5478	THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAS PLACE TO GO
Line_5479	HE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRES AND THE BATTERY
Line_5480	HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT UP
Line_5481	BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
Line_5482	THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWIN TO THE RIGHT
Line_5483	THE WAY THAT IS GOING OUT OF ITS NEGATIVE SIDE AND IS GOING IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5484	ELECTRICAL CURRENT WOULD GOING UP IN THE OPPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5485	MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICALS CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE LAU NO IT'S THE FLOW TWOS THE LEST
Line_5486	WE PUT UM IN THE CUPS EITHER BY DROPING THEM FAR OR WE DROPED THEM ON THE RIMATY CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
Line_5487	TILL A CIRTY AMOUNT  WEIGHT
Line_5488	MONAWEIGHT BREAKES THE MAGNETIC WEAIVE AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE PLASTIC QUATER THEY CALLED
Line_5489	THE MAGNETIC WEAIVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE I DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS AND BETWEEN
Line_5490	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5491	SWITCH TURN THE ELECTRO MAGNET ON THS
Line_5492	UM I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
Line_5493	THE MORE WINES IT HAS U THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE MORE THE ELECTRO MAGNET THE MORE POWURFUL ELECTRO MAGNET IS
Line_5494	BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY AND THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT THE ELECTRO MAGNETS STRONGER
Line_5495	IT IT BUSED EST AND AND THE POLIVIT SPUN AROUND AND SO CELSE
Line_5496	UM WHEN YOU CLOSED A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN AFF THE LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ARMAL LIGHT
Line_5497	A BATTERY IS CONNECTED TOE MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5498	THERE IS A SWITCH ON IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TUN ON ENNUFF
Line_5499	ENERGY E FOE IT CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTORVE OR LIGHT RUN
Line_5500	A BATTERY IS  CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TONT ON
Line_5501	IT FLOWES FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE END AND GOES MTO AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULP
Line_5502	UM ONE  TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TWO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
Line_5503	U IT MAKES IT SO YOUH THAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
Line_5504	THE WINDED ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT IN A CIRCL
Line_5505	WE RUBD A PACLIP ON A MAGNET THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
Line_5506	THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPERCLIP
Line_5507	UM IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
Line_5508	IF YOU CANPICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETICK
Line_5509	UM IF YOU NEED TO MEE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL AL TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
Line_5510	WITH A REGUMAGNET YOU CANT DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT A DROP YOU HAVEN TO PULL IT OFF
Line_5511	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHE AST THOLD US BUT  YEAH
Line_5512	WELL THERE IS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES A LIGHT UP
Line_5513	I THINK THAT IT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
Line_5514	UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS  I I JUST DON'T THINK IT WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
Line_5515	WELL AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAT SICK
Line_5516	IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FAST TO ME
Line_5517	YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE THE THE OPOSIT DIRECTION THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSIT WAY
Line_5518	WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
Line_5519	ECAUSE IT'S TILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSIT DIRECTION
Line_5520	UM  WOULD DO EXACTLY MEAN
Line_5521	UM LIKE I SAID IT JUTSWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTORS FLAT RUNS
Line_5522	INSTED OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT'LL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
Line_5523	BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WEIGHT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOUR SWITCH THE BMATTRARY AND THE MOTOR
Line_5524	WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEAIT TILL IT LIFT THE MAGNETS APPART
Line_5525	WI YOU WON'T DO IT LIKE GONE
Line_5526	WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
Line_5527	WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
Line_5528	WELL THIS IS UR WHAT THEY CALLED IT
Line_5529	WEIY WHAT'S A GALLED THE BOLK PARA
Line_5530	WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP
Line_5531	WELL DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
Line_5532	UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
Line_5533	THIS IS THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5534	AND  THE OTHER LIGHT BUBLE CILL KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
Line_5535	IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
Line_5536	UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT'S TO D NEAIBLE HEARD WEAR A SELARATION
Line_5537	WELL I THINK THEY THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5538	WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICE THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRIGHT
Line_5539	THAT WHEN YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERIES THEY YOU COULDN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
Line_5540	YE CANT UNDER STAND
Line_5541	UM WHAT YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLELL WOULD IT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
Line_5542	UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOOD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS THAT WHENE ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
Line_5543	WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'E SEPARAT AND ONE HAT I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS A SERIES
Line_5544	WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
Line_5545	I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5546	WELL SINCE  ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULBS BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
Line_5547	BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
Line_5548	I THINK ILD SAY PARALLEL CIRCUIT
Line_5549	WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNET
Line_5550	AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOCX AND TAPE IT THEN USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
Line_5551	THERE IS CUBER
Line_5552	AND UM SUM I FR
Line_5553	E WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE OTHER GROUPS HIT EM SOMEHERE IN THE COBRBOCKX AND WE TRYED TO FIND IT
Line_5554	OH WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPAS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX AND THEN WE SCIERCHED THAT AREA
Line_5555	THE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
Line_5556	HERE IS METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THERE IS A METAL OR A LIKE AT'S ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
Line_5557	TO T SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER A MAGNET
Line_5558	UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TEKNICALLY FINDS UM METAL
Line_5559	WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIN METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
Line_5560	YEAH WHAT'S MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUP
Line_5561	Y USING LIKE A NEAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOCKX AND FIND IT TIL IT FIELS
Line_5562	THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY UM STICK TO CERTAN KINDS
Line_5563	IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHERE EVER IT WAS
Line_5564	NO IT DID NOT  JUST A KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREEVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLAIT
Line_5565	UM I'M NOT REALLY SHOUR
Line_5566	THE THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LETHEN SIDE THE PENSIL
Line_5567	YES SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION
Line_5568	THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEI'R DOT IS HEAVY AND THEY'ARE NOT A STRONG
Line_5569	I SEE THAT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE ONE IS WEK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
Line_5570	I'M NOT QUITE SHOURE
Line_5571	YOU THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SHURE
Line_5572	BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MAT A MAGNET
Line_5573	THE ROCK I SANK AND THE
Line_5574	THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON IT TURNS OFF
Line_5575	ITIT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
Line_5576	UH WE ALSO UM MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
Line_5577	IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD TO UM PLAY AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
Line_5578	UUM WHA YEA
Line_5579	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHIRCAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
Line_5580	HE ENERCHIES UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
Line_5581	U CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
Line_5582	UMH WE PUT IT UNDER
Line_5583	WELL IN MY OPPINION I WOULOD I I DON'T THINK SO
Line_5584	BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE THING INS SIDE OF IT
Line_5585	UH WE HAD THOSE LITTLE SAMBUS AND WE SAW UM IN A KEE AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
Line_5586	UH LIKE THE BATTERY WAS AND LIGHT BULB IN ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
Line_5587	I SEE IS A LIGHT BUB THE IRONS AND THE BATTERY
Line_5588	UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BUT
Line_5589	UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
Line_5590	I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
Line_5591	UM THE DRAWNS RELAT BECAUSE UM EVERY THING COMES BACK TO WERE'S SATTERD BUT IT GOES A WAGE FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
Line_5592	U IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
Line_5593	I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
Line_5594	WE HAVE LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY AND THI SLOW AND THEN HUOK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HOUOK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO
Line_5595	THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THET THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
Line_5596	UM I GUESS
Line_5597	UM WELL THE THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
Line_5598	THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HOKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLEAIT
Line_5599	IF THEY'RE NOT HUCKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN GET TO THE LIGHT
Line_5600	THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE U ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
Line_5601	THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL ON TO THE PLAIT
Line_5602	UM WELLV AND SINCE THERE IS TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
Line_5603	BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE IS MORE POWER
Line_5604	THEY'RE NO THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
Line_5605	THERE ARE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
Line_5606	I NOTICE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
Line_5607	IF THEY'RE NOT IT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5608	THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BUB THEND COMES DOWN INTO  THE OTHER ONE AND COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5609	THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
Line_5610	THE ITTHE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY
Line_5611	THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT INTO THE OTHER SIDE
Line_5612	I THINK THERE IS A UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES
Line_5613	IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS THESE CIMBLES AND IT THEY'RE ON THIS
Line_5614	UM I'M NOT QUITE SHURE BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
Line_5615	UM ID NOT QUIT
Line_5616	WE MEADE A MAGNET THAT CAN  TURN OFF AND ON
Line_5617	UH WEIGHT WHAT ANED
Line_5618	WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE PUM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE SO RIVET
Line_5619	WE ALSO HAV TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
Line_5620	NO THINGS HAPPENING
Line_5621	WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAGN THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5622	THE RIVET IS A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
Line_5623	WELL I'M NOT YET QUITE SHURE BUT I THINK IT'S U SPECIAL METAL BU I'M NOT QUITE SURE OFIT
Line_5624	NOW THEY WON'T
Line_5625	THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
Line_5626	WE TRIED THAT A NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO POWER GOING INTO IT
Line_5627	WE USE JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
Line_5628	I DON'T THINK SO BUT I NOT SHURE IF I'M CORRECTED JUST IN MY OPPINION
Line_5629	WELL IF THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF HE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
Line_5630	UM WE ULL SO JUST WHEIN I FORGET
Line_5631	WE WE JUST TRIED UM THE WIRE TOUCHING IT INSTEAD OF RAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
Line_5632	THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVET SO THEN IT CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
Line_5633	WE ASSK OR HELP FROM MIDARMOCINIE ANE TOLED US TO Y RAPPING IT AROUND THE RIVEN
Line_5634	THE WASHERS GOT UM THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
Line_5635	WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UN ELECTRICITY
Line_5636	WE'VE BEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE MAKE THE LIGHTS TURNON
Line_5637	UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FUMELECOF ELECTRICITY
Line_5638	UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
Line_5639	WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN IGH MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
Line_5640	IT MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THAN YOU WILL NEAED MOREYOU'RE
Line_5641	NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
Line_5642	GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END
Line_5643	YES YOU CAN STILL MAKE U A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
Line_5644	YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGER THEN WITH ONE BATTERY
Line_5645	THE BATTERYY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT
Line_5646	YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN THE RONG PLACE
Line_5647	WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE AND
Line_5648	IN THE RONG IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE INE
Line_5649	AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY LY BE UN THE  POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5650	THEY HAVE TO BE AND THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT TO
Line_5651	UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
Line_5652	YES I I YES I HAVE
Line_5653	YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
Line_5654	THIS WILLND WALK TWO PROBABLY
Line_5655	BULE UM THE
Line_5656	WEL THE STEEL WIRES SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5657	IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL TO ANY STEEL OR IRON MADE OBJECT
Line_5658	UM THER
Line_5659	NO BECAUSE A SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
Line_5660	UM SO THE NSO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THEN NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
Line_5661	UM I FORGOT THE NAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
Line_5662	UM YES IT ISE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5663	YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5664	WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
Line_5665	WENO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMALAR TO THIS
Line_5666	UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
Line_5667	WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
Line_5668	UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
Line_5669	UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU RAP THE WIRE AROUNTD THE RIVET THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAINST
Line_5670	YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CAN NOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
Line_5671	AND THEY BOTH WORKED WITH EACH OTHER
Line_5672	YES THAT IS RIGHT
Line_5673	YES SCIENCE IS VERY QUIL
Line_5674	UM WE'RE SEEING THAT HOW MANY
Line_5675	IPS IT TAKES TO SE IF WHEN
Line_5676	WHEN THE MAGNET DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5677	THERE ARE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER AND ONE WASHERS GOING INTO A CUP E FIT UNHOOKED THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5678	IT'S SEEN HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO UN HOOK TWO MAGNETS
Line_5679	U IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
Line_5680	THEY ARE BEING D CHACED FROM EACH OTHER BY THE WASHERS
Line_5681	THEY O BEN DETRACTED AND
Line_5682	YES THAT IT'S HAVING TO THE MAGNETS
Line_5683	WHEN YOU PUTCH THE ONE WASHER THE ONE WASHER TO SEPARATES THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5684	YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GAT WITH STICKERS
Line_5685	YES IT DOS TELL US
Line_5686	USHERS IT TAKES TO BAKE THE FORCE
Line_5687	HOW MANY WASH METAL WASHERS IT TAKES TO BAKE THE FOS
Line_5688	THE MORE THE METAL WASHERS THE MORE LIKELY IT TAKES TO BMICK THE MAGNETIC FOURSE
Line_5689	I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
Line_5690	THE MOTOR UM HUD THE WIRE THE
Line_5691	THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UP RIGHT IT SPUNGE
Line_5692	WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
Line_5693	THE BACHERY A BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WEL YOU MEAN BY THAT
Line_5694	THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
Line_5695	THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DIDN'T SCIENCE WHERE WE USED  THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5696	YOU WOULD PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BODLE MUGH CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
Line_5697	I SEE THAT
Line_5698	THE ELECT THAT WHATEVER IS IN HERE IS THITS A LIGHT BULB I THINK
Line_5699	IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S TH IT L IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KINDV LIKE A SCRA RIGHT NOW
Line_5700	LECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
Line_5701	THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
Line_5702	YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTER THINK
Line_5703	THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPONING
Line_5704	NO IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
Line_5705	THE THINGS THAT T THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND AE PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
Line_5706	NEAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
Line_5707	T THE MAGNET CAN GO WITH THREE THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT COULD GO THROUGH
Line_5708	ES I HAVE ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT MAGNET
Line_5709	UM WE BILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEHERE WER DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND OU
Line_5710	WHEN THE MITTLE SHAVINGS FROM THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
Line_5711	BECAUSE  MAGNETS ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
Line_5712	UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF U THEAND MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARD BORD
Line_5713	UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIER THAN THE THREE
Line_5714	ECAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE WASHERS
Line_5715	HERE'S SOMETHING CLOSE BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNETS IT WILL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WIS CONFUSING ME
Line_5716	A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF ITS STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOULD KNOW WHERE IT WAS YEAH
Line_5717	AND WHEN IT STICKS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FIEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'L KNOW THAT THE MAGNETS THERE
Line_5718	WE ATTATCHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE AMEINOFF SWITCH
Line_5719	THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON EN OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE UNENUGH SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
Line_5720	WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR IS NOT GOIN A WRUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR WREALL RUN
Line_5721	TOR IF THE MOTOR 'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
Line_5722	UM ALSO IN SCIENCE SO WE HAVE TAKEN A UM OH WHAT DO I DO I FORG
Line_5723	IT FLOWES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
Line_5724	IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
Line_5725	YOU OULD PUT BOTHE WIRES AT THE BOLM OF THE BULB
Line_5726	IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SENCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCHE UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
Line_5727	ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRES CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
Line_5728	UM YEAH M BECAUSE WE TRIED THAT ACCUPL OF TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL
Line_5729	YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTRA MAGNET
Line_5730	SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THE'RE CALLED
Line_5731	UH NO ALUMINIUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
Line_5732	ELL THE WAY WE DID IT IS THAT SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH UH YOU COULD
Line_5733	SWITCH UM UN CONNECT UM CONNECTED SO THE ELECTRO MAGNET CAN NOT SO THE ELECTRICT
Line_5734	CAN NOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET UM IT ILL GO THROUGH
Line_5735	THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
Line_5736	ELECTRICITYS FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
Line_5737	OWER IS GETTING TROUBLE THROUGH
Line_5738	THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
Line_5739	THE REASON TAT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT CIRIE TO GET HOT
Line_5740	THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE BATTERY
Line_5741	THE WASH THE M THE ELECTRICITY 'S GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
Line_5742	IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MORNING IN SIENCE
Line_5743	WE'VE BEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRO MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5744	WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
Line_5745	THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP WASHERS VERY EASILY
Line_5746	YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5747	THE WIRE ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY T FLOW THROUGH SO THAT  MIX THE ELECTRO MAGNET
Line_5748	INSOLATION MEANS LIKE  THE COPPER WIRE IS END SIDE OF THE GREEN COTING
Line_5749	THAT YOU WRAP IT AWROUND AND YOU TURN OT A SWITCH
Line_5750	WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS TASTAGS MAGNETIC
Line_5751	THE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND YES BUT IT
Line_5752	I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERY TIME IT CLICK
Line_5753	IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
Line_5754	THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN THE ELECTRICITY CAN NOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
Line_5755	I OBSERVED WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
Line_5756	IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CAN NOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
Line_5757	NO WE HAVE NOT YET
Line_5758	LEARNIN BY ELECTRICITY AND MAGNET ISM
Line_5759	THAT OME SIDES UM STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON THE CENDER SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK IT UM LETS GO APPART
Line_5760	THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
Line_5761	THAT IT WILL UM THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVSE STEEL IN IT
Line_5762	WACK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
Line_5763	UM THE ONES WITH IRN AND STEEL ON THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
Line_5764	STEEL ONLY HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINIUM NAOW IS ALUTIMAM LUNIMUM DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
Line_5765	THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM IS REPEAELING THE OTHER
Line_5766	IF THE POLES ARE FASING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK BUT IF THEY'RE FASING E PART THEY'LL SEPARATE
Line_5767	MAGNETTS ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
Line_5768	CIND SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK FOR THE MAGNET TEZ THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE
Line_5769	THEN NINTEEN WASHERS BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
Line_5770	UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS TWO HEAVIY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
Line_5771	MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROBABLY SEPARATE QUICKER
Line_5772	SPACERS AND BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FOURCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASHER
Line_5773	THE MAGNETS UM WE PELLED THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACES TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
Line_5774	DON'T PUT ANY SPACERS IN YOU'L GET A HIR NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACERS IN YOU'L GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
Line_5775	THE MAGNET WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
Line_5776	WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND DOWN JUST CET IT UP RIGHT
Line_5777	FOLLOW THE INSDRUCTIONS AND BE CREATERVE
Line_5778	WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
Line_5779	THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF AELECTRICITY D TURN ON SOMETHING
Line_5780	THERE ARE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB
Line_5781	M I FORGET IT'S NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN ES AND IT USES SIMBLES TO TELL UM INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE DTAILES
Line_5782	INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
Line_5783	THIS SHOWES YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
Line_5784	THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NE WIRES
Line_5785	YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWES TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP
Line_5786	TO DAY WE GET THIS FUNMISTER THING WITH WAU FINDING WIRES
Line_5787	END NO WIRES CONNECTED TO E B
Line_5788	HIDE MY NAME IS JONAWH
